<p>The legislature finds that credit unions provide many valuable services to the consumers of this state and will be better prepared to continue providing these services if the Washington state credit union act is modernized, clarified, and reorganized.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the legislature finds that credit unions and credit union members will benefit by enacting provisions clearly specifying the director of financial institutions' authority to enforce statutory provisions.</p>
<p>Revisions to this chapter reflect the legislature's intent to modernize, clarify, and reorganize the existing act, and specify the director's enforcement authority. By enacting the revisions to this chapter, it is not the intent of the legislature to affect the scope of credit unions' field of membership or tax status, or impact federal parity provisions.</p>

<p>After December 31, 1998, credit unions must be insured under the federal share insurance program or an equivalent share insurance program as defined in this section. For the purposes of this section an equivalent share insurance program is a program that: (a) Holds reserves proportionately equal to the federal share insurance program; (b) maintains adequate reserves and access to additional sources of funds through replenishment features, reinsurance, or other sources of funds; and (c) has share insurance contracts that reflect a national geographic diversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before any credit union may insure its share deposits with a share insurance program other than the federal share insurance program, the director must make a finding that the alternative share insurance program meets the standards set forth in this section, following a public hearing and a report on the basis for such finding to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature. All such findings shall be made before December 1st of any year and shall not take effect until the end of the regular legislative session of the following year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any alternative share insurance program approved under this section shall be reviewed annually by the director to determine whether the program currently meets the standards in this section. The director shall prepare a written report of his or her findings including supporting analysis and forward the report to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature. If the director finds that the alternative share insurance program does not currently meet the standards of this section the director shall notify all credit unions that insure their shares under the alternative share insurance program, and shall include notice of a public hearing for the purpose of receiving comment on the director's finding. Following the hearing the director may either rescind his or her finding or reaffirm the finding that the alternative share insurance program does not meet the standards in this section. If the finding is reaffirmed, the director shall order all credit unions whose shares are insured with the alternative share insurance program to file, immediately, an application with the national credit union administration to convert to the federal share insurance program.</p>

<p>Upon a vote to liquidate under subsection (1) of this section, a three-person liquidating committee must be elected to liquidate the assets of the credit union.

The funds may be deposited in one or more financial institutions to the credit of the director, in trust for the members of the credit union entitled to the funds. The director may pay a portion of the funds to a person upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that the person is entitled to the funds. In case of doubt or conflicting claims, the director may require an order of the superior court of the county in which the principal place of business of the credit union was located, authorizing and directing the payment of the funds. The director may apply the interest earned by the funds toward defraying the expenses incurred in the holding and paying of the funds. Five years after the receipt of the funds, the funds still remaining with the director must be remitted to the state as unclaimed property.</p>

<p>Upon taking possession of a credit union, the receiver shall proceed to collect the assets of the credit union and preserve, administer, and liquidate its business and assets.</p>
<p>With the approval of the Thurston county superior court or the superior court of the county in which the principal place of business of the credit union is located, the receiver may sell, compound, or compromise bad or doubtful debts, and upon such terms as the court may direct, borrow, mortgage, pledge, or sell all or any part of the real and personal property of the credit union. The receiver may deliver to each purchaser or lender an appropriate deed, mortgage, agreement of pledge, or other instrument of title or security. The receiver may employ an attorney or other assistants to assist in carrying out the receivership, subject to such surety bond as the director may require. The premium for any such bond must be paid out of the assets of the credit union.</p>
<p>In carrying out the receivership, the receiver may without limitation arrange for the merger or consolidation of the credit union in receivership with another credit union, out-of-state credit union, or federal credit union, or may arrange for the purchase of the credit union's assets and the assumption of its liabilities by such a credit union, in whole or in part, or may arrange for such a transaction with another type of financial institution as may be otherwise permitted by law. The receiver shall give preference to transactions with a credit union or a federal credit union that has its principal place of business in this state.</p>

The receiver shall mail similar notices to all persons whose names appear as creditors upon the books of the credit union. The assets of the credit union are not subject to contingent claims.</p>
<p>After the expiration of the time fixed in the notice, the receiver has no power to accept any claim except the claim of a depositor or share account holder, and all other claims are barred. Claims of depositors or share account holders may be presented after the expiration of the time fixed in the notice and may be approved by the receiver. If such a claim is approved, the depositor or share account holder is entitled to its proportion of prior liquidation dividends, if sufficient funds are available for it, and will share in the distribution of the remaining assets.</p>
<p>The receiver may approve or reject any claim, but shall serve notice of rejection upon the claimant by mail or personally. An affidavit of service of the notice of rejection will serve as prima facie evidence that notice was given. No action may be brought on any claim after three months from the date of service of the notice of rejection.</p>
