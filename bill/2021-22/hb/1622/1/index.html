<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most organizations recognize that the didactic training of health care professionals performing the medical forensic examination should consist of at least 40 hours;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training of sexual assault nurse examiners should include hands-on clinical skills training and competency checks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disparities persist between the training that is available to nurses in rural communities, including a lack of hands-on clinical skills training and a lack of 40-hour didactic classes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best practice for the clinical education of nurses includes the use of simulation in an interdisciplinary context;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of equal access to 40-hour didactic classes and supporting the development of clinical training mechanisms will help to ensure consistency and quality of care throughout the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington State University has the capacity to offer high quality, simulation-based, inter-professional training for sexual assault nurse examiners and to increase access to education for nurses in rural communities.</p>
</li>
