<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that high-potency marijuana products are increasingly prevalent in the market. Whereas the THC concentration of marijuana-infused edible products is limited to 10 percent by state law and the THC concentration of marijuana flower is biologically limited, there is currently no limit on the potency of marijuana concentrates such as THC-infused vape oils. High-potency marijuana products are readily available with a THC concentration of almost 100 percent. Prior to Washington legalizing marijuana sales, many of these extremely high-potency products did not exist or were not widely available. By 2019, sales of high-potency marijuana concentrates had grown to nearly 40 percent of total sales of marijuana products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that Washington state's most prominent cannabis researchers at the University of Washington and Washington State University recently released a consensus statement about the health risks posed by high-potency cannabis products. That statement summarizes the best available science: &quot;Use of cannabis with high THC concentration increases the chances of developing cannabis use disorder or addiction to cannabis, particularly among adolescents. High-potency cannabis use can have lifelong mental health consequences, which often manifest in adolescence or early adulthood. Daily cannabis use, particularly of high-potency products, increases the risk of developing a psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia, and is related to an earlier onset of symptoms compared to people who do not use cannabis.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to protect public health and safety by limiting the potency of cannabis concentrates and raising the age of purchase for cannabis concentrates.</p>
