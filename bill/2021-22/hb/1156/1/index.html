<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/29A_elections/29A.52_primaries_and_elections.html">29A.52</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/29A_elections/29A.52_primaries_and_elections.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a county, city, town, school district, fire district, or port district may conduct its elections using ranked choice voting. A county, city, town, school district, fire district, or port district that adopts ranked choice voting may, but need not, use ranked choice voting for all offices in an election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city, town, school district, fire district, or port district that has voters in more than one county may conduct an election using ranked choice voting only if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Another city, town, or district that lies entirely within at least two of the counties in which the city, town, or district has voters uses ranked choice voting; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court orders the use of ranked choice voting as provided in this section as a remedy under RCW 29A.92.110.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ranked choice voting may not be used in an election for an office for which two or fewer candidates are competing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An election using ranked choice voting must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The county auditor shall design the ballot to allow a voter to rank the candidates for a particular office in order of preference, including one write-in candidate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor must allow a voter to rank at least five candidates per office. The secretary of state must adopt rules that determine the maximum number of candidates per office that a voter is allowed to rank on a ballot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A voter does not need to rank the maximum number of candidates. The county auditor shall count a ballot regardless of how many candidates the voter has ranked. The county auditor shall not assign votes for rankings made by a voter that are greater than the maximum number of rankings allowed for each office;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a voter skips one or more numbers in ranking candidates, or ranks an invalid write-in candidate, the county auditor shall assign any votes after the skipped number to the voter's next-highest ranked candidates as if the voter had not skipped the number;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a voter provides the same number ranking to more than one candidate, the county auditor may not assign that vote ranking to any candidate and may not assign a vote for any subsequent number ranking for that office;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the election is a single-winner contest, including an election in which multiple positions with the same name, district number, or title are dealt with as separate offices, the winner of each contest must be determined using the instant runoff voting method, as defined in this section and further provided in secretary of state rules. If the election is a multiple-winner contest in which the positions are not dealt with as separate offices, the winners must be determined using the single transferable vote method, as defined in this section and further provided in secretary of state rules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the requisite number of officers have not been elected, or selected to continue to further rounds of vote tabulation, by reason of two or more persons having an equal and highest number of votes for the same office, the official empowered by state law to issue the original certificate of election shall resolve the tie using the tie-breaking method selected by the county, city, town, or district as provided in RCW 29A.60.221.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county, city, town, or district that conducts an election using ranked choice voting must either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Eliminate the primary for the election; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold a primary using the single transferable vote method to winnow candidates for the election to a final list of five candidates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county, city, town, or district that adopts ranked choice voting before 2022 shall implement ranked choice voting for elections beginning in 2024. A county, city, town, or district that adopts ranked choice voting during or after 2022 must implement ranked choice voting within two years following its adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor whose county encompasses a county, city, town, or district that adopts ranked choice voting shall assist with the implementation of the system. If a city, town, or district has voters in two or more counties, each county auditor in which the city, town, or district has voters shall assist with implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of state, before July 1, 2023, and in consultation with the ranked choice voting work group created in section 15 of this act, shall adopt rules to administer this section. The secretary's rules must address, at minimum:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Procedures for administering an election that includes voters in more than one county as provided in subsection (2) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures for tabulating votes under the instant runoff voting method and single transferable vote method as provided in subsection (4) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank for each office as provided in subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of state shall develop educational materials for the public and provide training for county auditors to implement ranked choice voting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Ranked choice voting&quot; means a system of counting votes in which votes are tabulated based on a voter's ranking of candidates in order of preference as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Instant runoff voting method&quot; means a system of counting votes in which the ballots are counted in rounds simulating a series of runoffs until two candidates remain or until one candidate has a majority of all votes counting in that round. The candidate having the greatest number of votes is declared the winner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Single transferable vote method&quot; means a system of counting votes in which a winning threshold is calculated based on the number of seats to be filled and the number of votes cast so that no more than the correct number of candidates can win. The ballots must be counted in rounds, with surplus votes transferred from winning candidates and candidates with the fewest votes eliminated according to the methodology established by the secretary of state in rules adopted under subsection (8) of this section, until the number of candidates remaining equals the number of seats to be filled.</p>

<p>General municipal elections in second‑class cities shall be held biennially <strong>on the date provided in RCW 29A.04.330</strong> and shall be subject to general election law.</p>
<p>The terms of office of the mayor, city attorney, clerk, and treasurer shall be four years and until their successors are elected and qualified and assume office in accordance with RCW 29A.60.280: PROVIDED, That if the offices of city attorney, clerk, and treasurer are made appointive, the city attorney, clerk, and treasurer shall not be appointed for a definite term: PROVIDED FURTHER, That the term of the elected treasurer shall not commence in the same biennium in which the term of the mayor commences, nor in which the terms of the city attorney and clerk commence if they are elected.</p>
<p>Council positions shall be numbered in each second‑class city so that council position seven has a two-year term of office and council positions one through six shall each have four-year terms of office. Each councilmember shall remain in office until a successor is elected and qualified and assumes office in accordance with RCW 29A.60.280.</p>
<p>In its discretion the council of a second‑class city may divide the city by ordinance, into a convenient number of wards, not exceeding six, fix the boundaries of the wards, and change the ward boundaries from time to time and as provided in RCW 29A.76.010. No change in the boundaries of any ward shall be made within one hundred twenty days next before the date of a general municipal election, nor within twenty months after the wards have been established or altered unless pursuant to RCW 29A.92.040 or 29A.92.110. However, if a boundary change results in one ward being represented by more councilmembers than the number to which it is entitled, those having the shortest unexpired terms shall be assigned by the council to wards where there is a vacancy, and the councilmembers so assigned shall be deemed to be residents of the wards to which they are assigned for purposes of determining whether those positions are vacant.</p>
<p>Whenever such city is so divided into wards, the city council shall designate by ordinance the number of councilmembers to be elected from each ward, apportioning the same in proportion to the population of the wards. Thereafter the councilmembers so designated shall be elected by the voters resident in such ward, or by general vote of the whole city as may be designated in such ordinance. Council position seven shall not be associated with a ward and the person elected to that position may reside anywhere in the city and voters throughout the city may vote at a primary to nominate candidates for position seven, when a primary is necessary, and at a general election to elect the person to council position seven. Additional territory that is added to the city shall, by act of the council, be annexed to contiguous wards without affecting the right to redistrict at the expiration of twenty months after last previous division. The removal of a councilmember from the ward for which he or she was elected shall create a vacancy in such office.</p>
<p>Wards shall be redrawn as provided in chapter 29A.76 RCW. Wards shall be used as follows: (1) Only a resident of the ward may be a candidate for, or hold office as, a councilmember of the ward; and (2) only voters of the ward may vote at a primary to nominate candidates for a councilmember of the ward. Voters of the entire city may vote at the general election to elect a councilmember of a ward, unless the city had prior to January 1, 1994, limited the voting in the general election for any or all council positions to only voters residing within the ward associated with the council positions. If a city had so limited the voting in the general election to only voters residing within the ward, then the city shall be authorized to continue to do so. The elections for the remaining council position or council positions that are not associated with a ward shall be conducted as if the wards did not exist.</p>

<li>
<p>The political subdivision shall work in good faith with the person providing the notice to implement a remedy that provides the protected class or classes identified in the notice an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. Such work in good faith to implement a remedy may include, but is not limited to consideration of: (a) Relevant electoral data; (b) relevant demographic data, including the most recent census data available; and (c) any other information that would be relevant to implementing a remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the political subdivision adopts a remedy that takes the notice into account, or adopts the notice's proposed remedy, the political subdivision shall seek a court order acknowledging that the political subdivision's remedy complies with RCW 29A.92.020 and was prompted by a plausible violation. The person who submitted the notice may support or oppose such an order, and may obtain public records to do so. The political subdivision must provide all political, census, and demographic data and any analysis of that data used to develop the remedy in its filings seeking the court order and with any documents made public. All facts and reasonable inferences shall be viewed in the light most favorable to those opposing the political subdivision's proposed remedy at this stage. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the court will decline to approve the political subdivision's proposed remedy at this stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court concludes that the political subdivision's remedy complies with RCW 29A.92.020, an action under this chapter may not be brought against that political subdivision for four years by any party so long as the political subdivision does not enact a change to or deviation from the remedy during this four-year period that would otherwise give rise to an action under this chapter.</p>
