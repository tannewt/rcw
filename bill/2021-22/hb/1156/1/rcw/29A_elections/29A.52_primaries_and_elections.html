<p>A primary is a first stage in the public process by which voters elect candidates to public office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever candidates for a partisan office are to be elected, the general election must be preceded by a primary conducted under this chapter**, unless the county, city, town, or district is conducting the general election using ranked choice voting as provided in section 1 of this act and has chosen not to use a primary**. Based upon votes cast at the primary, the top two candidates**, or the top five candidates in a primary for a general election conducted using ranked choice voting as provided in section 1 of this act,** will be certified as qualified to appear on the general election ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No primary may be held for any single county partisan office to fill an unexpired term if, after the last day allowed for candidates to withdraw**:**</p>
<ol type="a">

<p><strong>In a primary for a general election conducted using ranked choice voting as provided in section 1 of this act, five or fewer candidates have filed for the position</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For partisan office, if a candidate has expressed a party preference on the declaration of candidacy, then that preference will be shown after the name of the candidate on the primary and general election ballots as set forth in rules of the secretary of state. A candidate may choose to express no party preference. Any party preferences are shown for the information of voters only and may in no way limit the options available to voters.</p>

<p>The office of precinct committee officer must be voted upon at the primary election in each even-numbered year. If no one files for the office, the office shall be filled in accordance with *RCW 29A.28.071.

Only contested races may appear on the ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ballot format may be either a consolidated ballot or a physically separate ballot. If a consolidated ballot is used, the races for precinct committee officer must be clearly delineated from other races on the ballot. If a physically separate ballot is used, it must be distinguishable from the top two primary ballot. If the ballot is returned in the return envelope provided, but outside of the security envelope, it shall not be grounds to invalidate the ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following instructions must appear on the ballot: &quot;In order to vote for precinct committee officer, a partisan office, you must affirm that you are a Democrat or a Republican and may vote only for one candidate from the party you select. Your vote for a candidate affirms your affiliation with the same party as the candidate. This preference is private and will not be matched to your name or shared.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Party affiliation is affirmed by including the following statement after the name of each candidate: &quot;I affirm I am a Democrat.&quot; if the candidate is a Democrat, or &quot;I affirm I am a Republican.&quot; if the candidate is a Republican.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a voter votes for candidates from both parties, the votes cast in the election for precinct committee officer on that ballot will not be tabulated and reported.</p>

<p>Procedures for administering an election that includes voters in more than one county as provided in subsection (2) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures for tabulating votes under the instant runoff voting method and single transferable vote method as provided in subsection (4) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank for each office as provided in subsection (4) of this section.</p>

<li>
<p>As used in this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Ranked choice voting&quot; means a system of counting votes in which votes are tabulated based on a voter's ranking of candidates in order of preference as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Instant runoff voting method&quot; means a system of counting votes in which the ballots are counted in rounds simulating a series of runoffs until two candidates remain or until one candidate has a majority of all votes counting in that round. The candidate having the greatest number of votes is declared the winner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Single transferable vote method&quot; means a system of counting votes in which a winning threshold is calculated based on the number of seats to be filled and the number of votes cast so that no more than the correct number of candidates can win. The ballots must be counted in rounds, with surplus votes transferred from winning candidates and candidates with the fewest votes eliminated according to the methodology established by the secretary of state in rules adopted under subsection (8) of this section, until the number of candidates remaining equals the number of seats to be filled.</p>
