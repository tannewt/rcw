<ol>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 public health response account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. The account shall consist of funds appropriated by the legislature and grants received by the department of health for activities in response to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Only the secretary, or the secretary's designee, may authorize expenditures from the account for costs related to the public health response to COVID-19, subject to any limitations imposed by grant funding deposited into the account. The COVID-19 public health response account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that a safe, efficient, and effective delivery of vaccinations is of the utmost importance for restoring societal and economic functions. As we learn more about the virus, the vaccine, and challenges to vaccine allocation and distribution, it is anticipated that the state's COVID-19 vaccination distribution plan will evolve. To that end, the legislature has provided flexibility by funding vaccine expenditure at the discretion of the secretary and without an appropriation. However, to maintain fiscal control and to ensure spending priorities align, the department is required to collaborate and communicate with the chairs and ranking members of the health care and fiscal committees of the legislature and local health jurisdictions in advance of any significant revision of the state's COVID-19 vaccination plan and to provide regular updates on its implementation and spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of the public health response to COVID-19, the expenditures from the account must be used to effectively administer the vaccine for COVID-19 and conduct testing and contact tracing. The department must ensure that COVID-19 outreach is accessible, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and that it includes community-driven partnerships and strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making expenditures for administering the vaccine for COVID-19, the department must focus on identifying persons for vaccination, prioritizing hard-to-reach communities, making the vaccine accessible, and providing support to schools for safe reopening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making expenditures regarding testing and contact tracing, the department must provide equitable access, prioritize hard-to-reach communities, and provide support and resources to facilitate the safe reopening of schools while minimizing community spread of the virus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making expenditures from the account, the department must include an emphasis on public communication regarding the availability and accessibility of the vaccine and testing, and the importance of vaccine and testing availability to the safe reopening of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department must report to the fiscal and health care committees of the legislature on a monthly basis regarding its COVID-19 response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that it is available, the report must include data regarding vaccine distribution, testing, and contact tracing, as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The number of vaccines administered per day, including regional data regarding the location and age groups of persons receiving the vaccine, specifically identifying hard-to-reach communities in which vaccines were administered; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of tests conducted per week, including data specifically addressing testing conducted in hard-to-reach communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first monthly report is due no later than one month from the effective date of this section. Monthly reports are no longer required upon the department's determination that the remaining balance of the COVID-19 response account is less than $100,000.</p>
