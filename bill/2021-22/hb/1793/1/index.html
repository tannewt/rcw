<p>A unit owners association may not adopt or enforce a restriction, covenant, condition, bylaw, rule, regulation, provision of a governing document, or master deed provision that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Effectively prohibits or unreasonably restricts the installation or use of an electric vehicle charging station in compliance with the requirements of this section and for the personal noncommercial use of a unit owner, within the boundaries of a unit or in a designated parking space; or</p>

<li>
<p>Is in conflict with the provisions of this section.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section prohibits an association from imposing reasonable restrictions on electric vehicle charging stations. However, it is the policy of the state to promote, encourage, and remove obstacles to the use of electric vehicle charging stations.</p>

<li>
<p>If approval is required for the installation or use of an electric vehicle charging station, the application for approval must be processed and approved in the same manner as an application for approval of an architectural modification.</p>

<p>The approval or denial of an application must be in writing and must not be willfully avoided or delayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an application is not denied in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the application, the application is deemed approved, unless that delay is the result of a reasonable request for additional information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An association may not assess or charge a unit owner a fee for the placement of an electric vehicle charging station. An association may charge a reasonable fee for processing the application to approve the installation of an electric vehicle charging station, but only if such a fee exists for all applications for approval of architectural modifications.</p>

<li>
<p>If approval is required for the installation or use of an electric vehicle charging station, a unit owners association must approve the installation within the boundaries of a unit or in a designated parking space if the installation is reasonably possible and the unit owner agrees in writing to:</p>

<li>
<p>Comply with the association's reasonable architectural standards applicable to the installation of the electric vehicle charging station;</p>

<p>A certificate of insurance required under (c)(i) of this subsection must be provided within 14 days after the association approves the installation of the electric vehicle charging station.

<p>If installation of an electric vehicle charging station within the boundaries of a unit or in a designated parking space is impossible or unreasonably expensive, a unit owners association may authorize the installation of an electric vehicle charging station for the exclusive use of an owner in a common element that is not a limited common element designated for the use of that owner. In such cases, the association may enter into a license agreement with the owner for the use of the space in a common element, and the owner must comply with the requirements of this section.</p>

<p>An electric vehicle charging station installed at the unit owner's cost is property of the unit owner. Upon sale of the unit, if the charging station is removable, the unit owner may either remove it or sell it to the buyer of the unit or to the association for an agreed price.

<li>
<p>If a unit owners association reasonably determines that the cumulative use of electricity in the common interest community attributable to the installation and use of electric vehicle charging stations requires the installation of additional infrastructure improvements to provide the community with a sufficient supply of electricity, the association may assess the cost of the infrastructure improvements against each unit owner that has, or will, install an electric vehicle charging station.</p>

<li>
<p>A unit owners association may install an electric vehicle charging station in the common elements for the use of all unit owners and, in that case, the association must develop appropriate terms of use for the charging station.</p>
