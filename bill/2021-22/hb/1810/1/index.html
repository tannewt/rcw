<h2 id="section-1-3436">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3436">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that access to appropriate and affordable digital electronic products is necessary to overcome digital inequities in Washington state and that broader distribution of the information and tools necessary to repair digital electronic products will shorten repair times and lower costs for consumers.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has made the need for devices even more critical as people rely on digital electronic devices to submit unemployment claims, join telehealth appointments, attend work and school, connect with family and friends, and generally access services from the safety of their home. The legislature recognizes that people will continue to need digital electronic products to function for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that low-income and black Washingtonians face disproportionate barriers to accessing internet in their homes. Recent census household pulse survey data shows that a computer is rarely or never available for children's educational use in 59 percent of households experiencing poverty and 80 percent of black households in Washington state. Also, electronic product manufacturer shops or licensed repair shops can often be in urban areas, requiring rural consumers to travel long distances for repair.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that independent repair businesses provide an important source of employment and contribute to a competitive repair market. In addition, these small business employees can more safely repair devices when appropriate parts and information are readily accessible.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that digital electronic products are comprised of precious metals that are finite and unnecessary early disposal can be avoided with proper repair.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to broaden access to the information and tools necessary to repair digital electronic products in a safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable manner, thereby increasing access to appropriate and affordable digital electronic products, supporting small businesses and jobs, and making it easier for all residents of Washington state to connect digitally.</p>
