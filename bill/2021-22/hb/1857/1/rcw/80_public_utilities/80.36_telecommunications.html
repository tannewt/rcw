<p>The legislature declares that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Changes in technology and the structure of the telecommunications industry may produce conditions under which traditional rate of return, rate base regulation of telecommunications companies may not in all cases provide the most efficient and effective means of achieving the public policy goals of this state as declared in RCW 80.36.300, this section, and RCW 80.36.145. The commission should be authorized to employ an alternative form of regulation if that alternative is better suited to achieving those policy goals.</p>

<li>
<p>Because of the great diversity in the scope and type of services provided by telecommunications companies, alternative regulatory arrangements that meet the varying circumstances of different companies and their ratepayers may be desirable.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to the conditions set forth in this chapter and RCW 80.04.130, the commission may regulate telecommunications companies subject to traditional rate of return, rate base regulation by authorizing an alternative form of regulation. The commission may determine the manner and extent of any alternative forms of regulation as may in the public interest be appropriate. In addition to the public policy goals declared in RCW 80.36.300, the commission shall consider, in determining the appropriateness of any proposed alternative form of regulation, whether it will:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Facilitate the broad deployment of technological improvements and advanced telecommunications services to underserved areas or underserved customer classes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the efficiency of the regulatory process;</p>

<li>
<p>Preserve or enhance the development of effective competition and protect against the exercise of market power during its development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preserve or enhance service quality and protect against the degradation of the quality or availability of efficient telecommunications services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for rates and charges that are fair, just, reasonable, sufficient, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not unduly or unreasonably prejudice or disadvantage any particular customer class.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A telecommunications company or companies subject to traditional rate of return, rate base regulation may petition the commission to establish an alternative form of regulation. The company or companies shall submit with the petition a plan for an alternative form of regulation. The plan shall contain a proposal for transition to the alternative form of regulation and the proposed duration of the plan. The plan must also contain a proposal for ensuring adequate carrier-to-carrier service quality, including service quality standards or performance measures for interconnection, and appropriate enforcement or remedial provisions in the event the company fails to meet service quality standards or performance measures. The commission also may initiate consideration of alternative forms of regulation for a company or companies on its own motion. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall issue an order accepting, modifying, or rejecting the plan within nine months after the petition or motion is filed, unless extended by the commission for good cause. The commission shall order implementation of the alternative plan of regulation unless it finds that, on balance, an alternative plan as proposed or modified fails to meet the considerations stated in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not later than sixty days from the entry of the commission's order, the company or companies affected by the order may file with the commission an election not to proceed with the alternative form of regulation as authorized by the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may waive such regulatory requirements under Title 80 RCW for a telecommunications company subject to an alternative form of regulation as may be appropriate to facilitate the implementation of this section. However, the commission may not waive any grant of legal rights to any person contained in this chapter and chapter 80.04 RCW. The commission may waive different regulatory requirements for different companies or services if such different treatment is in the public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon petition by the company, and after notice and hearing, the commission may rescind or modify an alternative form of regulation in the manner requested by the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission or any person may file a complaint under RCW 80.04.110 alleging that a telecommunications company under an alternative form of regulation has not complied with the terms and conditions set forth in the alternative form of regulation. The complainant shall bear the burden of proving the allegations in the complaint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the governor may waive or suspend the operation or enforcement of this section or any portion of this section or under any administrative rule, and issue any orders to facilitate the operation of state or local government or to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature declares that the availability of an alternative abbreviated formal procedure for use by the commission instead of a full adjudicative proceeding may in appropriate circumstances advance the public interest by reducing the time required by the commission for decision and the costs incurred by interested parties and ratepayers. Therefore, the commission is authorized to use formal investigation and fact-finding instead of an adjudicative proceeding under chapter 34.05 RCW when it determines that its use is in the public interest and that a full adjudicative hearing is not necessary to fully develop the facts relevant to the proceeding and the positions of the parties, including intervenors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may use formal investigation and fact-finding instead of the hearing provided in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A complaint proceeding under RCW 80.04.110 with concurrence of the respondent when the commission is the complainant or with concurrence of the complainant and respondent when not the commission;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A tariff suspension under RCW 80.04.130; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A competitive classification proceeding under RCW 80.36.320 and 80.36.330.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In formal investigation and fact-finding the commission may limit the record to written submissions by the parties, including intervenors. The commission shall review the written submissions and, based thereon, shall enter appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law and its order. When there is a reasonable expression of public interest in the issues under consideration, the commission shall hold at least one public hearing for the receipt of information from members of the public that are not formal intervenors in the proceeding and may elect to convert the proceeding to an adjudicative proceeding at any stage. The assignment of an agency employee or administrative law judge to preside at such public hearing shall not require the entry of an initial order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall adopt rules of practice and procedure including rules for discovery of information necessary for the use of formal investigation and fact-finding and for the filing of written submissions. The commission may provide by rule for a number of rounds of written comments: PROVIDED, That the party with the burden of proof shall always have the opportunity to file reply comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a state of emergency declared under RCW 43.06.010(12), the governor may waive or suspend the operation or enforcement of this section or any portion of this section or under any administrative rule, and issue any orders to facilitate the operation of state or local government or to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population.</p>

The commission shall adopt rules that provide for the filing by telecommunications companies on the public record of the essential terms and conditions of every contract for service. The commission shall not require that customer proprietary information contained in contracts be disclosed on the public record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall not treat contracts as tariffs or price lists. The commission may require noncompetitive service to be tariffed unless the company demonstrates that the use of a contract is in the public interest based upon a customer requirement or a competitive necessity for deviation from tariffed rates, terms and conditions, or that the contract is for a new service with limited demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contracts shall be for a stated time period and shall cover the costs for the service contracted for, as determined by commission rule or order. Contracts shall be enforceable by the contracting parties according to their terms, unless the contract has been rejected by the commission before its stated effective date as improper under the commission's rules and orders, or the requirements of this chapter. If the commission finds a contract to be below cost after it has gone into effect, based on commission rules or orders or the requirements of this chapter in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, it may make the appropriate adjustment to the contracting company's revenue requirement in a subsequent proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contracts executed and filed prior to July 23, 1989, are deemed lawful and enforceable by the contracting parties according to the contract terms. If the commission finds that any existing contract provides for rates that are below cost, based on commission rules or orders or the requirements of this chapter in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, it may make the appropriate adjustment to the contracting company's revenue requirement in a subsequent proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a contract covers competitive and noncompetitive services, the noncompetitive services shall be unbundled and priced separately from all other services and facilities in the contract. Such noncompetitive services shall be made available to all purchasers under the same or substantially the same circumstances at the same rate, terms, and conditions.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that universal telephone service is an important policy goal of the state. The legislature further finds that: (a) Recent changes in the telecommunications industry, such as federal access charges, raise concerns about the ability of low-income persons to continue to afford access to local exchange telephone service; and (b) many low-income persons making the transition to independence from receiving supportive services through community agencies do not qualify for economic assistance from the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that: (a) It is in the public interest to take steps to mitigate the effects of these changes on low-income persons; and (b) advances in telecommunications technologies, such as community service voice mail provide new and economically efficient ways to secure many of the benefits of universal service to low-income persons who are not customers of local exchange telephone service.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A state universal communications services program is established. The program is established to protect public safety and welfare under the authority of the state to regulate telecommunications under Article XII, section 19 of the state Constitution. The purpose of the program is to support continued provision of basic telecommunications services under rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission and the provision, enhancement, and maintenance of broadband services, recognizing that, historically, the incumbent public network functions to provide all communications services including, but not limited to, voice and broadband services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the program, eligible communications providers may receive distributions from the universal communications services account created in RCW 80.36.690 in exchange for the affirmative agreement to provide continued telecommunications services under the rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission under this chapter, and broadband services, for the period covered by the distribution. The commission must implement and administer the program under terms and conditions established in RCW 80.36.630 through 80.36.690. Expenditures for the program may not exceed five million dollars per fiscal year; provided, however, that if less than five million dollars is expended in any fiscal year, the unexpended portion must be carried over to subsequent fiscal years and, unless fully expended, must be available for program expenditures in such subsequent fiscal years in addition to the five million dollars allotted for each of those subsequent fiscal years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A communications provider is eligible to receive distributions from the account if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The communications provider is: (A) An incumbent local exchange carrier serving fewer than forty thousand access lines in the state; or (B) a radio communications service company providing wireless two-way voice communications service and broadband services to less than the equivalent of forty thousand access lines in the state. For purposes of determining the access line threshold in this subsection, the access lines or equivalents of all wireline affiliates must be counted as a single threshold, if the lines or equivalents are located in Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The communications provider has adopted a plan to provide, enhance, or maintain broadband services in its service area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The communications provider meets any other requirements established by the commission pertaining to the provision of communications services, including basic telecommunications services; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The communications provider demonstrates to the commission that the communications provider is able to provide the same or comparable services at the same or similar service quality standards at a lower price; and: (i) Will provide communications services to all customers in the exchange or exchanges in which it will provide service; and (ii) submits to the commission's regulation of its service as if it were the incumbent local exchange company serving the exchange or exchanges for which it seeks distribution from the account.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Distributions to eligible communications providers are based on criteria established by the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the program does not have sufficient funds to fully fund the distribution formula set out in (a) of this subsection, distributions must be reduced on a pro rata basis using the amounts calculated for that year's program support as the basis of the pro rata calculations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To receive a distribution under the program, an eligible communications provider must affirmatively consent to continue providing communications services to its customers under rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission pursuant to this chapter for the period covered by the distribution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program is funded from amounts deposited by the legislature in the universal communications services account established in RCW 80.36.690. The commission must operate the program within amounts appropriated for this purpose and deposited in the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must periodically review the accounts and records of any communications provider that receives distributions under the program to ensure compliance with the program and monitor the providers' use of the funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must establish an advisory board, consisting of a reasonable balance of representatives from different types of stakeholders, including but not limited to communications providers and consumers, to advise the commission on any rules and policies governing the operation of the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program terminates on June 30, 2024, and no distributions may be made after that date.</p>

<p>Any business, resident, or community may petition for and shall receive extended area service within the service territory of the local exchange company that provides service to the petitioner under the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any customer, business or residential, interested in obtaining extended area service in their community must collect and submit to the commission the signatures of a representative majority of affected customers in the community. A &quot;representative majority&quot; for purposes of this section consists of fifteen percent of the access lines in that community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After receipt of the signatures, the commission shall authorize a study to be conducted by the affected local exchange company in order to determine whether a community of interest exists for the implementation of extended area service. For purposes of this section a community of interest shall be found if the average number of calls per customer per month from the area petitioning for extended area service to the area to which extended area service will be implemented is at least five;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a community of interest exists, the commission shall then calculate any increased rate that would be applied to the area which would have extended area service granted to it. This rate shall be based on the charges to a rate group having the same or similar calling capability as set forth in the tariffs of the local exchange telecommunications company involved;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The affected telecommunications company shall be given the opportunity to propose an alternative plan that might be priced differently and that plan shall be included in the poll of subscribers as an alternative under subsection (5) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After determining the amount of any additional rate, the commission shall notify the subscribers who will be affected by the increased rate and conduct a poll of those subscribers. If a simple majority votes its approval the commission shall order extended area service; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any extended area service program adopted pursuant to this section shall be considered experimental and not binding on the commission in subsequent extended area service proceedings. If an extended area service program adopted pursuant to this section results in a revenue deficiency for a local exchange company, the commission shall allocate the resulting revenue requirement in a manner which produces fair, just and reasonable rates for all classes of customers.</p>
