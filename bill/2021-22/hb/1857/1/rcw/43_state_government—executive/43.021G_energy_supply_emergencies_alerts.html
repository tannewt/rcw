<p>The legislature finds that energy in various forms is increasingly subject to possible shortages and supply disruptions, to the point that there may be foreseen an emergency situation, and that without the ability to institute appropriate emergency measures to regulate the production, distribution, and use of energy, a severe impact on the public health, safety, and general welfare of our state's citizens may occur. The prevention or mitigation of such energy shortages or disruptions and their effects is necessary for preservation of the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of this state.</p>
<p>It is the intent of this chapter to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Establish necessary emergency powers for the governor and define the situations under which such powers are to be exercised;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide penalties for violations of this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is further the intent of the legislature that in developing proposed orders under the powers granted in RCW 43.21G.040 as now or hereafter amended the governor may utilize, on a temporary or ad hoc basis, the knowledge and expertise of persons experienced in the technical aspects of energy supply, distribution, or use. Such utilization shall be in addition to support received by the governor from the department of <strong>commerce</strong> under RCW 43.21F.045 and 43.21F.065 and from other state agencies.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the governor shall, in developing plans for the production, allocation, and consumption of energy, give high priority to supplying vital public services including, but not limited to, essential governmental operations, public health and safety functions, emergency services, public mass transportation systems, fish production, food production and processing facilities, including the provision of water to irrigated agriculture, and energy supply facilities, during a condition of energy supply alert or energy emergency.
