<h2 id="section-1-3303">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3303">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that rates of catalytic converter theft have rapidly increased statewide and nationwide, due in part to existing challenges with accurately identifying stolen catalytic converters. The legislature further finds that victims of catalytic converter theft often incur costs that far exceed the monetary value of the catalytic converters themselves. The legislature further finds that catalytic converter theft is a multifaceted issue that requires collaborative effort between law enforcement agencies, insurance companies, scrap metal dealers, and other involved parties to identify comprehensive solutions.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to carefully examine the catalytic converter theft issues in Washington state and conduct a study to make a variety of recommendations to the legislature, including recommendations for a potential pilot program, to reduce the occurrence of catalytic converter theft. The legislature further intends to provide funding for a grant program focused on metal theft and unlawfully obtained metal.</p>
