<h2 id="section-1-3288">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3288">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that rates of catalytic converter theft have rapidly increased statewide and nationwide, due in part to existing challenges with accurately identifying stolen catalytic converters. The legislature further finds that victims of catalytic converter theft often incur costs that far exceed the monetary value of the catalytic converters themselves. The legislature further finds that catalytic converter theft is a multifaceted issue that requires collaborative effort between law enforcement agencies, insurance companies, scrap metal dealers, and other involved parties to identify comprehensive solutions.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a pilot project to mark catalytic converters with unique, permanent identifiers, thereby enabling law enforcement agencies, insurance companies, and scrap metal dealers to more effectively track the ownership of catalytic converters and identify stolen property. The legislature further intends to gather and utilize data from the pilot project to inform additional efforts to address catalytic converter theft in Washington state. The legislature further intends to establish a task force with the goal of developing effective tools and methods for deterring catalytic converter theft, identifying and recovering stolen catalytic converters, and lowering costs to victims of catalytic converter theft.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of the amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the Washington state patrol shall establish the catalytic converter tracking pilot project. The purpose of the pilot project is to deter the theft of catalytic converters by marking them with vehicle identification numbers or other unique identifiers.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Materials purchased under this pilot project may be distributed to dealers, automobile repair shops and service centers, law enforcement agencies, and community organizations to arrange for the marking of the catalytic converters of vehicles most likely to be targeted for theft at no cost to the vehicle owners. The Washington state patrol may prioritize distribution of materials to areas of Washington state experiencing the highest rates of catalytic converter theft.</p>
