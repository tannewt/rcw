<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Nearly 6,000 Washington adults and children died by suicide in the last five years, according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention, tragically reflecting a state increase of 36 percent in the last 10 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicide is now the single leading cause of death for Washington young people ages 10 through 24, with total deaths 22 percent higher than for vehicle crashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Groups with suicide rates higher than the general population include veterans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, LGBTQ youth, and people living in rural counties across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than one in five Washington residents are currently living with a behavioral health disorder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stressors and substance use among Washington residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An improved system will reduce reliance on emergency room services and the use of law enforcement response to behavioral health crises and will stabilize individuals in the community whenever possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish a coordinated crisis hotline center and crisis services system to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Save lives by improving the quality of and access to behavioral health crisis services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further equity in addressing mental health and substance use treatment and assure a culturally and linguistically competent response to behavioral health crises;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognize that, historically, crisis response placed marginalized communities, including those experiencing behavioral health crises, at disproportionate risk of poor outcomes and criminal justice involvement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with the national suicide hotline designation act of 2020 and the federal communication commission's rules adopted July 16, 2020, to assure that all Washington residents receive a consistent and effective level of 988 and crisis behavioral health services no matter where they live, work, or travel in the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide higher quality support for people experiencing behavioral health crises through investment in new technology to create a crisis call center system to triage calls and link individuals to follow-up care. Other investments include the expansion of crisis teams, to be known as mobile rapid response crisis teams, as well as a wide array of crisis stabilization services such as 23-hour crisis stabilization units based on the living room model, crisis stabilization centers, short-term respite facilities, peer-operated respite services, and behavioral health urgent care walk-in centers. The overall crisis system shall contain components that operate like hospital emergency departments that accept all walk-ins, and ambulance, fire, and police drop-offs.</p>
