<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Nearly 6,000 Washington adults and children died by suicide in the last five years, according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention, tragically reflecting a state increase of 36 percent in the last 10 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicide is now the single leading cause of death for Washington young people ages 10 through 24, with total deaths 22 percent higher than for vehicle crashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Groups with suicide rates higher than the general population include veterans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, LGBTQ youth, and people living in rural counties across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than one in five Washington residents are currently living with a behavioral health disorder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stressors and substance use among Washington residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An improved crisis response system will reduce reliance on emergency room services and the use of law enforcement response to behavioral health crises and will stabilize individuals in the community whenever possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish crisis call center hubs and expand the crisis delivery system in a deliberate, phased approach that includes the involvement of partners from a range of perspectives to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Save lives by improving the quality of and access to behavioral health crisis services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further equity in addressing mental health and substance use treatment and assure a culturally and linguistically competent response to behavioral health crises;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognize that, historically, crisis response placed marginalized communities, including those experiencing behavioral health crises, at disproportionate risk of poor outcomes and criminal justice involvement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with the national suicide hotline designation act of 2020 and the federal communication commission's rules adopted July 16, 2020, to assure that all Washington residents receive a consistent and effective level of 988 and crisis behavioral health services no matter where they live, work, or travel in the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide higher quality support for people experiencing behavioral health crises through investment in new technology to create a crisis call center hub system to triage calls and link individuals to follow-up care. Other investments include the expansion of crisis teams, to be known as mobile rapid response crisis teams, as well as a wide array of crisis stabilization services such as 23-hour crisis stabilization units based on the living room model, crisis stabilization centers, short-term respite facilities, peer-operated respite services, and behavioral health urgent care walk-in centers. The overall crisis system shall contain components that operate like hospital emergency departments that accept all walk-ins, and ambulance, fire, and police drop-offs. The use of peers must be incorporated as often as possible within the continuum of crisis care.</p>

<li>
<p>Establishing the state crisis call center hubs and crisis response system will require collaborative work between the department and the authority within their respective roles. The department shall have primary responsibility for establishing and designating the crisis call centers hubs. The authority shall have primary responsibility for developing and implementing the crisis system and services to support the work of the crisis call center hubs. In any instance in which one agency is identified as the lead, the expectation is that agency will be communicating and collaborating with the other to ensure seamless, continuous, and effective service delivery with the statewide crisis system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to July 16, 2022, the department shall provide adequate funding for an expected increase in the use of the state's crisis lifeline call centers existing as of the effective date of this section using the 988 crisis hotline. The funding level shall be established at a level anticipated to achieve an in-state call response rate of at least 90 percent and shall be determined by considering call volume predictions, cost per call predictions provided by the national suicide prevention lifeline, guidance on center performance metrics, and necessary technology upgrades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2023, the department must adopt rules to establish standards that crisis call centers must meet to be designated as crisis call center hubs by the department as of July 1, 2024. The standards must, at a minimum, address the elements identified in subsection (4) of this section. The department shall collaborate with the authority and other agencies to assure consistency in standards and policies, and utilization of services. The department shall consider recommendations from the crisis response improvement strategy committee created in section 104 of this act in implementing this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than July 1, 2024, the department shall designate crisis call center hubs to provide crisis intervention, triage, referrals, and connections to individuals accessing the 988 crisis hotline from any jurisdiction within Washington 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<p>The statewide 988 behavioral health crisis response line tax imposed by this chapter must be paid by the subscriber to the radio communications service company providing the radio access line, the local exchange company, or the interconnected voice over internet protocol service company providing the interconnected voice over internet protocol service line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each radio communications service company, each local exchange company, and each interconnected voice over internet protocol service company, must collect from the subscriber the full amount of the taxes payable. The statewide 988 behavioral health crisis response line tax required by this chapter to be collected by a company or seller, are deemed to be held in trust by the company or seller until paid to the department. Any radio communications service company, local exchange company, or interconnected voice over internet protocol service company that appropriates or converts the tax collected to its own use or to any use other than the payment of the tax to the extent that the money collected is not available for payment on the due date as prescribed in this chapter is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.</p>

<p>If any radio communications service company, local exchange company, or interconnected voice over internet protocol service company fails to collect the statewide 988 behavioral health crisis response line tax or, after collecting the tax, fails to pay it to the department in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of its own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond its control, the company or seller is personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax, unless the company or seller has taken from the buyer in good faith documentation, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, stating that the buyer is not a subscriber or consumer or is otherwise not liable for the statewide 988 behavioral health crisis response line tax.</p>

<li>
<p>The amount of tax, until paid by the subscriber to the radio communications service company, local exchange company, the interconnected voice over internet protocol service company, or to the department, constitutes a debt from the subscriber to the company, or from the consumer to the seller. Any company or seller that fails or refuses to collect the tax as required with intent to violate the provisions of this chapter or to gain some advantage or benefit, either direct or indirect, and any subscriber or consumer who refuses to pay any tax due under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor. The statewide 988 behavioral health crisis response line tax required by this chapter to be collected by the radio communications service company, local exchange company, or interconnected voice over internet protocol service company must be stated separately on the billing statement that is sent to the subscriber.</p>
</li>

<p>If a subscriber has failed to pay to the radio communications service company, local exchange company, or interconnected voice over internet protocol service company, the statewide 988 behavioral health crisis response line tax imposed by this chapter and the company or seller has not paid the amount of the tax to the department, the department may, in its discretion, proceed directly against the subscriber or consumer for collection of the tax, in which case a penalty of 10 percent may be added to the amount of the tax for failure of the subscriber or consumer to pay the tax to the company or seller, regardless of when the tax is collected by the department.</p>
