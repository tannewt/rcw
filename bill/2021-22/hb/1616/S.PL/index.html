<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.170_health_data_and_charity_care.html">70.170.020</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.170_health_data_and_charity_care.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As used in this chapter:</p>

<p>&quot;Charity care&quot; means medically necessary hospital health care rendered to indigent persons when third-party coverage, if any, has been exhausted, to the extent that the persons are unable to pay for the care or to pay deductibles or coinsurance amounts required by a third-party payer, as determined by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Indigent persons&quot; are those patients or their guarantors who qualify for charity care pursuant to section 2(5) of this act based on the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, and who have exhausted any third-party coverage.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No hospital or its medical staff shall adopt or maintain admission practices or policies which result in:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A significant reduction in the proportion of patients who have no third-party coverage and who are unable to pay for hospital services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant reduction in the proportion of individuals admitted for inpatient hospital services for which payment is, or is likely to be, less than the anticipated charges for or costs of such services; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The refusal to admit patients who would be expected to require unusually costly or prolonged treatment for reasons other than those related to the appropriateness of the care available at the hospital.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No hospital shall adopt or maintain practices or policies which would deny access to emergency care based on ability to pay. No hospital which maintains an emergency department shall transfer a patient with an emergency medical condition or who is in active labor unless the transfer is performed at the request of the patient or is due to the limited medical resources of the transferring hospital. Hospitals must follow reasonable procedures in making transfers to other hospitals including confirmation of acceptance of the transfer by the receiving hospital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop definitions by rule, as appropriate, for subsection (1) of this section and, with reference to federal requirements, subsection (2) of this section. The department shall monitor hospital compliance with subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The department shall report individual instances of possible noncompliance to the state attorney general or the appropriate federal agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish and maintain by rule, consistent with the definition of charity care in RCW 70.170.020, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Uniform procedures, data requirements, and criteria for identifying patients receiving charity care; <strong>and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A definition of residual bad debt including reasonable and uniform standards for collection procedures to be used in efforts to collect the unpaid portions of hospital charges that are the patient's responsibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of providing charity care, each hospital shall develop, implement, and maintain a  policy which shall enable <strong>indigent persons</strong> access to <strong>charity care. The policy shall include procedures for identifying patients****who may be eligible for health care coverage through medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW or the Washington health benefit exchange and actively assisting patients to apply for any available coverage. If a hospital determines that a patient or their guarantor is qualified for retroactive health care coverage through the medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW, a hospital shall assist the patient or guarantor with applying for such coverage. If a hospital determines that a patient or their guarantor qualifies for retroactive health care coverage through the medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW, a hospital is not obligated to provide charity care under this section to any patient or their guarantor if the patient or their guarantor fails to make reasonable efforts to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to assist them in applying for such coverage. Hospitals may not impose application procedures for charity care or for assistance with retroactive coverage applications which place an unreasonable burden upon the patient or guarantor, taking into account any physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory deficiencies, or language barriers which may hinder the responsible party's capability of complying with application procedures. It is an unreasonable burden to require a patient to apply for any state or federal program where the patient is obviously or categorically ineligible or has been deemed ineligible in the prior 12 months.</strong></p>

<p><strong>All patients and their guarantors whose income is between 301 and 350 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be entitled to a 75 percent discount for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges, which may be reduced by amounts reasonably related to assets considered pursuant to (c) of this subsection;</strong></p>

<p><strong>If a hospital considers the existence, availability, and value of assets in order to reduce the discount extended, it must establish and make publicly available a policy on asset considerations and corresponding discount reductions.</strong></p>

Only those facts relevant to eligibility may be verified and duplicate forms of verification may not be demanded.**

<p>(A) <strong>In considering monetary assets, one current account statement shall be considered sufficient for a hospital to verify a patient's assets.</strong></p>

<pre><code>    iv. **Asset information obtained by the hospital in evaluating a patient for charity care eligibility shall not be used for collection activities.**

v. **Nothing in this section prevents a hospital from considering assets as required by the centers for medicare and medicaid services related to medicare cost reporting.**
