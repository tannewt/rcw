<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state is in the midst of a behavioral health crisis. Unmet demand for behavioral health services is leading to negative impacts on the health and well-being of many Washingtonians. One of the many causes of this unmet demand is the inadequate number of mental health professionals available to treat Washington residents with behavioral health needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges the ongoing efforts by state agencies and stakeholders to streamline the licensing processes for certain behavioral health professionals. These efforts have, however, not yielded any meaningful increase in the number of such professionals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore intends to take action to streamline the licensing process for these professionals by reducing the number of hours of supervised experience required for full licensure, beginning July 1, 2024. The legislature intends to revisit this approach in light of any recommendations resulting from the ongoing work of state agencies and stakeholders if those recommendations are reported to the legislature prior to the 2024 regular legislative session.</p>
