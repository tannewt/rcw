<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state needs equitable and affordable outdoor recreation opportunities. Since 1990, Washington's population has grown by 2,700,000 residents. Yet, over the last 30 years, Washington's state park system has added just 28 camping sites, five vault toilets, and four composting toilets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington is expected to add another 2,200,000 residents by 2040 but has just one new state park in development that will add a meager 52 campsites. The parks and recreation commission has acquired 39 properties since 1990 and only three of those properties have been developed into parks. Currently, many state parks are fully booked in summer weekends by the previous fall. The number and geographic distribution of state parks need to be addressed considering both the pressure on some popular parks and issues of equity for communities that have experienced disproportionate environmental impacts. Therefore, the legislature intends to make changes that will address both capacity and the distribution of visitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, many state parks have maintenance issues that prevent their regular use and enjoyment. State parks are also in need of safety upgrades, including appropriate staffing by park rangers and availability of wireless communication signals for emergency communication. Therefore, the legislature intends to address the quality of the visitor experience at state parks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to improve access to enhance economic development and public health by accelerating construction of trail miles that connect communities and improving trailhead safety and conveniences, such as garbage collection and bathrooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that on-water recreation access capacity must be addressed proactively and in tandem with on-land recreational opportunities so that recreation user groups are treated fairly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the legislature finds that new fees and taxes should not be imposed to provide these needed investments. All Washingtonians will be paying directly or indirectly for the protection of the natural environment through the climate commitment act. The legislature finds that a portion of the revenue collected from that comprehensive carbon emission regulation should be invested in an overhaul of our state outdoor recreation vision and be used to eliminate existing barriers to inclusive and equitable outdoor access.</p>
