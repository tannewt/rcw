<p>The legislature finds that Washington is not on track to meet the state's educational attainment goal that at least 70 percent of adults, aged 25 to 44, have a postsecondary credential by the year 2023. Adults without a postsecondary credential are more at risk of unemployment, less likely to earn a living wage, and more vulnerable to economic downturns. The student achievement council has deemed that there are four areas essential to achieve the state's 70 percent attainment goal: Affordability, enrollment, completion, and student supports. In terms of affordability, the legislature recognizes that the Washington college grant is one of the country's largest and most generous financial aid programs. However, the legislature also recognizes that despite an increase in financial aid funding and eligibility, enrollments at institutions of higher education are down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many prospective students have made the decision to delay pursuing higher education for a myriad of reasons. However, fewer enrollments mean fewer graduates going on to work in high paying jobs, which could have a significant impact on the state's workforce and economy in the future.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to continue to work towards making higher education more affordable and accessible for the state's population by expanding the Washington college grant program. In addition, the legislature intends to provide additional support beyond tuition and fees with the recognition that many students struggle to pay for books, supplies, room and board, transportation, child care, and more while pursuing their education. Grants beyond tuition and fees can help bridge the gap for students who are struggling to pay for the entire cost of attendance at an institution of higher education, and are often the difference between a student staying enrolled and completing his or her education and dropping out. Therefore, the legislature intends to bridge the gap and support students by making postsecondary education more affordable, encouraging more enrollments, and helping students complete their credentials so tomorrow's workforce and economy are stronger.</p>
