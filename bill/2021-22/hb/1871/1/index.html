<h2 id="section-1-3401">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3401">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that more than half the state's population resides in King, Snohomish, Pierce, and Kitsap counties, yet these counties host less than two percent of all the carbon-free energy production capacity sited in Washington. The majority of voters in these four counties supported a renewable energy mandate for utilities in 2006 (Initiative 937), but they have not sited the energy called for by that mandate. In stark contrast, Columbia county is home to just .1 percent of the state's population but hosts nearly six percent of the state's carbon free energy production capacity. Similarly, Walla Walla, Franklin, and Benton county, collectively, are home to approximately 12 percent of the state's carbon free energy production capacity. Voters in these eastern Washington counties opposed the renewable energy mandate but have carbon-free energy production facilities. The legislature recognizes the local sentiment that these facilities have not brought the promised &quot;green jobs,&quot; meaningful tax revenue, or local environmental benefits in so far as these local communities were already served with clean, affordable hydroelectric energy.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to investigate possible solutions to this inequity with a goal of building a broader consensus and unity among counties on the impact of the state energy strategy. The viewshed, wildlife, and land use patterns in specific counties of the state are being permanently impacted to deliver carbon-free energy benefits to the most populous counties of the state. The legislature recognizes that the burden of siting large carbon-free energy projects has been deeply inequitable and, in many cases, sharply divisive for neighbors and communities and not in keeping with locally developed visions for growth and economic development.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to impose a short-term moratorium on alternative energy facility siting approvals that bypass the local siting process. During the moratorium, the legislature intends for a joint legislative task force to convene and examine the equity between carbon-free energy producing counties and the counties of highest energy consumption, both at baseline present conditions and as it is likely to unfold under the state's deep decarbonization energy strategy.</p>
<p>The equity review that the task force engages in should recognize the full value to the state and its economic development of the many decades of carbon-free, affordable energy provided by the counties that have sited hydroelectric energy and the transmission capacity that brings it to Washington's most populous counties.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for the task force to study how the state's deep decarbonization energy strategy will impact the environment, viewsheds, employment, and tax base of various counties as new transmission lines and energy facilities are sited to meet our state statutory goals.</p>
<p>The legislature intends for the task force to examine whether mitigation payments, viewshed impairment payments, or supplemental economic development assistance to producer counties would improve equity and environmental justice by compensating appropriately for the imbalance in local impacts between producer counties and consumer counties that has existed and may worsen with the state energy strategy if not addressed.</p>

<p>An assessment of the beneficial impact of the energy independence act on Washington's fuel mix. This must include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An assessment, as of 2020, of the percentage of Washington's electric fuel mix that derives from the renewable energy resources promised and promoted by the energy independence act; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The calculation of the cumulative expenditures between 2006 and 2020 by each electric utility subject to the provisions of chapter 19.285 RCW on compliance costs related to the energy independence act, with cumulative expenditures by each utility specific to each of the following categories of expenditure caused by compliance obligations under chapter 19.285 RCW:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) The use of renewable energy resources;</p>
<p>(B) The purchase of renewable energy credits; and</p>
<p>(C) The requirement to spend four percent of retail revenues on renewable resources;</p>
<pre><code>b. An assessment of the capital expenditures in each county in Washington on renewable resources in each year between 2006 and 2020;

c. [Empty]

    i. An assessment of the impacts on the state and local tax revenue collections and the property tax base in each county in each year between 2006 and 2020 associated with the expenditures specified in (b) of this subsection;

    ii. An assessment of the impacts on sources of revenues dedicated to local school districts, including impacts, if any, on state local effort assistance funding, for each year between 2006 and 2020 associated with the expenditures specified in (b) of this subsection;

d. An identification of the number and type of jobs created in each county in Washington as a result of the implementation of chapter 19.285 RCW between 2006 and 2020. Each of the jobs counted under this subsection must be categorized as belonging to at least one of the following categories:

    i. Short-term construction jobs;

    ii. Long-term jobs that outlast facility construction;

    iii. Regulatory or compliance jobs created at state agencies, electric utilities, or local governments; and

    iv. Jobs related to the production or marketing of electricity from a new renewable energy resource;

e. A calculation of the cumulative incremental cost to each electric utility, and in aggregate for all electric utilities in Washington, above the least cost wholesale energy resource, between 2006 and 2020, of utility compliance with the targets established in RCW 19.285.040(2);

f. A calculation of the incremental cost of renewable resources eligible under chapter 19.285 RCW, including wind and solar, relative to other nongreenhouse gas emitting energy resources, such as electricity derived from nuclear or hydroelectric facilities. This incremental cost calculation must be measured based on the average wholesale market price of electricity from nongreenhouse gas emitting energy resources between 2006 and 2020; and

g. A generalized description and map of the areas of Washington that electric utilities consider to have available resources for potentially economical utility-scale wind or solar energy facility development.
