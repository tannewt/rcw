<p>According to a recent study of provisional data collected by the United States centers for disease control and prevention, overdose from fentanyl is now the leading cause of death of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Washington is not immune from the opioid epidemic. Fentanyl has had a staggering effect on its communities, and fentanyl-related overdoses are increasing across the state. Under current law, possession of fentanyl is classified as a simple misdemeanor, which is the lowest criminal penalty available. This is an insufficient criminal justice system response to this extremely dangerous drug. The legislature intends to restore the former felony penalties for possession of fentanyl in order to reflect the extreme hazards associated with this highly potent substance, and additionally intends to launch a public outreach campaign to enhance public education on this issue and connect affected individuals with available resources.</p>

<p>NOTE: References in the grid to days or weeks mean periods of confinement. &quot;LS&quot; means &quot;local sanctions&quot; as defined in RCW 13.40.020.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Evidence-based&quot; means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Research-based&quot; means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of an A+ or A++ offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is <strong>14</strong> years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A class A offense, or an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit a class A offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manslaughter in the first degree (RCW 9A.32.060);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assault in the second degree (RCW 9A.36.021), extortion in the first degree (RCW 9A.56.120), kidnapping in the second degree (RCW 9A.40.030), drive-by shooting (RCW 9A.36.045), vehicular homicide (RCW 46.61.520), hit and run death (RCW 46.52.020(4)(a)), or manslaughter 2 (RCW 9A.32.070); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of the uniform controlled substances act (RCW 69.50.401(2) (a) and (b)), when the offense includes infliction of bodily harm upon another or when during the commission or immediate withdrawal from the offense the respondent was armed with a deadly weapon;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is ordered to serve a disposition for a firearm violation under RCW 13.40.193;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a prior option B disposition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed a B++ or B+ offense, the court may impose a disposition under RCW 13.40.160(4) and 13.40.165.</p>
<p>If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).</p>
<h2 id="section-6-1172">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-1172">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department of health shall develop and execute a public outreach campaign to educate the public about the dangers of consuming fentanyl and to provide information about available resources. The campaign must focus on both prevention and response, and must include multiple outreach strategies, such as brochures, public service announcements, social media postings, and other education and training efforts as the department of health deems appropriate.</p>
