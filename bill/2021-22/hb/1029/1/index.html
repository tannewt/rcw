<h2 id="section-1-2262">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2262">¶</a></h2>
<p>The state Constitution declares that all political power is inherent in the people, and governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and are established to protect and maintain individual rights. The Constitution further declares that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, and the right of petition and of the people peaceably to assemble for the common good shall never be abridged. Therefore, the legislature intends to protect the rights of the people by limiting and constraining the governor's power and scope of authority in the event of an emergency by ensuring proclamations of emergency are subject to judicial review and requiring legislative action to extend any proclamation.</p>

<p>The proclamation of a state of emergency and other proclamations or orders issued by the governor pursuant to RCW 43.06.010, and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270 as now or hereafter amended shall be in writing and shall be signed by the governor and shall then be filed with the secretary of state. A proclamation of a state of emergency is effective upon the governor's signature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A proclamation of a state of emergency must identify the area of the state in which the emergency exists. Such area may not exceed a single county in any single proclamation. The governor may issue multiple proclamations intended to address simultaneous emergencies in multiple counties, even where those simultaneous emergencies arise from the same facts constituting an emergency.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A proclamation of a state of emergency must identify the specific facts giving rise to the emergency in the area covered by that proclamation and the specific facts under which order will be determined to have been restored in the area affected. Facts giving rise to an emergency may not include circumstances addressed in existing statutes or regulations.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governor shall give as much public notice as practical through the news media of the issuance of proclamations or orders pursuant to RCW 43.06.010, and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270 as now or hereafter amended.</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> issuance of a proclamation of the governor declaring its termination: PROVIDED, That the governor must terminate said state of emergency proclamation when order has been restored in the area affected**; or**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>14 days after a proclamation of a state of emergency is signed by the governor unless extended by the legislature through concurrent resolution. If the legislature is not in session, the state of emergency may be extended in writing by the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives until the legislature can extend the state of emergency by concurrent resolution. No individual extension may exceed 14 days. The legislature may pass subsequent resolutions of extension. For purposes of this section, &quot;leadership of the senate and the house of representatives&quot; means the majority and minority leaders of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Any person may seek judicial review in the superior court of the county subject to an emergency proclamation to determine whether the facts identified in a proclamation as constituting an emergency constitute a circumstance addressed in existing law. Such judicial determination constitutes a determination that the proclamation of emergency is void</strong>.</p>

<p>Such other statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to legislative leadership and impacted local governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g).</p>

<p>That immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest;</p>

<p>the agency may dispense with those requirements and adopt, amend, or repeal the rule on an emergency basis.

<p>An emergency rule adopted under this section takes effect upon filing with the code reviser, unless a later date is specified in the order of adoption, and may not remain in effect for longer than one hundred twenty days after filing. <strong>An emergency rule adopted during a state of emergency proclaimed under RCW 43.06.210 may not remain in effect for longer than 30 days after the state of emergency ceases to exist.</strong> Identical or substantially similar emergency rules may not be adopted in sequence unless conditions have changed or the agency has filed notice of its intent to adopt the rule as a permanent rule, and is actively undertaking the appropriate procedures to adopt the rule as a permanent rule. This section does not relieve any agency from compliance with any law requiring that its permanent rules be approved by designated persons or bodies before they become effective.</p>

<li>
<p>Within seven days after the rule is adopted, any person may petition the governor requesting the immediate repeal of a rule adopted on an emergency basis by any department listed in RCW 43.17.010.

In ruling on the petition, the governor shall consider only whether the conditions in subsection (1) of this section were met such that adoption of the rule on an emergency basis was necessary. If the governor orders the repeal of the emergency rule, any sanction imposed based on that rule is void. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit adoption of any rule as a permanent rule.</p>
