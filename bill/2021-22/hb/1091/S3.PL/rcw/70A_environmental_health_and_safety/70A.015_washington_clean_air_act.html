<p>It is declared to be the public policy to preserve, protect, and enhance the air quality for current and future generations. Air is an essential resource that must be protected from harmful levels of pollution. Improving air quality is a matter of statewide concern and is in the public interest. It is the intent of this chapter to secure and maintain levels of air quality that protect human health and safety, including the most sensitive members of the population, to comply with the requirements of the federal clean air act, to prevent injury to plant, animal life, and property, to foster the comfort and convenience of Washington's inhabitants, to promote the economic and social development of the state, and to facilitate the enjoyment of the natural attractions of the state.</p>
<p>It is further the intent of this chapter to protect the public welfare, to preserve visibility, to protect scenic, aesthetic, historic, and cultural values, and to prevent air pollution problems that interfere with the enjoyment of life, property, or natural attractions.</p>
<p>Because of the extent of the air pollution problem the legislature finds it necessary to return areas with poor air quality to levels adequate to protect health and the environment as expeditiously as possible but no later than December 31, 1995. Further, it is the intent of this chapter to prevent any areas of the state with acceptable air quality from reaching air contaminant levels that are not protective of human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that air pollution control projects may affect other environmental media. In selecting air pollution control strategies state and local agencies shall support those strategies that lessen the negative environmental impact of the project on all environmental media, including air, water, and land.</p>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that energy efficiency and energy conservation can help to reduce air pollution and shall therefore be considered when making decisions on air pollution control strategies and projects.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the state that the costs of protecting the air resource and operating state and local air pollution control programs shall be shared as equitably as possible among all sources whose emissions cause air pollution.</p>
<p>It is also declared as public policy that regional air pollution control programs are to be encouraged and supported to the extent practicable as essential instruments for the securing and maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality.</p>
<p>To these ends it is the purpose of this chapter to safeguard the public interest through an intensive, progressive, and coordinated statewide program of air pollution prevention and control, to provide for an appropriate distribution of responsibilities, and to encourage coordination and cooperation between the state, regional, and local units of government, to improve cooperation between state and federal government, public and private organizations, and the concerned individual, as well as to provide for the use of all known, available, and reasonable methods to reduce, prevent, and control air pollution.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the problems and effects of air pollution cross political boundaries, are frequently regional or interjurisdictional in nature, and are dependent upon the existence of human activity in areas having common topography and weather conditions conducive to the buildup of air contaminants. In addition, the legislature recognizes that air pollution levels are aggravated and compounded by increased population, and its consequences. These changes often result in increasingly serious problems for the public and the environment.</p>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that air emissions from thousands of small individual sources are major contributors to air pollution in many regions of the state. As the population of a region grows, small sources may contribute an increasing proportion of that region's total air emissions. It is declared to be the policy of the state to achieve significant reductions in emissions from those small sources whose aggregate emissions constitute a significant contribution to air pollution in a particular region.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that air pollution goals be incorporated in the missions and actions of state agencies.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The cost-reimbursement agreement shall identify the tasks and costs for work to be conducted under the agreement. The agreement must include a schedule that states:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The estimated number of weeks for initial review of the permit application;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The estimated number of revision cycles;</p>

<li>
<p>A date for revision of the agreement if necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The written cost-reimbursement agreement shall be negotiated with the permit applicant or project proponent. Under the provisions of a cost-reimbursement agreement, funds from the applicant or proponent shall be used by the air pollution control authority to contract with an independent consultant to carry out the work covered by the cost-reimbursement agreement. The air pollution control authority may also use funds provided under a cost-reimbursement agreement to hire temporary employees, to assign current staff to review the work of the consultant, to provide necessary technical assistance when an independent consultant with comparable technical skills is unavailable, and to recover reasonable and necessary direct and indirect costs that arise from processing the permit. The air pollution control authority shall, in developing the agreement, ensure that final decisions that involve policy matters are made by the agency and not by the consultant. The air pollution control authority shall make an estimate of the number of permanent staff hours to process the permits, and shall contract with consultants or hire temporary employees to replace the time and functions committed by these permanent staff to the project. The billing process shall provide for accurate time and cost accounting and may include a billing cycle that provides for progress payments.</p>

<li>
<p>The cost-reimbursement agreement must not negatively impact the processing of other permit applications. In order to maintain permit processing capacity, the agency may hire outside consultants, temporary employees, or make internal administrative changes. Consultants or temporary employees hired as part of a cost-reimbursement agreement or to maintain agency capacity are hired as agents of the state not of the permit applicant. The provisions of chapter 42.52 RCW apply to any cost-reimbursement agreement, and to any person hired as a result of a cost-reimbursement agreement. Members of the air pollution control authority's board of directors shall be considered as state officers, and employees of the air pollution control authority shall be considered as state employees, for the sole purpose of applying the restrictions of chapter 42.52 RCW to this section.</p>

<p>The department of ecology or board of any authority may require notice of the establishment of any proposed new sources except single-family and duplex dwellings or de minimis new sources as defined in rules adopted under subsection (11) of this section. The department of ecology or board may require such notice to be accompanied by a fee and determine the amount of such fee: PROVIDED, That the amount of the fee may not exceed the cost of reviewing the plans, specifications, and other information and administering such notice: PROVIDED FURTHER, That any such notice given or notice of construction application submitted to either the board or to the department of ecology shall preclude a further submittal of a duplicate application to any board or to the department of ecology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall, after opportunity for public review and comment, adopt rules that establish a workload-driven process for determination and review of the fee covering the direct and indirect costs of processing a notice of construction application and a methodology for tracking revenues and expenditures. All new source fees collected by the delegated local air authorities from sources shall be deposited in the dedicated accounts of their respective treasuries. All new source fees collected by the department from sources shall be deposited in the air pollution control account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days of receipt of a notice of construction application, the department of ecology or board may require, as a condition precedent to the establishment of the new source or sources covered thereby, the submission of plans, specifications, and such other information as it deems necessary to determine whether the proposed new source will be in accord with applicable rules and regulations in force under this chapter. If on the basis of plans, specifications, or other information required under this section the department of ecology or board determines that the proposed new source will not be in accord with this chapter or the applicable ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations adopted under this chapter, it shall issue an order denying permission to establish the new source. If on the basis of plans, specifications, or other information required under this section, the department of ecology or board determines that the proposed new source will be in accord with this chapter, and the applicable rules and regulations adopted under this chapter, it shall issue an order of approval for the establishment of the new source or sources, which order may provide such conditions as are reasonably necessary to assure the maintenance of compliance with this chapter and the applicable rules and regulations adopted under this chapter. Every order of approval under this chapter must be reviewed prior to issuance by a professional engineer or staff under the supervision of a professional engineer in the employ of the department of ecology or board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The determination required under subsection (3) of this section shall include a determination of whether the operation of the new air contaminant source at the location proposed will cause any ambient air quality standard to be exceeded.</p>

<p>New source review of a modification shall be limited to the emission unit or units proposed to be modified and the air contaminants whose emissions would increase as a result of the modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the department of ecology or board to require the use of emission control equipment or other equipment, machinery, or devices of any particular type, from any particular supplier, or produced by any particular manufacturer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any features, machines, and devices constituting parts of or called for by plans, specifications, or other information submitted pursuant to subsection (1) or (3) of this section shall be maintained and operate in good working order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The absence of an ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation, or the failure to issue an order pursuant to this section shall not relieve any person from his or her obligation to comply with applicable emission control requirements or with any other provision of law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within thirty days of receipt of a notice of construction application the department of ecology or board shall either notify the applicant in writing that the application is complete or notify the applicant in writing of all additional information necessary to complete the application. Within sixty days of receipt of a complete application the department or board shall either (a) issue a final decision on the application, or (b) for those projects subject to public notice, initiate notice and comment on a proposed decision, followed as promptly as possible by a final decision. A person seeking approval to construct or modify a source that requires an operating permit may elect to integrate review of the operating permit application or amendment required by RCW 70A.15.2260 and the notice of construction application required by this section. A notice of construction application designated for integrated review shall be processed in accordance with operating permit program procedures and deadlines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A notice of construction approval required under subsection (3) of this section shall include a determination that the new source will achieve best available control technology. If more stringent controls are required under federal law, the notice of construction shall include a determination that the new source will achieve the more stringent federal requirements. Nothing in this subsection is intended to diminish other state authorities under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person is required to submit a notice of construction or receive approval for a new source that is deemed by the department of ecology or board to have de minimis impact on air quality. The department of ecology shall adopt and periodically update rules identifying categories of de minimis new sources. The department of ecology may identify de minimis new sources by category, size, or emission thresholds.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>By January 1, 1994, ecology shall develop a list of sources and source categories requiring RACT review and a schedule for conducting that review. Ecology shall review the list and schedule within six months of receiving the initial operating permit applications and at least once every five years thereafter. In developing the list to determine the schedule of RACT review, ecology shall consider emission reductions achievable through the use of new available technologies and the impacts of those incremental reductions on air quality, the remaining useful life of previously installed control equipment, the impact of the source or source category on air quality, the number of years since the last BACT, RACT, or LAER determination for that source and other relevant factors. Prior to finalizing the list and schedule, ecology shall consult with local air authorities, the regulated community, environmental groups, and other interested individuals and organizations. The department and local authorities shall revise RACT requirements, as needed, based on the review conducted under this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining RACT, ecology and local authorities shall utilize the factors set forth in RCW 70A.15.1030 and shall consider RACT determinations and guidance made by the federal environmental protection agency, other states and local authorities for similar sources, and other relevant factors.

<li>
<p>The department and local air authorities are authorized to assess and collect a fee to cover the costs of developing, establishing, or reviewing categorical or case-by-case RACT requirements. The fee shall apply to determinations of RACT requirements as defined under this section and RCW 70A.15.3000(9). The amount of the fee may not exceed the direct and indirect costs of establishing the requirement for the particular source or the pro rata portion of the direct and indirect costs of establishing the requirement for the relevant source category.

<li>
<p>As used in subsection (3) of this section, the term &quot;bubble&quot; means an air pollution control system which permits aggregate measurements of allowable emissions, for a single category of pollutant, for emissions points from a specified emissions-generating facility or facilities. Individual point source emissions levels from such specified facility or facilities may be modified provided that the aggregate limit for the specified sources is not exceeded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever any regulation relating to emission standards or other requirements for the control of emissions is adopted which provides for compliance with such standards or requirements no later than a specified time after the date of adoption of the regulation, the appropriate activated air pollution control authority or, if there be none, the department of ecology shall, by permit or regulatory order, issue to air contaminant sources subject to the standards or requirements, schedules of compliance setting forth timetables for the achievement of compliance as expeditiously as practicable, but in no case later than the time specified in the regulation. Interim dates in such schedules for the completion of steps of progress toward compliance shall be as enforceable as the final date for full compliance therein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wherever requirements necessary for the attainment of air quality standards or, where such standards are not exceeded, for the maintenance of air quality can be achieved through the use of a control program involving the bubble concept, such program may be authorized by a regulatory order or orders or permit issued to the air contaminant source or sources involved. Such order or permit shall only be authorized after the control program involving the bubble concept is accepted by [the] United States environmental protection agency as part of an approved state implementation plan. Any such order or permit provision shall restrict total emissions within the bubble to no more than would otherwise be allowed in the aggregate for all emitting processes covered. The orders or permits provided for by this subsection shall be issued by the department or the authority with jurisdiction. If the bubble involves interjurisdictional approval, concurrence in the total program must be secured from each regulatory entity concerned.</p>

<li>
<p>Rules establishing the elements for a statewide operating permit program and the process for permit application and renewal consistent with federal requirements shall be established by the department by January 1, 1993. The rules shall provide that every proposed permit must be reviewed prior to issuance by a professional engineer or staff under the direct supervision of a professional engineer in the employ of the permitting authority. The permit program established by these rules shall be administered by the department and delegated local air authorities. Rules developed under this subsection shall not preclude a delegated local air authority from including in a permit its own more stringent emission standards and operating restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board of any local air pollution control authority may apply to the department of ecology for a delegation order authorizing the local authority to administer the operating permit program for sources under that authority's jurisdiction. The department shall, by order, approve such delegation, if the department finds that the local authority has the technical and financial resources, to discharge the responsibilities of a permitting authority under the federal clean air act. A delegation request shall include adequate information about the local authority's resources to enable the department to make the findings required by this subsection. However, any delegation order issued under this subsection shall take effect ninety days after the environmental protection agency authorizes the local authority to issue operating permits under the federal clean air act.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Operating permits shall apply to all sources (a) where required by the federal clean air act, and (b) for any source that may cause or contribute to air pollution in such quantity as to create a threat to the public health or welfare. Subsection (b) of this subsection is not intended to apply to small businesses except when both of the following limitations are satisfied: (i) The source is in an area exceeding or threatening to exceed federal or state air quality standards; and (ii) the department provides a reasonable justification that requiring a source to have a permit is necessary to meet a federal or state air quality standard, or to prevent exceeding a standard in an area threatening to exceed the standard. For purposes of this subsection &quot;areas threatening to exceed air quality standards&quot; shall mean areas projected by the department to exceed such standards within five years. Prior to identifying threatened areas the department shall hold a public hearing or hearings within the proposed areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sources operated by government agencies are not exempt under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within one hundred eighty days after the United States environmental protection agency approves the state operating permit program, a person required to have a permit shall submit to the permitting authority a compliance plan and permit application, signed by a responsible official, certifying the accuracy of the information submitted. Until permits are issued, existing sources shall be allowed to operate under presently applicable standards and conditions provided that such sources submit complete and timely permit applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All draft permits shall be subject to public notice and comment. The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall specify procedures for public notice and comment. Such procedures shall provide the permitting agency with an opportunity to respond to comments received from interested parties prior to the time that the proposed permit is submitted to the environmental protection agency for review pursuant to section 505(a) of the federal clean air act. In the event that the environmental protection agency objects to a proposed permit pursuant to section 505(b) of the federal clean air act, the permitting authority shall not issue the permit, unless the permittee consents to the changes required by the environmental protection agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedures contained in chapter 43.21B RCW shall apply to permit appeals. The pollution control hearings board may stay the effectiveness of any permit issued under this section during the pendency of an appeal filed by the permittee, if the permittee demonstrates that compliance with the permit during the pendency of the appeal would require significant expenditures that would not be necessary in the event that the permittee prevailed on the merits of the appeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the effective date of any permit program promulgated under this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to: (a) Operate a permitted source in violation of any requirement of a permit issued under this section; or (b) fail to submit a permit application at the time required by rules adopted under subsection (2) of this section.</p>

<p>The responsibility for operating permit fee determination, assessment, and collection is to be shared by the department and delegated local air authorities as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each permitting authority, including the department, acting in its capacity as a permitting authority, shall develop a fee schedule and mechanism for collecting fees from the permit program sources under its jurisdiction; the fees collected by each authority shall be sufficient to cover its costs of permit administration and its share of the department's costs of development and oversight. Each delegated local authority shall remit to the department its share of the department's development and oversight costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only those local air authorities to whom the department has delegated the authority to administer the program pursuant to RCW 70A.15.2260(2) (b) and (c) and 70A.15.6240 shall have the authority to administer and collect operating permit fees. The department shall retain the authority to administer and collect such fees with respect to the sources within the jurisdiction of a local air authority until the effective date of program delegation to that air authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall allocate its development and oversight costs among all permitting authorities, including the department, in proportion to the number of permit program sources under the jurisdiction of each authority, except that extraordinary costs or other costs readily attributable to a specific permitting authority may be assessed that authority. For purposes of this subsection, all sources covered by a single general permit shall be treated as one source.</p>

<li>
<p>The department and each delegated local air authority shall adopt by rule a general permit fee schedule for sources under their respective jurisdictions after such time as the department adopts provisions for general permit issuance. Within ninety days of the time that the department adopts a general permit fee schedule, the department shall report to the relevant standing committees of the legislature regarding the general permit fee schedules adopted by the department and by the delegated local air authorities. The permit administration costs of each general permit shall be allocated equitably among only those sources subject to that general permit. The share of development and oversight costs attributable to each general permit shall be determined pursuant to subsection (3)(c) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fee schedule developed by the department shall allocate among the sources for whom the department acts as a permitting authority, other than sources subject to a general permit, those portions of the department's permit administration costs and the department's share of the development and oversight costs which the department does not plan to recover under its general permit fee schedule or schedules as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department shall allocate its permit administration costs and its share of the development and oversight costs not recovered through general permit fees according to a three-tiered model based upon:</p>

<p>The department shall prepare a biennial budget based upon the resource requirements identified in the workload analysis for that biennium. In preparing the budget, the department shall take into account the projected operating permit account balance at the start of the biennium. The department shall provide the opportunity for public review of and comment on the proposed budget. The department shall review and update its budget each biennium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop a fee schedule allocating the department's permit administration costs and its share of the development and oversight costs among the department's permit program sources using the methodology described in subsection (5) of this section. The department shall provide the opportunity for public review of and comment on the allocation methodology and fee schedule. The department shall provide procedures for administrative resolution of disputes regarding the source data on which allocation determinations are based; these procedures shall be designed such that resolution occurs prior to the completion of the allocation process. The department shall review and update its fee schedule annually.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The methodology for tracking revenues and expenditures shall include the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The department shall develop a system for tracking revenues and expenditures that provides the maximum practicable information. At a minimum, revenues from fees collected under the operating permit program shall be tracked on a source-specific basis and time and expenditures required to administer the program shall be tracked on the basis of source categories and functional categories. Each general permit will be treated as a separate source category for tracking and accounting purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall use the information obtained from tracking revenues, time, and expenditures to modify the workload analysis required in subsection (6)(a) of this section.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Each local air authority requesting delegation shall, after opportunity for public review and comment, publish regulations which establish a process for development and review of its operating permit program fee schedule, and a methodology for tracking its revenues and expenditures. These regulations shall be submitted to the department for review and approval as part of the local authority's delegation request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section and in RCW 70A.15.2260(14), &quot;regulated pollutant&quot; shall have the same meaning as defined in section 502(b) of the federal clean air act as it exists on July 25, 1993, or its later enactment as adopted by reference by the director by rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fee structures as authorized under this section shall remain in effect until such time as the legislature authorizes an alternative structure following receipt of the report required by this subsection.</p>

<li>
<p>Any person who owns or is in control of any plant, building, structure, establishment, process or equipment may apply to the department of ecology or appropriate local authority board for a variance from rules or regulations governing the quality, nature, duration or extent of discharges of air contaminants. The application shall be accompanied by such information and data as the department of ecology or board may require. The department of ecology or board may grant such variance, provided that variances to state rules shall require the department's approval prior to being issued by a local authority board. The total time period for a variance and renewal of such variance shall not exceed one year. Variances may be issued by either the department or a local board but only after public hearing or due notice, if the department or board finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The emissions occurring or proposed to occur do not endanger public health or safety or the environment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance with the rules or regulations from which variance is sought would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No variance shall be granted pursuant to this section until the department of ecology or board has considered the relative interests of the applicant, other owners of property likely to be affected by the discharges, and the general public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any variance or renewal thereof shall be granted within the requirements of subsection (1) of this section and under conditions consistent with the reasons therefor, and within the following limitations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the variance is granted on the ground that there is no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, abatement or control of the pollution involved, it shall be only until the necessary means for prevention, abatement or control become known and available, and subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the department of ecology or board may prescribe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the variance is granted on the ground that compliance with the particular requirement or requirements from which variance is sought will require the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a period not to exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the department of ecology or board is requisite for the taking of the necessary measures. A variance granted on the ground specified herein shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to such timetable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the variance is granted on the ground that it is justified to relieve or prevent hardship of a kind other than that provided for in (a) and (b) of this subsection, it shall be for not more than one year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed on terms and conditions and for periods which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance. If complaint is made to the department of ecology or board on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be granted unless following a public hearing on the complaint on due notice the department or board finds that renewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least sixty days prior to the expiration of the variance. Immediately upon receipt of an application for renewal, the department of ecology or board shall give public notice of such application in accordance with rules of the department of ecology or board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A variance or renewal shall not be a right of the applicant or holder thereof but shall be granted at the discretion of the department of ecology or board. However, any applicant adversely affected by the denial or the terms and conditions of the granting of an application for a variance or renewal of a variance by the department of ecology or board may obtain judicial review thereof under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW as now or hereafter amended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section and no variance or renewal granted pursuant hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the emergency provisions and procedures of RCW 70A.15.6000 through 70A.15.6040 to any person or his or her property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application for a variance, or for the renewal thereof, submitted to the department of ecology or board pursuant to this section shall be approved or disapproved by the department or board within sixty-five days of receipt unless the applicant and the department of ecology or board agree to a continuance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variances approved under this section shall not be included in orders or permits provided for in RCW 70A.15.2260 or 70A.15.2210 until such time as the variance has been accepted by the United States environmental protection agency as part of an approved state implementation plan.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall have all the powers as provided in RCW 70A.15.2040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in addition to any other powers vested in it by law after consideration at a public hearing held in accordance with chapters 42.30 and 34.05 RCW shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Adopt rules establishing air quality objectives and air quality standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt emission standards which shall constitute minimum emission standards throughout the state. An authority may enact more stringent emission standards, except for emission performance standards for new woodstoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices which shall be statewide, but in no event may less stringent standards be enacted by an authority without the prior approval of the department after public hearing and due notice to interested parties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt by rule air quality standards and emission standards for the control or prohibition of emissions to the outdoor atmosphere of radionuclides, dust, fumes, mist, smoke, other particulate matter, vapor, gas, odorous substances, or any combination thereof. Such requirements may be based upon a system of classification by types of emissions or types of sources of emissions, or combinations thereof, which it determines most feasible for the purposes of this chapter. However, an industry, or the air pollution control authority having jurisdiction, can choose, subject to the submittal of appropriate data that the industry has quantified, to have any limit on the opacity of emissions from a source whose emission standard is stated in terms of a weight of particulate per unit volume of air (e.g., grains per dry standard cubic foot) be based on the applicable particulate emission standard for that source, such that any violation of the opacity limit accurately indicates a violation of the applicable particulate emission standard. Any alternative opacity limit provided by this section that would result in increasing air contaminants emissions in any nonattainment area shall only be granted if equal or greater emission reductions are provided for by the same source obtaining the revised opacity limit. A reasonable fee may be assessed to the industry to which the alternate opacity standard would apply. The fee shall cover only those costs to the air pollution control authority which are directly related to the determination on the acceptability of the alternate opacity standard, including testing, oversight and review of data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The air quality standards and emission standards may be for the state as a whole or may vary from area to area or source to source, except that emission performance standards for new woodstoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices shall be statewide, as may be appropriate to facilitate the accomplishment of the objectives of this chapter and to take necessary or desirable account of varying local conditions of population concentration, the existence of actual or reasonably foreseeable air pollution, topographic and meteorologic conditions and other pertinent variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is directed to cooperate with the appropriate agencies of the United States or other states or any interstate agencies or international agencies with respect to the control of air pollution and air contamination, or for the formulation for the submission to the legislature of interstate air pollution control compacts or agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is directed to conduct or cause to be conducted a continuous surveillance program to monitor the quality of the ambient atmosphere as to concentrations and movements of air contaminants and conduct or cause to be conducted a program to determine the quantity of emissions to the atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall enforce the air quality standards and emission standards throughout the state except where a local authority is enforcing the state regulations or its own regulations which are more stringent than those of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall encourage local units of government to handle air pollution problems within their respective jurisdictions; and, on a cooperative basis provide technical and consultative assistance therefor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall have the power to require the addition to or deletion of a county or counties from an existing authority in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter. No such addition or deletion shall be made without the concurrence of any existing authority involved. Such action shall only be taken after a public hearing held pursuant to the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish rules requiring sources or source categories to apply reasonable and available control methods. Such rules shall apply to those sources or source categories that individually or collectively contribute the majority of statewide air emissions of each regulated pollutant. The department shall review, and if necessary, update its rules every five years to ensure consistency with current reasonable and available control methods. The department shall have adopted rules required under this subsection for all sources by July 1, 1996.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;reasonable and available control methods&quot; shall include but not be limited to, changes in technology, processes, or other control strategies.</p>

<p>If the department finds, after public hearing upon due notice to all interested parties, that the emissions from a particular type or class of air contaminant source should be regulated on a statewide basis in the public interest and for the protection of the welfare of the citizens of the state, it may adopt and enforce rules to control and/or prevent the emission of air contaminants from such source. An authority may, after public hearing and a finding by the board of a need for more stringent rules than those adopted by the department under this section, propose the adoption of such rules by the department for the control of emissions from the particular type or class of air contaminant source within the geographical area of the authority. The department shall hold a public hearing and shall adopt the proposed rules within the area of the requesting authority, unless it finds that the proposed rules are inconsistent with the rules adopted by the department under this section. When such standards are adopted by the department it shall delegate solely to the requesting authority all powers necessary for their enforcement at the request of the authority. If after public hearing the department finds that the regulation on a statewide basis of a particular type or class of air contaminant source is no longer required for the public interest and the protection of the welfare of the citizens of the state, the department may relinquish exclusive jurisdiction over such source.</p>

<p>In the interest of the public health and welfare and in keeping with the objectives of RCW 70A.15.1005, the legislature declares it to be the public policy of the state to control, reduce, and prevent air pollution caused by woodstove emissions. It is the state's policy to reduce woodstove emissions by encouraging the department of ecology to continue efforts to educate the public about the effects of woodstove emissions, other heating alternatives, and the desirability of achieving better emission performance and heating efficiency from woodstoves. The legislature further declares that: (1) The purchase of certified woodstoves will not solve the problem of pollution caused by woodstove emissions; and (2) the reduction of air pollution caused by woodstove emissions will only occur when woodstove users adopt proper methods of wood burning.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that automotive traffic in Washington's metropolitan areas is the major source of emissions of air contaminants. This air pollution causes significant harm to public health, causes damage to trees, plants, structures, and materials and degrades the quality of the environment.</p>
<p>Increasing automotive traffic is also aggravating traffic congestion in Washington's metropolitan areas. This traffic congestion imposes significant costs on Washington's businesses, governmental agencies, and individuals in terms of lost working hours and delays in the delivery of goods and services. Traffic congestion worsens automobile-related air pollution, increases the consumption of fuel, and degrades the habitability of many of Washington's cities and suburban areas. The capital and environmental costs of fully accommodating the existing and projected automobile traffic on roads and highways are prohibitive. Decreasing the demand for vehicle trips is significantly less costly and at least as effective in reducing traffic congestion and its impacts as constructing new transportation facilities such as roads and bridges, to accommodate increased traffic volumes.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that increasing automotive transportation is a major factor in increasing consumption of gasoline and, thereby, increasing reliance on imported sources of petroleum. Moderating the growth in automotive travel is essential to stabilizing and reducing dependence on imported petroleum and improving the nation's energy security.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that reducing the number of commute trips to work made via single-occupant cars and light trucks is an effective way of reducing automobile-related air pollution, traffic congestion, and energy use. Major employers have significant opportunities to encourage and facilitate reducing single-occupant vehicle commuting by employees. In addition, the legislature also recognizes the importance of increasing individual citizens' awareness of air quality, energy consumption, and traffic congestion, and the contribution individual actions can make towards addressing these issues.</p>
<p>The intent of this chapter is to require local governments in those counties experiencing the greatest automobile-related air pollution and traffic congestion to develop and implement plans to reduce single-occupant vehicle commute trips. Such plans shall require major employers and employers at major worksites to implement programs to reduce single-occupant vehicle commuting by employees at major worksites. Local governments in counties experiencing significant but less severe automobile-related air pollution and traffic congestion may implement such plans. State agencies shall implement programs to reduce single-occupant vehicle commuting at all major worksites throughout the state.</p>

<p>It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state that strong efforts should be made to minimize adverse effects on air quality from the open burning of field and turf grasses grown for seed. To such end this section is intended to promote the development of economical and practical alternate agricultural practices to such burning, and to provide for interim regulation of such burning until practical alternates are found.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall approve of a study or studies for the exploration and identification of economical and practical alternate agricultural practices to the open burning of field and turf grasses grown for seed. Any study conducted pursuant to this section shall be conducted by Washington State University. The university may not charge more than eight percent for administrative overhead. Prior to the issuance of any permit for such burning under RCW 70A.15.5090, there shall be collected a fee not to exceed one dollar per acre of crop to be burned. Any such fees received by any authority shall be transferred to the department of ecology. The department of ecology shall deposit all such acreage fees in the general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall allocate moneys annually for the support of any approved study or studies as provided for in subsection (1) of this section. The fee collected under subsection (1) of this section shall constitute the research portion of fees required under RCW 70A.15.5090 for open burning of grass grown for seed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever on the basis of information available to it, the department after public hearings have been conducted wherein testimony will be received and considered from interested parties wishing to testify shall conclude that any procedure, program, technique, or device constitutes a practical alternate agricultural practice to the open burning of field or turf grasses grown for seed, the department shall, by order, certify approval of such alternate. Thereafter, in any case which any such approved alternate is reasonably available, the open burning of field and turf grasses grown for seed shall be disallowed and no permit shall issue therefor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until approved alternates become available, the department or the authority may limit the number of acres on a pro rata basis among those affected for which permits to burn will be issued in order to effectively control emissions from this source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permits issued for burning of field and turf grasses may be conditioned to minimize emissions insofar as practical, including denial of permission to burn during periods of adverse meteorological conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every two years until grass seed burning is prohibited, Washington State University may prepare a brief report assessing the potential of the university's research to result in economical and practical alternatives to grass seed burning.</p>

<p>The department of ecology may delegate authority to adopt source emission reduction plans and authority to implement all stages of occurrence up to and including the warning stage, and all intermediate stages up to the warning stage, in any area of the state, to the air pollution control authority with jurisdiction therein.</p>
<p>The episode avoidance plan, which shall be established by regulation in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The designation of episode criteria and stages, the occurrence of which will require the carrying out of preplanned episode avoidance procedures. The stages of occurrence shall be (a) forecast, (b) alert, (c) warning, (d) emergency, and such intermediate stages as the department shall designate. &quot;Forecast&quot; means the presence of meteorological conditions that are conducive to accumulation of air contaminants and is the first stage of an episode. The department shall not call a forecast episode prior to the department or an authority calling a first stage impaired air quality condition as provided by RCW 70A.15.3580(1)(b) or calling a single-stage impaired air quality condition as provided by RCW 70A.15.3580. &quot;Alert&quot; means concentration of air contaminants at levels at which short-term health effects may occur, and is the second stage of an episode. &quot;Warning&quot; means concentrations are continuing to degrade, contaminant concentrations have reached a level which, if maintained, can result in damage to health, and additional control actions are needed and is the third level of an episode. &quot;Emergency&quot; means the air quality is posing an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and is the fourth level of an episode;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirement that persons responsible for the operation of air contaminant sources prepare and obtain approval from the director of source emission reduction plans, consistent with good operating practice and safe operating procedures, for reducing emissions during designated episode stages;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision for the director of the department of ecology or his or her authorized representative, or the air pollution control officer if implementation has been delegated, on the satisfaction of applicable criteria, to declare and terminate the forecast, alert, warning and all intermediate stages, up to the warning episode stage, such declarations constituting orders for action in accordance with applicable source emission reduction plans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision for the governor to declare and terminate the emergency stage and all intermediate stages above the warning episode stage, such declarations constituting orders in accordance with applicable source emission reduction plans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provisions for enforcement by state and local police, personnel of the departments of ecology and social and health services, and personnel of local air pollution control agencies; and</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The legislature recognizes that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Acid deposition resulting from commercial, industrial or other emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides pose a threat to the delicate balance of the state's ecological systems, particularly in alpine lakes that are known to be highly sensitive to acidification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to act promptly and decisively to mitigate or eliminate this danger may soon result in untold and irreparable damage to the fish, forest, wildlife, agricultural, water, and recreational resources of this state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a direct correlation between emissions of sulphur dioxides and nitrogen oxides and increases in acid deposition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acidification is cumulative; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once an environment is acidified, it is difficult, if not impossible, to restore the natural balance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is therefore the intent of the legislature to provide for early detection of acidification and the resulting environmental degradation through continued monitoring of acid deposition levels and trends, and major source changes, so that the legislature can take any necessary action to prevent environmental degradation resulting from acid deposition.</p>
