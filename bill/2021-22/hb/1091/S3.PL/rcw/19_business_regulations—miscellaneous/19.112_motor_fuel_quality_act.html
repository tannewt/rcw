<li>
<p>&quot;E85 motor fuel&quot; means an alternative fuel that is a blend of ethanol and hydrocarbon of which the ethanol portion is nominally seventy-five to eighty-five percent denatured fuel ethanol by volume that complies with the most recent version of American society of testing and materials specification D 5798.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Motor fuel&quot; means any liquid product used for the generation of power in an internal combustion engine used for the propulsion of a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state, and any biodiesel fuel. Motor fuels containing ethanol may be marketed if either (a) the base motor fuel meets the applicable standards before the addition of the ethanol or (b) the resultant blend meets the applicable standards after the addition of the ethanol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Nonhazardous motor fuel&quot; means any fuel of a type distributed for use in self-propelled motor vehicles that does not contain a hazardous liquid as defined in RCW 19.122.020.</p>

<p>This chapter shall be administered by the director or his or her authorized agent. For the purpose of administering this chapter, for motor fuel except biodiesel fuel, the standards set forth in the Annual Book of ASTM Standards and supplements thereto, and revisions thereof, are adopted, together with applicable federal environmental protection agency standards. If a conflict exists between federal environmental protection agency standards, ASTM standards, or state standards, for purposes of uniformity, federal environmental protection agency standards shall take precedence over ASTM standards. Any state standards adopted must be consistent with federal environmental protection agency standards and ASTM standards not in conflict with federal environmental protection agency standards.</p>

<p>The director shall adopt rules for maintaining standards for biodiesel fuel or fuel blended with biodiesel fuel by adopting all or part of the standards set forth in the Annual Book of ASTM Standards and supplements, amendments, or revisions thereof, all or part of the standards set forth in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbook 130, Uniform Laws and Regulations in the areas of legal metrology and engine fuel quality rules, and any supplements, amendments, or revisions thereof, together with applicable federal environmental protection agency standards. The rules shall provide that the biodiesel refiner is responsible for meeting the ASTM standards required by chapter 338, Laws of 2006 when providing biodiesel fuel into the distribution system. If a conflict exists between federal environmental protection agency standards, ASTM standards, or NIST standards, for purposes of uniformity, federal environmental protection agency standards shall take precedence over ASTM and NIST standards. The department of agriculture shall not exceed ASTM standards for diesel.</p>

<p>The director shall establish a biofuels advisory committee to advise the director on implementing or suspending the minimum renewable fuel content requirements. The committee shall advise the director on applicability to all users; logistical, technical, and economic issues of implementation, including the potential for credit trading, compliance and enforcement provisions, and tracking and reporting requirements; and how the use of renewable fuel blends greater than two percent and renewable fuels other than biodiesel or ethanol could achieve the goals of chapter 338, Laws of 2006. In addition, the committee shall make recommendations to the legislature and governor on the potential to use alternatives to biodiesel, which are produced from nonpetroleum renewable sources (inclusive of vegetable oils and animal fats), to meet the minimum renewable fuel content requirement. The director shall make recommendations to the legislature and the governor on the implementation or suspension of chapter 338, Laws of 2006 by September 1, 2007.</p>
