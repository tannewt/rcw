<p>The legislature recognizes that agriculture is the most basic and singularly important industry in the state, that agriculture is of central importance to the welfare and economic stability of the state, and that the maintenance of this vital industry requires a continued source of trained and qualified individuals who qualify for employment in agriculture <strong>, food, and natural resource career pathways.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The legislature finds that research shows that students enrolled in a career and technical education program in high school have a higher graduation rate than other students, and that the agricultural education branch of career and technical education fosters an understanding of the history and principles of agriculture, agriscience, manufacturing, agribusiness, leadership, advocacy, career-connected learning experiences, and community service.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The legislature, therefore, intends to promote comprehensive and formal instruction in agricultural education, and membership in the corresponding career and technical student organizations, to provide students with the opportunity to:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>Develop fundamental leadership and communication skills;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop an applied understanding of the agricultural industry and its potential;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Explore and understand career opportunities through supervised experiences;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Engage with industry mentors; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan for career and college success.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In an effort to assist actions of schools to offer career and technical education courses, the legislature intends to support dropout prevention programs and career readiness, and improve learning opportunities and educational outcomes in agriculture, food, and natural resource education</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature declares that it is within the best interests of the people and state of Washington that a comprehensive <strong>career-connected learning opportunity through a career and technical education program in agriculture, food, and natural resource sciences</strong> be maintained in the state's secondary school system <strong>in order to ensure an adequate supply of trained and skilled individuals</strong>.</p>
