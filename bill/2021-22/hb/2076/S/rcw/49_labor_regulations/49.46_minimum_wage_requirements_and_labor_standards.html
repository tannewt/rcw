<p>Whereas the establishment of a minimum wage for employees is a subject of vital and imminent concern to the people of this state and requires appropriate action by the legislature to establish minimum standards of employment within the state of Washington, therefore the legislature declares that in its considered judgment the health, safety and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, and exercising its police power, the legislature endeavors by this chapter to establish a minimum wage for employees of this state to encourage employment opportunities within the state. The provisions of this chapter are enacted in the exercise of the police power of the state for the purpose of protecting the immediate and future health, safety and welfare of the people of this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the enactment of Washington's original minimum wage act, the legislature and the people have repeatedly amended this chapter to establish and enforce modern fair labor standards, including periodically updating the minimum wage and establishing the forty-hour workweek and the right to overtime pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people hereby amend this chapter to conform to modern fair labor standards by establishing a fair minimum wage and the right to paid sick leave to protect public health and allow workers to care for the health of themselves and their families.</p>

<p>(B) An agreed-upon just cause standard for upholding deactivations;</p>
<p>(C) Within 30 calendar days of a request, furnishing to the driver and driver representative information and evidence the transportation network company relied upon in making the deactivation decision, provided that personal identifying information is redacted to address reasonable privacy concerns;</p>
<p>(D) A good faith, substantive informal resolution process that is committed to efficient resolution of deactivation conflicts within 30 days of the transportation network company being notified of the conflict;</p>
<p>(E) A formal process for adjudication by a panel composed of peer drivers mutually selected by the transportation network company and the driver resource center and administered by a neutral third-party moderator. The panel has the authority to make binding, make-whole monetary awards, including back pay, based on an agreed-upon formula for cases not resolved during the informal process; and</p>
<p>(F) Agreement by the transportation network company to use the formal process set forth in this subsection to resolve disputes over deactivations as an alternative to individual arbitration with regard to such a dispute, should the driver so choose; and</p>
<pre><code>    ii. An ongoing process for drivers to have a voice in working conditions, including policy changes that impact their work.

b. Any agreement under this section must be submitted to the department for approval. The department shall review the agreement to ensure that its content is consistent with this subsection and the public policy goals set forth in this subsection. The department shall consider in its review both qualitative and quantitative effects of the agreement, how the agreement comports with the state policies set forth in this section, and any available business data and economic studies. In conducting a review, the record shall not be limited to the submissions of the parties nor to the terms of the proposed agreement. The department shall have the right to gather and consider any necessary evidence, including by conducting public hearings and requesting additional information from the parties. The department may approve or reject a proposed agreement, and may require the parties to submit a revised proposal on all or particular parts of the proposed agreement. If the department rejects all or part of an agreement, it shall set forth its reasoning in writing and shall suggest ways the parties may remedy the failures. Absent good cause, the department shall issue a written determination regarding its approval, rejection, or any suggestions in the event of rejection of all or part of the agreement, within 30 days of submission of the agreement.
