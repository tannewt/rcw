<p>The state expressly intends to displace competition with regulation allowing a transportation network company and its drivers collectively to enter agreements with the driver resource center. The state policy is to promote the rights of drivers and transportation network companies and provide fair processes related to driver account activation. The state intends that any agreement under this section is immune from all federal and state antitrust laws. A transportation network company may, at its own volition, enter into an agreement with the driver resource center regarding the driver account deactivation process. Any agreement must be approved by the department. The department may approve an agreement only if the agreement contains the following:</p>

<li>The agreement must provide due process for drivers who face account deactivation. Due process must include the following protections:</li>

<p>(A) Opportunity for a driver representative to support drivers throughout the deactivation process;</p>
<p>(B) An agreed-upon just cause standard for upholding deactivations;</p>
<p>(C) Within 30 calendar days of a request, furnishing to the driver and driver representative information and evidence the transportation network company relied upon in making the deactivation decision, provided that personal identifying information is redacted to address reasonable privacy concerns;</p>
<p>(D) A good faith, substantive informal resolution process that is committed to efficient resolution of deactivation conflicts within 30 days of the transportation network company being notified of the conflict;</p>
<p>(E) A formal process for adjudication by a panel composed of peer drivers mutually selected by the transportation network company and the driver resource center and administered by a neutral third-party moderator. The panel has the authority to make binding, make-whole monetary awards, including back pay, based on an agreed-upon formula for cases not resolved during the informal process; and</p>
<p>(F) Agreement by the transportation network company to use the formal process set forth in this subsection to resolve disputes over deactivations as an alternative to individual arbitration with regard to such a dispute, should the driver so choose; and</p>
<pre><code>    ii. An ongoing process for drivers to have a voice in working conditions, including policy changes that impact their work.

b. Any agreement under this section must be submitted to the department for approval. The department shall review the agreement to ensure that its content is consistent with this subsection and the public policy goals set forth in this subsection. The department shall consider in its review both qualitative and quantitative effects of the agreement, how the agreement comports with the state policies set forth in this section, and any available business data and economic studies. In conducting a review, the record shall not be limited to the submissions of the parties nor to the terms of the proposed agreement. The department shall have the right to gather and consider any necessary evidence, including by conducting public hearings and requesting additional information from the parties. The department may approve or reject a proposed agreement, and may require the parties to submit a revised proposal on all or particular parts of the proposed agreement. If the department rejects all or part of an agreement, it shall set forth its reasoning in writing and shall suggest ways the parties may remedy the failures. Absent good cause, the department shall issue a written determination regarding its approval, rejection, or any suggestions in the event of rejection of all or part of the agreement, within 30 days of submission of the agreement.

<p>Before being used to provide commercial transportation services, every personal vehicle must be covered by a primary automobile insurance policy that specifically covers commercial transportation services. However, the insurance coverage requirements of this section are alternatively satisfied by securing coverage pursuant to chapter 46.72 or 46.72A RCW that covers the personal vehicle being used to provide commercial transportation services and that is in effect twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a commercial transportation services provider must secure this policy for every personal vehicle used to provide commercial transportation services. For purposes of this section, a &quot;primary automobile insurance policy&quot; is not a private passenger automobile insurance policy.</p>

<p>In addition to the requirements in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, before allowing a person to provide commercial transportation services as a driver, a commercial transportation services provider must provide written proof to the driver that the driver is covered by a primary automobile insurance policy that meets the requirements of this section.

This right to exclude all coverage may apply to any coverage included in a private passenger automobile insurance policy including, but not limited to:</p>

</li>

<p>Insurers that exclude coverage under subsection (6) of this section have no duty to defend or indemnify any claim expressly excluded under subsection (6) of this section. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to invalidate or limit an exclusion contained in a policy, including any policy in use or approved for use in Washington state before July 24, 2015, that excludes coverage for vehicles used to carry persons or property for a charge or available for hire by the public.</p>
</li>

<p>An exclusion exercised by an insurer in subsection (6) of this section applies to any coverage selected or rejected by a named insured under RCW 48.22.030 and 48.22.085. The purchase of a rider or endorsement by a driver under subsection (2)(a) of this section does not require a separate coverage rejection under RCW 48.22.030 or 48.22.085.</p>

<p>If more than one insurance policy provides valid and collectible coverage for a loss arising out of an occurrence involving a motor vehicle operated by a driver, the responsibility for the claim must be divided as follows:</p>

<p>Except as provided otherwise under subsection (2)(c) of this section, if the driver has been matched with a passenger and is traveling to pick up the passenger, or the driver is providing services to a passenger, the commercial transportation services provider that matched the driver and passenger must provide insurance coverage; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the driver is logged in to the digital network or software application of more than one commercial transportation services provider but has not been matched with a passenger, the liability must be divided equally among all of the applicable insurance policies that specifically provide coverage for commercial transportation services.</p>

<p>In an accident or claims coverage investigation, a commercial transportation services provider or its insurer must cooperate with a private passenger automobile insurance policy insurer and other insurers that are involved in the claims coverage investigation to facilitate the exchange of information, including the provision of (a) dates and times at which an accident occurred that involved a participating driver and (b) within ten business days after receiving a request, a copy of the provider's electronic record showing the precise times that the participating driver logged on and off the provider's digital network or software application on the day the accident or other loss occurred. The commercial transportation services provider or its insurer must retain all data, communications, or documents related to insurance coverage or accident details for a period of not less than the applicable statutes of limitation, plus two years from the date of an accident to which those records pertain.</p>

<p>This section does not modify or abrogate any otherwise applicable insurance requirement set forth in this title.</p>

<p>If an insurer for a commercial transportation services provider makes a payment for a claim covered under comprehensive coverage or collision coverage, the commercial transportation services provider must cause its insurer to issue the payment directly to the business repairing the vehicle or jointly to the owner of the vehicle and the primary lienholder on the covered vehicle.</p>
