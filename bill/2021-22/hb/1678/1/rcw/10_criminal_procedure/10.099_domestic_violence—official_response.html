<p>The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the importance of domestic violence as a serious crime against society and to assure the victim of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse which the law and those who enforce the law can provide. The legislature finds that the existing criminal statutes are adequate to provide protection for victims of domestic violence. However, previous societal attitudes have been reflected in policies and practices of law enforcement agencies and prosecutors which have resulted in differing treatment of crimes occurring between cohabitants and of the same crimes occurring between strangers. Only recently has public perception of the serious consequences of domestic violence to society and to the victims led to the recognition of the necessity for early intervention by law enforcement agencies. It is the intent of the legislature that the official response to cases of domestic violence shall stress the enforcement of the laws to protect the victim and shall communicate the attitude that violent behavior is not excused or tolerated. Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature that criminal laws be enforced without regard to whether the persons involved are or were married, cohabiting, or involved in a relationship.</p>

<p>In issuing the order, the court shall consider all information documented in the incident report concerning the person's possession of and access to firearms and whether law enforcement took temporary custody of firearms at the time of the arrest.

<p>All superior courts, and courts organized under Title 3 or 35 RCW, may impose a penalty assessment not to exceed one hundred dollars on any ((person))adult offender convicted of a crime involving domestic violence. The assessment shall be in addition to, and shall not supersede, any other penalty, restitution, fines, or costs provided by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue from the assessment shall be used solely for the purposes of establishing and funding domestic violence advocacy and domestic violence prevention and prosecution programs in the city or county of the court imposing the assessment. Revenue from the assessment shall not be used for indigent criminal defense. If the city or county does not have domestic violence advocacy or domestic violence prevention and prosecution programs, cities and counties may use the revenue collected from the assessment to contract with recognized community-based domestic violence program providers.</p>

<p>The assessment imposed under this section shall not be subject to any state or local remittance requirements under chapter 3.46, 3.50, 3.62, 7.68, 10.82, or 35.20 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;convicted&quot; includes a plea of guilty, a finding of guilt regardless of whether the imposition of the sentence is deferred or any part of the penalty is suspended, or the levying of a fine. For the purposes of this section, &quot;domestic violence&quot; has the same meaning as that term is defined under RCW 10.99.020 and includes violations of equivalent local ordinances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When determining whether to impose a penalty assessment under this section, judges are encouraged to solicit input from the victim or representatives for the victim in assessing the ability of the convicted offender to pay the penalty, including information regarding current financial obligations, family circumstances, and ongoing restitution.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) this section, a serious domestic violence offender may petition the superior court for removal from the serious domestic violence offender registry when he or she has spent 10 consecutive years in the community without being convicted of any felony or any domestic violence offense during that time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A serious domestic violence offender whose appearance on the serious domestic violence offender registry is based exclusively on one or more domestic violence offenses committed as a juvenile may petition for removal from the serious domestic violence offender registry under the following timelines:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the offense or offenses requiring registration include any class A felony domestic violence offenses, the offender may petition when: (i) At least five years have passed since the petitioner's adjudication and completion of any term of confinement for the offense or offenses giving rise to inclusion on the registry; and (ii) the petitioner has not been adjudicated or convicted of any felony or any domestic violence offenses within the five years before the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other domestic violence offenses committed by a juvenile not included in (a) of this subsection, the offender may petition when: (i) At least 24 months have passed since the petitioner's adjudication and completion of any term of confinement for the offense giving rise to inclusion on the registry; and (ii) the petitioner has not been adjudicated or convicted of any felony or any domestic violence offenses within the 24 months before the petition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition for relief from registration must be made to the court in which the petitioner was ordered to be included on the serious domestic violence offender registry. The prosecuting attorney of the county must be named and served as the respondent in any petition. The prosecuting attorney must make reasonable efforts to notify the victim via the victim's choice of telephone, letter, or email, if known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The court may order the petitioner's removal from the registry only if the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant removal from the registry. If the petitioner's inclusion on the registry is based entirely on offenses committed while the petitioner was a juvenile, the petitioner's burden of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant removal from the registry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether the petitioner is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant removal from the registry, the following factors are provided as guidance to assist the court in making its determination:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The nature of the domestic violence offenses committed, including the number of victims and the length of the offense history;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any subsequent criminal history;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petitioner's compliance with any applicable supervision requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The length of time since the charged incident or incidents occurred;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any input from community corrections officers, law enforcement, treatment providers, or other criminal justice professionals;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>The petitioner's stability in employment and housing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petitioner's community and personal support system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any risk assessments or evaluations prepared by a qualified professional; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code> ix. Any other factors the court may consider relevant.

</li>
<li>
<p>If a serious domestic violence offender's entry on the registry lists an offense for which the conviction is subsequently overturned or otherwise set aside by court order on grounds consistent with innocence, the serious domestic violence offender may petition the court for removal of the offense from the registry. If the court finds that the offense conviction has been overturned or otherwise set aside by court order on grounds consistent with innocence, the court may order that the offense be removed from the registry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person is granted an order of removal from the registry or removal of an offense from the registry pursuant to this section, the order of removal does not constitute a certificate of rehabilitation, or the equivalent of a certificate of rehabilitation, for the purposes of restoration of firearm possession under RCW 9.41.040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders removal from the registry or removal of an offense from the registry, the court must send a copy of the order to the Washington state patrol. The Washington state patrol must remove the person from the registry within 30 calendar days.</p>

A serious domestic violence offender who applies to change his or her name under RCW 4.24.130 or any other law shall submit a copy of the application to the Washington state patrol not fewer than five days before the entry of an order granting the name change. A serious domestic violence offender may not be granted an order changing his or her name under RCW 4.24.130 or any other law if the court finds that doing so will interfere with legitimate law enforcement interests, except that no order may be denied when the name change is requested in recognition of marriage or dissolution of marriage. A court granting an order changing the name of a serious domestic violence offender must submit a copy of the order to the Washington state patrol within 72 hours of the entry of the order.</p>
