<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to continue the department's policy giving priority consideration to abutting property owners in agricultural areas when disposing of property through its surplus property program under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever the department determines that any real property owned by the state of Washington and under the jurisdiction of the department is no longer required for transportation purposes and that it is in the public interest to do so, the department may sell the property or exchange it in full or part consideration for land or building improvements or for construction of highway improvements at fair market value to any person through the solicitation of written bids through public advertising in the manner prescribed under RCW 47.28.050 or in the manner prescribed under RCW 47.12.283.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may forego the processes prescribed by RCW 47.28.050 and 47.12.283 and sell the real property to any of the following entities or persons at fair market value**, except as specified in subsection (9) of this section during the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium**:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any other state agency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county in which the property is situated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other municipal corporation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regional transit authorities created under chapter 81.112 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The former owner of the property from whom the state acquired title;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of residentially improved property, a tenant of the department who has resided thereon for not less than six months and who is not delinquent in paying rent to the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any abutting private owner but only after each other abutting private owner (if any), as shown in the records of the county assessor, is notified in writing of the proposed sale. If more than one abutting private owner requests in writing the right to purchase the property within fifteen days after receiving notice of the proposed sale, the property shall be sold at public auction in the manner provided in RCW 47.12.283;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To any other owner of real property required for transportation purposes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of property suitable for residential use, any nonprofit organization dedicated to providing affordable housing to very low-income, low-income, and moderate-income households as defined in RCW 43.63A.510 and is eligible to receive assistance through the Washington housing trust fund created in chapter 43.185 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>During the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, any nonprofit organization that identifies real property to be sold or conveyed as a substitute for real property owned by the nonprofit within the city of Seattle to be redeveloped for the purpose of affordable housing; or</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A federally recognized Indian tribe within whose reservation boundary the property is located.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When selling real property pursuant to RCW 47.12.283, the department may withhold or withdraw the property from an auction when requested by one of the entities or persons listed in subsection (3) of this section and only after the receipt of a nonrefundable deposit equal to <strong>10</strong> percent of the fair market value of the real property or <strong>$5,000</strong>, whichever is less. This subsection does not prohibit the department from exercising its discretion to withhold or withdraw the real property from an auction if the department determines that the property is no longer surplus or chooses to sell the property through one of the other means listed in subsection (2) of this section. If a transaction under this subsection is not completed within <strong>60</strong> days, the real property must be put back up for sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales to purchasers may, at the department's option, be for cash, by real estate contract, or exchange of land or highway improvements. Transactions involving the construction of improvements must be conducted pursuant to chapter 47.28 RCW and Title 39 RCW, as applicable, and must comply with all other applicable laws and rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conveyances made pursuant to this section shall be by deed executed by the secretary of transportation and shall be duly acknowledged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise provided, all moneys received pursuant to the provisions of this section less any real estate broker commissions paid pursuant to RCW 47.12.320 shall be deposited in the motor vehicle fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not enter into equal value exchanges or property acquisitions for building improvements without first consulting with the office of financial management and the joint transportation committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>During the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, the department may sell or convey surplus property at less than its fair market value when the department finds that it is in the public interest to do so because:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>The surplus property will be used as a substitute for property to be redeveloped to provide the public benefit of affordable housing; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The development of affordable housing on that property would not otherwise be adequately compensated.</strong></p>
</li>
