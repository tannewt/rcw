<ol>
<li>
<p>Sustainable and resilient markets for recycled materials are essential to any successful recycling system. For many years, Washington has depended on foreign markets to accept the recyclable materials that are collected for recycling in the state. Developing domestic markets for recycled materials benefits the environment and the state's economy and is critical due to the loss of foreign markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China's 2018 national sword policy bans the importation of recycled mixed paper and certain types of recycled plastic and imposes a stringent contamination limit on all other recycled material imports. Washington's recycling facilities are struggling to find markets for recyclable materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plastic packaging can be recycled and can contain recycled content in order to close the loop in the recycling stream. Many companies have already taken the initiative at closing the loop by using plastic bottles that contain 100 percent recycled content. Since November 2010, one national juice company has been using bottles made with 100 percent postconsumer recycled content for all of its juices and juice smoothies. In January 2018, an international beverage producer announced that it will make all its bottles from 100 percent recycled plastic by 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that costs to plastic packaging producers will be capped and predictable. The requirements imposed by this chapter are reasonable and are achievable at minimal cost relative to the burden imposed by the continued excessive use of virgin materials in plastic packaging in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature encourages plastic packaging producers to use plastic packaging that exceeds the standards set forth in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that by January 1, 2025, all plastic packaging sold in the state of Washington be either recyclable or compostable.</p>

<p>Beginning in 2024, and every other year thereafter, or at the petition of a producer or the plastic packaging industry but not more than annually, the department shall consider whether the minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements established under subsection (1) of this section should be reduced. The department must consider a petition from the plastic packaging industry within 60 days of receipt and must issue a written response.

The department may not adjust the minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements above the applicable minimum postconsumer recycled content percentage for the applicable compliance period, as established in subsection (1) of this section. The department may not adjust the minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements below the lowest applicable material compliance level set in subsection (1) of this section. In making a determination to adjust the minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements, the department must at least consider the following:</p>

<p>There is hereby created an account within the state treasury to be known as the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account shall be used as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Forty percent to the department of ecology, primarily for use by the departments of ecology, natural resources, revenue, transportation, and corrections, and the parks and recreation commission, for litter collection programs under RCW 70A.200.170. The amount to the department of ecology shall also be used for a central coordination function for litter control efforts statewide; to support employment of youth in litter cleanup as intended in RCW 70A.200.020, and for litter pick up using other authorized agencies; and for statewide public awareness programs under RCW 70A.200.150(7). The amount to the department shall also be used to defray the costs of administering the funding, coordination, and oversight of local government programs for waste reduction, litter control, recycling, and composting so that local governments can apply one hundred percent of their funding to achieving program goals. The amount to the department of revenue shall be used to enforce compliance with the litter tax imposed in chapter 82.19 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Twenty percent to the department for local government funding programs for waste reduction, litter control, recycling activities, and composting activities by cities and counties under RCW 70A.200.190, to be administered by the department of ecology; (ii) any unspent funds under (b)(i) of this subsection may be used to create and pay for a matching fund competitive grant program to be used by local governments for the development and implementation of contamination reduction and outreach plans for inclusion in comprehensive solid waste management plans or by local governments and nonprofit organizations for local or statewide education programs designed to help the public with litter control, waste reduction, recycling, and composting of primarily the products taxed under chapter 82.19 RCW. Recipients under this subsection include programs to reduce wasted food and food waste that are designed to achieve the goals established in RCW 70A.205.715(1) and that are consistent with the plan developed in RCW 70A.205.715(3). Grants must adhere to the following requirements: (A) No grant may exceed sixty thousand dollars; (B) grant recipients shall match the grant funding allocated by the department by an amount equal to twenty-five percent of eligible expenses. A local government's share of these costs may be met by cash or contributed services; (C) the obligation of the department to make grant payments is contingent upon the availability of the amount of money appropriated for this subsection (1)(b); and (D) grants are managed under the guidelines for existing grant programs;</li>
