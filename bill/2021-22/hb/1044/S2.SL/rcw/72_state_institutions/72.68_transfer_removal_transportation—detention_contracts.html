The secretary has the authority to transfer <strong>incarcerated individuals</strong> between in-state correctional facilities or to out-of-state governmental institutions if the secretary determines that transfer is in the best interest of the state or the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong>. The determination of what is in the best interest of the state or <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> may include but is not limited to considerations of overcrowding, emergency conditions, or hardship to the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong>. In determining whether the transfer will impose a hardship on the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong>, the secretary shall consider: (a) The location of the <strong>incarcerated individual's</strong> family and whether the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> has maintained contact with members of his or her family; (b) whether, if the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> has maintained contact, the contact will be significantly disrupted by the transfer due to the family's inability to maintain the contact as a result of the transfer; and (c) whether the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> is enrolled in a vocational or educational program that cannot reasonably be resumed <strong>or completed</strong> if the <strong>incarcerated individual</strong> is <strong>transferred to another correctional institution or</strong> returned to the state.</p>
