Efforts under this subsection should include a focus on appropriate oversight of implementation of evidence‑based practices to ensure fidelity to these practices and thereby achieve positive outcomes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue the successful implementation of the &quot;partnerships for success&quot; model by consulting with communities so they may select, implement, and continually evaluate the success of evidence-based practices that are relevant to the needs of children, youth, and families in their community;</p>

<pre><code>    iii. **The mental health referral service for children and teens** to facilitate referrals to children's mental health services and other resources for parents and guardians with concerns related to the mental health of the parent or guardian's child.
