<p>Subject to funds appropriated for this purpose or otherwise available in the account established in RCW 28A.175.155, beginning in the 2011-12 school year and each year thereafter, a high school that demonstrates improvement in its dropout prevention score compared to the baseline school year as calculated under RCW 28A.175.140 may receive a PASS program award as provided under this section. The legislature intends to recognize and reward continuous improvement by using a baseline year for calculating eligibility for PASS program awards so that a high school retains previously earned award funds from one year to the next unless its performance declines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must determine the amount of PASS program awards based on appropriated funds and eligible high schools. The intent of the legislature is to provide an award to each eligible high school commensurate with the degree of improvement in the high school's dropout prevention score and the size of the high school. The office must establish a minimum award amount. If funds available for PASS program awards are not sufficient to provide an award to each eligible high school, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall establish objective criteria to prioritize awards based on eligible high schools with the greatest need for additional dropout prevention and intervention services. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall encourage and may require a high school receiving a PASS program award to demonstrate an amount of community matching funds or an amount of in‑kind community services to support dropout prevention and intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ninety percent of an award under this section must be allocated to the eligible high school to be used for dropout prevention activities in the school as specified in subsection (2) of this section. The principal of the high school shall determine the use of funds after consultation with parents and certificated and classified staff of the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ten percent of an award under this section must be allocated to the school district in which the eligible high school is located to be used for dropout prevention activities as specified in subsection (2) of this section in the high school or in other schools in the district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction may withhold distribution of award funds under this section to an otherwise eligible high school or school district if the superintendent of public instruction issues a finding that the school or school district has willfully manipulated the dropout prevention indicators under RCW 28A.175.140, for example by expelling, suspending, transferring, or refusing to enroll students at risk of dropping out of school or at risk of low achievement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>High schools and school districts may use PASS program award funds for any programs or activities that support the development of a dropout prevention, intervention, and reengagement system as described in RCW 28A.175.074, offered directly by the school or school district or under contract with education agencies or community-based organizations, including but not limited to educational service districts, workforce development councils, and boys and girls clubs. Such programs or activities may include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Strategies to close the achievement gap for disadvantaged students and minority students;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of graduation coaches as defined in RCW 28A.175.150;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunity internship activities under RCW 28C.18.164;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dropout reengagement programs provided by community-based organizations or community and technical colleges;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive guidance and planning programs as defined under RCW 28A.600.045, including but not limited to the navigation 101 program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced class sizes, extended school day, extended school year, and tutoring programs for students identified as at risk of dropping out of school, including instruction to assist these students in meeting graduation requirements in mathematics and science;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outreach and counseling targeted to students identified as at risk of dropping out of school, or who have dropped out of school, to encourage them to consider learning alternatives such as preapprenticeship programs, skill centers, running start, technical high schools, and other options for completing a high school diploma;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preapprenticeship programs  under RCW 49.04.190;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentoring programs for students;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development and use of dropout early warning data systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counseling, resource and referral services, and intervention programs to address social, behavioral, and health factors associated with dropping out of school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing programs for in-school suspension or other strategies to avoid excluding middle and high school students from the school whenever possible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parent engagement activities such as home visits and off-campus parent support group meetings related to dropout prevention and reengagement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early learning programs for prekindergarten students.</p>
</li>

<p>Subject to funds appropriated specifically for this purpose, the academic acceleration incentive program is established as provided in this section. The intent of the legislature is that the funds awarded under the program be used to support teacher training, curriculum, technology, examination fees, textbook fees, and other costs associated with offering dual credit courses to high school students, including transportation for running start students to and from the institution of higher education as defined in RCW 28A.600.300.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall allocate half of the funds appropriated for the purposes of this section on a competitive basis to provide one-time grants for high schools to expand the availability of dual credit courses. To be eligible for a grant, a school district must have adopted an academic acceleration policy as provided under RCW 28A.320.195. In making grant awards, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must give priority to grants for high schools with a high proportion of low-income students and high schools seeking to develop new capacity for dual credit courses rather than proposing marginal expansion of current capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall allocate half of the funds appropriated for the purposes of this section to school districts as an incentive award for each student who earned dual high school and college credit, as described under subsection (4) of this section, for courses offered by the district's high schools during the previous school year. School districts must distribute the award to the high schools that generated the funds. The award amount for low-income students eligible to participate in the federal free and reduced-price meals program who earn dual credits must be set at one hundred twenty-five percent of the base award for other students. A student who earns more than one dual credit in the same school year counts only once for the purposes of the incentive award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the following students are considered to have earned dual high school and college credit in a course offered by a high school:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Students who achieve a score of three or higher on an AP examination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who achieve a score of four or higher on an examination of the international baccalaureate diploma programme;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who successfully complete a Cambridge advanced international certificate of education examination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who successfully complete a course through the college in the high school program under RCW 28A.600.287 and are awarded credit by the partnering institution of higher education; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who satisfy the dual enrollment and class performance requirements to earn college credit through a <strong>career and technical education</strong> course.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a high school provides access to online courses for students to earn dual high school and college credit at no cost to the student, such a course is considered to be offered by the high school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall report to the education policy committees and the fiscal committees of the legislature, by January 1st of each year, information about the demographics of the students earning dual credits in the schools receiving grants under this section for the prior school year.
