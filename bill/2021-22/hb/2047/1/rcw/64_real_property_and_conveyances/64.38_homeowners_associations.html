<h2 id="6438010---definitions-7">64.38.010 - Definitions. <a class="header-anchor" href="#6438010---definitions-7">¶</a></h2>
<p>For purposes of this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Assessment&quot; means all sums chargeable to an owner by an association in accordance with RCW 64.38.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Baseline funding plan&quot; means establishing a reserve funding goal of maintaining a reserve account balance above zero dollars throughout the thirty-year study period described under RCW 64.38.065.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Board of directors&quot; or &quot;board&quot; means the body, regardless of name, with primary authority to manage the affairs of the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Common areas&quot; means property owned, or otherwise maintained, repaired or administered by the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Common expense&quot; means the costs incurred by the association to exercise any of the powers provided for in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Contribution rate&quot; means, in a reserve study as described in RCW 64.38.065, the amount contributed to the reserve account so that the association will have cash reserves to pay major maintenance, repair, or replacement costs without the need of a special assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Effective age&quot; means the difference between the estimated useful life and remaining useful life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Electronic transmission&quot; or &quot;electronically transmitted&quot; means any electronic communication not directly involving the physical transfer of a writing in a tangible medium, but that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by the sender and the recipient of the communication, and that may be directly reproduced in a tangible medium by a sender and recipient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Full funding plan&quot; means setting a reserve funding goal of achieving one hundred percent fully funded reserves by the end of the thirty-year study period described under RCW 64.38.065, in which the reserve account balance equals the sum of the deteriorated portion of all reserve components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Fully funded balance&quot; means the current value of the deteriorated portion, not the total replacement value, of all the reserve components. The fully funded balance for each reserve component is calculated by multiplying the current replacement cost of the reserve component by its effective age, then dividing the result by the reserve component's useful life. The sum total of all reserve components' fully funded balances is the association's fully funded balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Governing documents&quot; means the articles of incorporation, bylaws, plat, declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions, rules and regulations of the association, or other written instrument by which the association has the authority to exercise any of the powers provided for in this chapter or to manage, maintain, or otherwise affect the property under its jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Homeowners' association&quot; or &quot;association&quot; means a corporation, unincorporated association, or other legal entity, each member of which is an owner of residential real property located within the association's jurisdiction, as described in the governing documents, and by virtue of membership or ownership of property is obligated to pay real property taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance costs, or for improvement of real property other than that which is owned by the member. &quot;Homeowners' association&quot; does not mean an association created under chapter 64.32 or 64.34 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Lot&quot; means a physical portion of the real property located within an association's jurisdiction designated for separate ownership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Owner&quot; means the owner of a lot, but does not include a person who has an interest in a lot solely as security for an obligation. &quot;Owner&quot; also means the vendee, not the vendor, of a lot under a real estate contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Remaining useful life&quot; means the estimated time, in years, before a reserve component will require major maintenance, repair, or replacement to perform its intended function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Replacement cost&quot; means the current cost of replacing, repairing, or restoring a reserve component to its original functional condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Reserve component&quot; means a common element whose cost of maintenance, repair, or replacement is infrequent, significant, and impractical to include in an annual budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Reserve study professional&quot; means an independent person who is suitably qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to prepare a reserve study in accordance with RCW 64.38.065 and 64.38.070.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Residential real property&quot; means any real property, the use of which is limited by law, covenant or otherwise to primarily residential or recreational purposes.</p>

<p>&quot;Significant assets&quot; means that the current replacement value of the major reserve components is seventy-five percent or more of the gross budget of the association, excluding the association's reserve account funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Tangible medium&quot; means a writing, copy of a writing, facsimile, or a physical reproduction, each on paper or on other tangible material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Useful life&quot; means the estimated time, between years, that major maintenance, repair, or replacement is estimated to occur.</p>
</li>

<p>The consent of any lot owner is revoked if the association is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices and this inability becomes known to the secretary of the association of apartment owners or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the association of apartment owners to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action.</p>

<li>
<p>Owners may vote at a meeting in person, by absentee ballot pursuant to subsection (3)(d) of this section, or by a proxy pursuant to subsection (5) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a vote is conducted without a meeting, owners may vote by ballot pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a meeting of owners the following requirements apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Owners or their proxies who are present in person may vote by voice vote, show of hands, standing, written ballot, or any other method for determining the votes of owners, as designated by the person presiding at the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If only one of several owners of a lot is present, that lot owner is entitled to cast all the votes allocated to that lot. If more than one of the lot owners are present, the votes allocated to that lot may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority in interest of the lot owners, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There is a majority agreement if any one of the lot owners casts the votes allocated to the lot without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other lot owners of the lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless a greater number or fraction of the votes in the association is required under this chapter or the declaration or organizational documents, a majority of the votes cast determines the outcome of any action of the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever proposals or board members are to be voted upon at a meeting, an owner may vote by duly executed absentee ballot if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The name of each candidate and the text of each proposal to be voted upon are set forth in a writing accompanying or contained in the notice of meeting; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ballot is provided by the association for such purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an owner votes by absentee ballot, the association must be able to verify that the ballot is cast by the owner having the right to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided otherwise in the declaration or organizational documents, the following requirements apply with respect to proxy voting:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Votes allocated to a lot may be cast pursuant to a directed or undirected proxy duly executed by a lot owner in the same manner as provided in RCW 24.06.110.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a lot is owned by more than one person, each lot owner of the lot may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other lot owners of the lot through a duly executed proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An owner may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section only by actual notice of revocation to the secretary or the person presiding over a meeting of the association or by delivery of a subsequent proxy. The death or disability of an owner does not revoke a proxy given by the owner unless the person presiding over the meeting has actual notice of the death or disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless stated otherwise in the proxy, a proxy terminates eleven months after its date of issuance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless prohibited or limited by the declaration or organizational documents, an association may conduct a vote without a meeting. In that event, the following requirements apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The association must notify the owners that the vote will be taken by ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice must state:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The time and date by which a ballot must be delivered to the association to be counted, which may not be fewer than fourteen days after the date of the notice, and which deadline may be extended in accordance with (g) of this subsection;</p>

<li>
<p>The percent of votes necessary to meet the quorum requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The percent of votes necessary to approve each matter other than election of board members; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time, date, and manner by which owners wishing to deliver information to all owners regarding the subject of the vote may do so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association must deliver a ballot to every owner with the notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ballot must set forth each proposed action and provide an opportunity to vote for or against the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ballot cast pursuant to this section may be revoked only by actual notice to the association of revocation. The death or disability of an owner does not revoke a ballot unless the association has actual notice of the death or disability prior to the date set forth in (b)(i) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval by ballot pursuant to this subsection is valid only if the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the association does not receive a sufficient number of votes to constitute a quorum or to approve the proposal by the date and time established for return of ballots, the board may extend the deadline for a reasonable period not to exceed eleven months upon further notice to all members in accordance with (b) of this subsection. In that event, all votes previously cast on the proposal must be counted unless subsequently revoked as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ballot or revocation is not effective until received by the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association must give notice to owners of any action taken pursuant to this subsection within a reasonable time after the action is taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an action is taken pursuant to this subsection, a record of the action, including the ballots or a report of the persons appointed to tabulate such ballots, must be kept with the minutes of meetings of the association.</p>

<li>
<p>This section applies to lessees as if they were owners;</p>
</li>
<li>
