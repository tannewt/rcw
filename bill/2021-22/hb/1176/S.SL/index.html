When the <strong>student</strong> and parent or guardian are unable to pay for the damages, the school district shall provide a program of <strong>community service</strong> for the <strong>student</strong> in lieu of the payment of monetary damages. Upon completion of <strong>community service</strong> the  diploma of the <strong>student must</strong> be released. The parent or guardian of <strong>the student</strong> shall be liable for damages as otherwise provided by law.</p>

<p>Before <strong>the diploma is withheld</strong> under this section, a school district board of directors shall adopt procedures which insure that <strong>students'</strong> rights to due process are protected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department of social and health services or a child-placing agency licensed by the department has been granted custody of a child, that child's records, if requested by the department or agency, are not to be withheld for nonpayment of school fees or any other reason.</p>
