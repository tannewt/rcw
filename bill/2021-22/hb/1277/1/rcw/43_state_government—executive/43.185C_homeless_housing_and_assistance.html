<p>Despite laudable efforts by all levels of government, private individuals, nonprofit organizations, and charitable foundations to end homelessness, the number of homeless persons in Washington is unacceptably high. The state's homeless population, furthermore, includes a large number of families with children, youth, and employed persons. The legislature finds that the fiscal and societal costs of homelessness are high for both the public and private sectors, and that ending homelessness should be a goal for state and local government.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that there are many causes of homelessness, including a shortage of affordable housing; a shortage of family-wage jobs which undermines housing affordability; a lack of an accessible and affordable health care system available to all who suffer from physical and mental illnesses and chemical and alcohol dependency; domestic violence; and a lack of education and job skills necessary to acquire adequate wage jobs in the economy of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The support and commitment of all sectors of the statewide community is critical to the chances of success in ending homelessness in Washington. While the provision of housing and housing-related services to the homeless should be administered at the local level to best address specific community needs, the legislature also recognizes the need for the state to play a primary coordinating, supporting, and monitoring role. There must be a clear assignment of responsibilities and a clear statement of achievable and quantifiable goals. Systematic statewide data collection on homelessness in Washington must be a critical component of such a program enabling the state to work with local governments to count homeless persons and assist them in finding housing.</p>
<p>The systematic collection and rigorous evaluation of homeless data, a search for and implementation through adequate resource allocation of best practices, and the systematic measurement of progress toward interim goals and the ultimate goal of ending homelessness are all necessary components of a statewide effort to end homelessness in Washington by July 1, 2015.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall, in consultation with the interagency council on homelessness, the affordable housing advisory board, and the state advisory council on homelessness, prepare and publish a five-year homeless housing strategic plan which must outline statewide goals and performance measures. The state homeless housing strategic plan must be submitted to the legislature by July 1, 2019, and every five years thereafter. The plan must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Performance measures and goals to reduce homelessness, including long-term and short-term goals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An analysis of the services and programs being offered at the state and county level and an identification of those representing best practices and outcomes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognition of services and programs targeted to certain homeless populations or geographic areas in recognition of the diverse needs across the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New or innovative funding, program, or service strategies to pursue;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An implementation strategy outlining the roles and responsibilities at the state and local level and timelines to achieve a reduction in homelessness at the statewide level during periods of the five-year homeless housing strategic plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must coordinate its efforts on the state homeless housing strategic plan with the office of homeless youth prevention and protection programs advisory committee under RCW 43.330.705. The state homeless housing strategic plan must not conflict with the strategies, planning, data collection, and performance and outcome measures developed under RCW 43.330.705 and 43.330.706 to reduce the state's homeless youth population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To guide local governments in preparation of local homeless housing plans due December 1, 2019, the department shall issue by December 1, 2018, guidelines consistent with this chapter and including the best available data on each community's homeless population. Program outcomes, performance measures, and goals must be created by the department in collaboration with local governments against which state and local governments' performance will be measured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop a consistent statewide data gathering instrument to monitor the performance of cities and counties receiving grants in order to determine compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the grant application or required by the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The department shall, in consultation with the interagency council on homelessness and the affordable housing advisory board, report biennially to the governor and the appropriate committees of the legislature an assessment of the state's performance in furthering the goals of the state five-year homeless housing strategic plan and the performance of each participating local government in creating and executing a local homeless housing plan which meets the requirements of this chapter. To increase the effectiveness of the report, the department must develop a process to ensure consistent presentation, analysis, and explanation in the report, including year-to-year comparisons, highlights of program successes and challenges, and information that supports recommended strategy or operational changes. The report may include performance measures such as:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The reduction in the number of homeless individuals and families from the initial count of homeless persons;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reduction in the number of unaccompanied homeless youth. &quot;Unaccompanied homeless youth&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 43.330.702;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of new units available and affordable for homeless families by housing type;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of homeless individuals identified who are not offered suitable housing within thirty days of their request or identification as homeless;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of households at risk of losing housing who maintain it due to a preventive intervention;</p>
</li>

<p>The ability to successfully collect data and report performance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent of collaboration and coordination among public bodies, as well as community stakeholders, and the level of community support and participation;</p>

<li>
<p>The quality and safety of housing provided; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effectiveness of outreach to homeless persons, and their satisfaction with the program.</p>

<li>
<p>Only a local government is eligible to receive a homeless housing grant from the *homeless housing account. Any city may assert responsibility for homeless housing within its borders if it so chooses, by forwarding a resolution to the legislative authority of the county stating its intention and its commitment to operate a separate homeless housing program. The city shall then receive a percentage of the surcharge assessed under RCW 36.22.179 equal to the percentage of the city's local portion of the real estate excise tax collected by the county. A participating city may also then apply separately for homeless housing program grants. A city choosing to operate a separate homeless housing program shall be responsible for complying with all of the same requirements as counties and shall adopt a local homeless housing plan meeting the requirements of this chapter for county local plans. However, the city may by resolution of its legislative authority accept the county's homeless housing task force as its own and based on that task force's recommendations adopt a homeless housing plan specific to the city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local governments applying for homeless housing funds may subcontract with any other local government, housing authority, community action agency or other nonprofit organization for the execution of programs contributing to the overall goal of ending homelessness within a defined service area. All subcontracts shall be consistent with the local homeless housing plan adopted by the legislative authority of the local government, time limited, and filed with the department and shall have specific performance terms. While a local government has the authority to subcontract with other entities, the local government continues to maintain the ultimate responsibility for the homeless housing program within its borders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county may decline to participate in the program authorized in this chapter by forwarding to the department a resolution adopted by the county legislative authority stating the intention not to participate. A copy of the resolution shall also be transmitted to the county auditor and treasurer. If such a resolution is adopted, all of the funds otherwise due to the county under RCW 43.185C.060 shall be remitted monthly to the state treasurer for deposit in the *homeless housing account, without any reduction by the county for collecting or administering the funds. Upon receipt of the resolution, the department shall promptly begin to identify and contract with one or more entities eligible under this section to create and execute a local homeless housing plan for the county meeting the requirements of this chapter. The department shall expend all of the funds received from the county under this subsection to carry out the purposes of chapter 484, Laws of 2005 in the county, provided that the department may retain six percent of these funds to offset the cost of managing the county's program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A resolution by the county declining to participate in the program shall have no effect on the ability of each city in the county to assert its right to manage its own program under this chapter, and the county shall monthly transmit to the city the funds due under this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>The eviction prevention rental assistance program is created in the department to prevent evictions by providing resources to households most likely to become homeless or suffer severe health consequences, or both, after an eviction, while promoting equity by prioritizing households, including communities of color, disproportionately impacted by public health emergencies and by homelessness and housing instability. The department must provide grants to eligible organizations, as described in RCW 43.185.060, to provide assistance to program participants. The eligible organizations must use grant moneys for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Rental assistance, including rental arrears and future rent if needed to stabilize the applicant's housing and prevent their eviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utility assistance for households if needed to prevent an eviction; and</p>

Upon request by an eligible grantee or the county or city in which it exists, the department must provide a list of organizations that serve and are substantially governed by marginalized populations, if known.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Transport the child to his or her home or to a parent at his or her place of employment, if no parent is at home. The parent may request that the officer take the child to the home of an adult extended family member, responsible adult, crisis residential center, the department of children, youth, and families, or a licensed youth shelter. In responding to the request of the parent, the officer shall take the child to a requested place which, in the officer's belief, is within a reasonable distance of the parent's home. The officer releasing a child into the custody of a parent, an adult extended family member, responsible adult, or a licensed youth shelter shall inform the person receiving the child of the reason for taking the child into custody and inform all parties of the nature and location of appropriate services available in the community; or</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After attempting to notify the parent, if a crisis residential center is full, not available, or not located within a reasonable distance, request the department of children, youth, and families to accept custody of the child. If the department of children, youth, and families determines that an appropriate placement is currently available, the department of children, youth, and families shall accept custody and place the child in an out-of-home placement. Upon accepting custody of a child from the officer, the department of children, youth, and families may place the child in an out-of-home placement for up to seventy-two hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, without filing a child in need of services petition, obtaining parental consent, or obtaining an order for placement under chapter 13.34 RCW. Upon transferring a child to the department of children, youth, and families' custody, the officer shall provide written documentation of the reasons and the statutory basis for taking the child into custody. If the department of children, youth, and families declines to accept custody of the child, the officer may release the child after attempting to take the child to the following, in the order listed: The home of an adult extended family member; a responsible adult; or a licensed youth shelter. The officer shall immediately notify the department of children, youth, and families if no placement option is available and the child is released.</p>

<li>
<p>An officer taking a child into custody under RCW 43.185C.260(1)(c) shall inform the child of the reason for custody. An officer taking a child into custody under RCW 43.185C.260(1)(c) may release the child to the supervising agency, may return the child to the placement authorized by the supervising agency, or shall take the child to a designated crisis residential center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every officer taking a child into custody shall provide the child and his or her parent or parents or responsible adult with a copy of the statement specified in RCW 43.185C.290(6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever an officer transfers custody of a child to a crisis residential center or the department of children, youth, and families, the child may reside in the crisis residential center or may be placed by the department of children, youth, and families in an out-of-home placement for an aggregate total period of time not to exceed seventy-two hours excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Thereafter, the child may continue in out-of-home placement only if the parents have consented, a child in need of services petition has been filed, or an order for placement has been entered under chapter 13.34 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of children, youth, and families shall ensure that all law enforcement authorities are informed on a regular basis as to the location of all designated secure and semi-secure facilities within centers in their jurisdiction, where children taken into custody under RCW 43.185C.260 may be taken.</p>

<li>
<p>At no time shall information regarding a parent's or child's rights be withheld. The department shall develop and distribute to all law enforcement agencies and to each crisis residential center administrator a written statement delineating the services and rights. The administrator of the facility or his or her designee shall provide every resident and parent with a copy of the statement.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Notification requirements that meet the notification requirements of chapter 13.32A RCW. The youth's arrival date and time must be logged at intake by HOPE center staff. The staff must immediately notify law enforcement and dependency caseworkers if a street youth runs away from a HOPE center. A child may be transferred to a secure facility as defined in RCW 13.32A.030 whenever the staff reasonably believes that a street youth is likely to leave the HOPE center and not return after full consideration of the factors set forth in RCW 43.185C.290(2)(a) (i) and (ii). The street youth's temporary placement in the HOPE center must be authorized by the court or the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families if the youth is a dependent of the state under chapter 13.34 RCW or the department of children, youth, and families is responsible for the youth under chapter 13.32A RCW, or by the youth's parent or legal custodian, until such time as the parent can retrieve the youth who is returning to home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOPE centers must identify to the department of children, youth, and families any street youth it serves who is not returning promptly to home. The department of children, youth, and families then must contact the missing children's clearinghouse identified in chapter 13.60 RCW and either report the youth's location or report that the youth is the subject of a dependency action and the parent should receive notice from the department of children, youth, and families; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services that provide counseling and education to the street youth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall award contracts for the operation of HOPE center beds with the goal of facilitating the coordination of services provided for youth by such programs and those services provided by secure and semi-secure crisis residential centers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated for this purpose, the department must incrementally increase the number of available HOPE beds by at least seventeen beds in fiscal year 2017, at least seventeen beds in fiscal year 2018, and at least seventeen beds in fiscal year 2019, such that by July 1, 2019, seventy-five HOPE beds are established and operated throughout the state as set forth in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated for this purpose, the beds available in HOPE centers shall be increased incrementally. The additional capacity shall be distributed around the state based upon need and, to the extent feasible, shall be geographically situated so that HOPE beds are available across the state. In determining the need for increased numbers of HOPE beds in a particular county or counties, one of the considerations should be the volume of truancy petitions filed there.</p>

<p>The eviction prevention rental assistance program is created in the department to prevent evictions by providing resources to households most likely to become homeless or suffer severe health consequences, or both, after an eviction, while promoting equity by prioritizing households, including communities of color, disproportionately impacted by public health emergencies and by homelessness and housing instability. The department must provide grants to eligible organizations, as described in RCW 43.185.060, to provide assistance to program participants. The eligible organizations must use grant moneys for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Rental assistance, including rental arrears and future rent if needed to stabilize the applicant's housing and prevent their eviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utility assistance for households if needed to prevent an eviction; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative costs of the eligible organization, which must not exceed limits prescribed by the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Households eligible to receive assistance through the eviction prevention rental assistance program are those:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>With incomes at or below 80 percent of the county area median income;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are families with children, living in doubled up situations, young adults, senior citizens, and others at risk of homelessness or significant physical or behavioral health complications from homelessness; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That meet any other eligibility requirements as established by the department after consultation with stakeholder groups, including persons at risk of homelessness due to unpaid rent, representatives of communities of color, homeless service providers, landlord representatives, local governments that administer homelessness assistance, a statewide association representing cities, a statewide association representing counties, and affordable housing advocates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible grantees must actively work with organizations rooted in communities of color to assist and serve marginalized populations within their communities. At least 10 percent of the grant total must be subgranted to organizations that serve and are substantially governed by marginalized populations to pay the costs associated with program outreach, assistance completing applications for assistance, and related costs. Upon request by an eligible grantee or the county or city in which it exists, the department must provide a list of organizations that serve and are substantially governed by marginalized populations, if known. If an eligible grantee is unable to subgrant with an organization that serves and is substantially governed by marginalized populations, the grantee may request an exemption from the subgrant requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must ensure equity by developing performance measures and benchmarks that promote both equitable program access and equitable program outcomes. Performance measures and benchmarks must be developed by the department in consultation with stakeholder groups, including persons at risk of homelessness due to unpaid rent, representatives of communities of color, homeless service providers, landlord representatives, local governments that administer homelessness assistance, a statewide association representing cities, a statewide association representing counties, and affordable housing advocates. Performance measures and benchmarks must also ensure that the race and ethnicity of households served under the program are proportional to the numbers of people at risk of homelessness in each county for each of the following groups:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Black or African American;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Indian and Alaska Native;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hispanic or Latinx;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asian;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other multiracial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may develop additional rules, requirements, procedures, and guidelines as necessary to implement and operate the eviction prevention rental assistance program.</p>
