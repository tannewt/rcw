</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature declares that the family unit is a fundamental resource of American life which should be nurtured. Toward the continuance of this principle, the legislature declares that the family unit should remain intact unless a child's right to conditions of basic nurture, health, or safety is jeopardized. When the rights of basic nurture, physical and mental health, and safety of the child and the legal rights of the parents are in conflict, the rights and safety of the child should prevail. In making reasonable efforts under this chapter, the child's health and safety shall be the paramount concern. The right of a child to basic nurturing includes the right to a safe, stable, and permanent home and a speedy resolution of any proceeding under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The best interests of the child are served when the existing pattern of interaction between a parent and child is altered only to the extent necessitated by the changed relationship of the parents or as required to protect the child from physical, mental, or emotional harm. If a parent is unable to provide conditions of basic nurture, health, or safety as a primary caregiver and faces termination of parental rights under this chapter, but is otherwise capable of or may be capable of healthy visitation with the child, it is presumed that a written agreement under RCW 26.33.295 outlining ongoing visitation is in the child's best interests.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The legislature recognizes that many dependency and termination proceedings are rooted in a parent's untreated substance use or mental health challenges, or both. Mental health conditions and substance use disorders are treatable brain diseases from which people can and do recover. Even though a parent might currently be unable to serve as a primary caregiver and faces termination of parental rights under this chapter, the legislature recognizes that the parent can recover from his or her behavioral health challenges and, in doing so, can become able to participate in his or her child's life in a meaningful way. There is no such thing as too many people loving a child, and a child's development is aided, not hindered, by the presence of multiple, caring adults.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The legislature recognizes that trauma caused by unnecessary separation of parents and infants during the critical period of bonding immediately following birth should involve active efforts by the department when possible to engage these parents and actively provide services to prevent the separation of a child from the child's parents. For children born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, hospitals and child welfare services must work together to ensure that evidence-based best practices are followed, including keeping the birth mother and child together whenever possible to reduce reliance on pharmacological interventions for neonatal abstinence syndrome.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To maintain consistency and promote good outcomes for children and families, courts are encouraged to assign the same judicial officer to a child welfare court case for the duration of that case.</strong></p>

<p>The allegation under RCW 13.34.180(3) is established beyond a reasonable doubt. In determining whether RCW 13.34.180(1) (e) and (f) are established beyond a reasonable doubt, the court shall consider whether one or more of the aggravated circumstances listed in RCW 13.34.132 exist; or</p>

To rebut this presumption, the department must establish by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that such contact currently is not, and will never be, in the child's best interest.</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>There is a presumption that visitation between the child and parent whose rights have been terminated will continue or be reinstated pursuant to an open adoption agreement under RCW 26.33.295, unless the contact is no longer, and will never be, in the child's best interest. If visitation is not currently in the child's best interest, the open adoption agreement in RCW 26.33.295 may include requirements for a birth parent to remedy challenges that led to the termination prior to reinstatement of visitation.</strong></p>

<p>If, upon entering an order terminating the parental rights of a parent, there remains no parent having parental rights, the court shall commit the child to the custody of the department willing to accept custody for the purpose of placing the child for adoption. If an adoptive home has not been identified, the department shall place the child in a licensed foster home, or take other suitable measures for the care and welfare of the child. The custodian shall have authority to consent to the adoption of the child consistent with chapter 26.33 RCW, the marriage of the child, the enlistment of the child in the armed forces of the United States, necessary surgical and other medical treatment for the child, and to consent to such other matters as might normally be required of the parent of the child.</p>
