<li>
<p>Students at institutions of higher education have the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press in school-sponsored media, whether or not the media are supported financially by the school or by use of school facilities, or are produced in conjunction with a class. All school-sponsored media produced primarily by students at an institution of higher education are public forums for expression by the student journalists and student editors at the particular institution. Student media, whether school-sponsored or nonschool sponsored, are not subject to mandatory prior review by school officials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student editors of school-sponsored media are responsible for determining the news, opinion, feature, and advertising content of the media. This subsection does not prevent a student media adviser from teaching professional standards of English and journalism to the student journalists. A student media adviser may not be terminated, transferred, removed, or otherwise disciplined for refusing to suppress the protected free expression rights of student journalists.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The violation of lawful school regulations, policies, or procedures; or</p>
</li>

<p>The material and substantial disruption of the orderly operation of the school. A school official must base a forecast of material and substantial disruption on specific facts, including past experience in the school and current events influencing student behavior, and not on undifferentiated fear or apprehension.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any student enrolled in an institution of higher education may commence a civil action to obtain appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief as determined by a court for a violation of subsection (1) of this section by the institution of higher education. Upon a motion, a court may award reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing plaintiff in a civil action brought under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expression made by students in school-sponsored media is not the expression of school policy. Neither a school official nor the governing board of any institution of higher education may be held responsible in any civil or criminal action for any expression made or published by students in school-sponsored media unless school officials or the governing board have interfered with or altered the content of the student expression.</p>

<p>By December 1, 2011, and by June of each odd-numbered year thereafter, the institutions of higher education shall collaboratively develop a master list of postsecondary courses that can be fulfilled by taking the advanced placement, international baccalaureate, or other recognized college-level proficiency examinations, including but not limited to examinations by a national multidisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics program, and meeting the qualifying examination score or demonstrated competencies for lower division general education requirements or postsecondary professional technical requirements. The master list of postsecondary courses fulfilled by proficiency examinations or demonstrated competencies are those that fulfill lower division general education requirements or career and technical education requirements and qualify for postsecondary credit. From the master list, each institution shall create and publish a list of its courses that can be satisfied by successful proficiency examination scores or demonstrated competencies for lower division general education requirements or postsecondary professional technical requirements. The qualifying examination scores and demonstrated competencies shall be included in the published list. The requirements to develop a master list under this section do not apply if an institution has a clearly published policy of awarding credit for the advanced placement, international baccalaureate, or other recognized college-level placement exams and does not require those credits to meet specific course requirements but generally applies those credits towards degree requirements.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Each institution of higher education, in designing its certificate, technical degree program, two-year academic transfer program, or first-year student and sophomore courses of a baccalaureate program or baccalaureate degree, must recognize the equivalencies of at least one year of course credit and maximize the application of the credits toward lower division general education requirements that can be earned through successfully demonstrating proficiency on examinations, including but not limited to advanced placement and international baccalaureate examinations. The successful completion of the examination and the award of credit shall be noted on the student's college transcript.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each institution of higher education must clearly include in its admissions materials and on its website the credits or the institution's list of postsecondary courses that can be fulfilled by proficiency examinations or demonstrated competencies and the agreed-upon examination scores and demonstrated competencies that qualify for postsecondary credit. Each institution must provide the information to the student achievement council and state board for community and technical colleges in a form that the superintendent of public instruction is able to distribute to school districts.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature that state universities engage in the commercialization of research and other economic development and workforce development activities that benefit the intermediate and long-term economic vitality of Washington. State universities are expected to develop and strengthen university-industry relationships through the conduct of research, the support of company formation and job generation, and collaborative training. The state universities, using a collaborative process that may include both in-house resources and independent contractors with necessary technical expertise or innovative processes, must perform one or more of the following functions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide collaborative research and technology transfer opportunities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publicize their commercialization processes and include an explanation of how to access commercialization resources at the universities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop mechanisms for pairing researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors. Such mechanisms are to include, but are not limited to, developing guides, websites, or workshops on funding opportunities, on entrepreneurship and the process of starting a company, and on university-industry relations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Host events to connect researchers to entrepreneurs, investors, and individuals from the state's technology-based industries; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate students through direct involvement in research and industry interactions.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the state of Washington that financial need not be a barrier to participation in higher education. It is also the policy of the state of Washington that the essential requirements level budget calculation include funding for state student financial aid programs. The calculation should, at a minimum, include a funding level equal to the amount provided in the second year of the previous biennium in the omnibus appropriations act, adjusted for the percentage of needy resident students, by educational sector, likely to be included in any enrollment increases necessary to maintain, by educational sector, the participation rate funded in the 1993 fiscal year. The calculation should also be adjusted to reflect, by educational sector, any increases in cost of attendance. The cost of attendance figures should be calculated by the office of financial management and provided to the appropriate legislative committees by June 30th of each even-numbered year.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual, firm, partnership or corporation specified in subsection (1) of this section may also require that, in addition to the requirements in subsection (2) of this section, the request include a statement signed by the student agreeing to both of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">

<li>
<p>He or she will not copy or duplicate the instructional material provided in specialized format for use by others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public or private institution of higher education that provides a specialized format version of instructional material pursuant to this section may not require that the student return the specialized format version of the instructional material, except that if the institution has determined that it is not required to allow the student to retain the material under the Americans with disabilities act or other applicable laws, and the material was translated or transcribed into a specialized format at the expense of the institution and the cost to reproduce a copy of the translation or transcription is greater than one hundred dollars, the institution may require that the student return the specialized format version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a public or private institution of higher education provides a student with the specialized format version of an instructional material, the media must be copy-protected or the public or private institution of higher education shall take other reasonable precautions to ensure that students do not copy or distribute specialized format versions of instructional materials in violation of the copyright revision act of 1976, as amended (17 U.S.C. Sec. 101 et seq.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Instructional material or materials&quot; means textbooks and other materials that are required or essential to a student's success in a postsecondary course of study in which a student with a disability is enrolled. The determination of which materials are &quot;required or essential to student success&quot; shall be made by the instructor of the course in consultation with the official making the request in accordance with guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (10) of this section. The term specifically includes both textual and nontextual information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Print access disability&quot; means a condition in which a person's independent reading of, reading comprehension of, or visual access to materials is limited or reduced due to a sensory, neurological, cognitive, physical, psychiatric, or other disability recognized by state or federal law. The term is applicable, but not limited to, persons who are blind, have low vision, or have reading disorders or physical disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Structural integrity&quot; means all instructional material, including but not limited to the text of the material, sidebars, the table of contents, chapter headings and subheadings, footnotes, indexes, glossaries, graphs, charts, illustrations, pictures, equations, formulas, and bibliographies. Structural order of material shall be maintained. Structural elements, such as headings, lists, and tables must be identified using current markup and tools. If good faith efforts fail to produce an agreement between the publisher or manufacturer and the public or private institution of higher education, as to an electronic format that will preserve the structural integrity of instructional materials, the publisher or manufacturer shall provide the instructional material in a verified and valid HTML format and shall preserve as much of the structural integrity of the instructional materials as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Specialized format&quot; means Braille, audio, or digital text that is exclusively for use by blind or other persons with print access disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section is to be construed to prohibit a public or private institution of higher education from assisting a student with a print access disability through the use of an electronic version of instructional material gained through this section or by transcribing or translating or arranging for the transcription or translation of the instructional material into specialized formats that provide persons with print access disabilities the ability to have increased independent access to instructional materials. If such specialized format is made, the public or private institution of higher education may share the specialized format version of the instructional material with other students with print access disabilities for whom the public or private institution of higher education is authorized to request electronic versions of instructional material. The addition of captioning to video material by a Washington public or private institution of higher education does not constitute an infringement of copyright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A specialized format version of instructional materials developed at one public or private institution of higher education in Washington state may be shared for use by a student at another public or private institution of higher education in Washington state for whom the latter public or private institution of higher education is authorized to request electronic versions of instructional material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize any use of instructional materials that would constitute an infringement of copyright under the copyright revision act of 1976, as amended (17 U.S.C. Sec. 101 et seq.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governing boards of public and participating private institutions of higher education in Washington state shall each adopt guidelines consistent with this section for its implementation and administration. At a minimum, the guidelines shall address all of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The designation of materials deemed &quot;required or essential to student success&quot;;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The determination of the availability of technology for the conversion of materials pursuant to subsection (5) of this section and the conversion of mathematics and science materials pursuant to subsection (6)(c) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedures and standards relating to distribution of files and materials pursuant to this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guidelines shall include procedures for granting exceptions when it is determined that an individual, firm, partnership or corporation that publishes or manufactures instructional materials is not technically able to comply with the requirements of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other matters as are deemed necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A violation of this chapter constitutes an unfair practice under chapter 49.60 RCW, the law against discrimination. All rights and remedies under chapter 49.60 RCW, including the right to file a complaint with the human rights commission and to bring a civil action, apply.</p>
