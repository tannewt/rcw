<p>Washington state has the fewest housing units per household in the nation according to a presentation by the lieutenant governor. The permitting of buildings is one area that has been identified as a hindrance to increasing the number of housing units in Washington state. The legislature finds that streamlining the processing of building permits is a powerful way to combat the lack of housing in this state.</p>
