<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington has a historic budget surplus due to rising revenue forecasts, federal spending on pandemic-related relief, and lower enrollments and caseloads. The legislature finds that it can provide tax relief without jeopardizing important government services, and that the current inflationary environment justifies doing so at this time. According to the United States bureau of labor statistics, Washington state inflation exceeded the national average over the last year at 6.5 percent, relative to 6.2 percent nationally. Food prices were up 7.9 percent, including a 22 percent increase in the price of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. Energy prices and gas prices are up, impacting both consumers and producers. In November of 2021, inflation rose at the fastest pace since 1982. Economist Milton Friedman is reported to have said &quot;inflation is taxation without legislation.&quot; Inflation is also a tax that is highly regressive, falling harder on the poor than the wealthy, because low-income people are more likely to rent their homes and therefore less likely to benefit from price gains in hard assets that occur in an inflationary environment. The legislature finds that state tax policy should respond to this mix of historic budget surplus and historic levels of inflation that is eroding the purchasing power of working families. Therefore, the legislature intends to cut taxes on the producers of consumer goods and key supply chain industries so they can pass along cost savings to consumers and make capital investments to increase their output, which will reduce prices through increased supply.</p>

<p>(B) The denominator of the fraction is the total taxable amount subject to the tax imposed under all manufacturing classifications in chapter 82.04 RCW.</p>
<p>(C) For purposes of both the numerator and denominator of the fraction, the total taxable amount refers to the total taxable amount required to be reported on the person's returns for the calendar year before the calendar year in which the credit under this section is earned. The department may provide for an alternative method for calculating the numerator in cases where the tax rate provided in RCW 82.04.260(10) for manufacturing was not in effect during the full calendar year before the calendar year in which the credit under this section is earned.</p>
<p>(D) No credit is available under (b)(i)(A) or (B) of this subsection (2) if either the numerator or the denominator of the fraction is zero. If the fraction is greater than or equal to nine-tenths, then the fraction is rounded to one.</p>
