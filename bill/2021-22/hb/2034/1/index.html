<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Since the creation of Washington state's juvenile courts, individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses have received differing degrees of legal protections related to their juvenile records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As legal protections for juvenile records expanded and contracted under different Washington legislatures, juvenile records and information related to those records have been disseminated in ways that hinder individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses from effective reintegration and harm those individuals whose protected information has been shared without recourse or accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To remedy barriers created by the release of juvenile records and information related to those records, the legislature intends to emphasize that former individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses can seek relief for harm caused by violations of this chapter and grant individuals the right to monetary damages for violations of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide Washington youth with the finality necessary to effectively protect their records, the legislature further intends to create a process that allows rehabilitated former individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses the right to destroy juvenile records and information related to those records.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-142">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-142">¶</a></h2>

<p>The court shall hold regular sealing hearings. During these regular sealing hearings, the court shall administratively seal an individual's juvenile record pursuant to the requirements of this subsection.
