<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Since the creation of Washington state's juvenile courts, youth adjudicated of juvenile offenses have received differing degrees of legal protections related to their juvenile records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As legal protections for juvenile records expanded and contracted under different Washington legislatures, juvenile records and information related to those records have been disseminated in ways that hinder individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses from effective reintegration and harm those individuals whose protected information has been shared without recourse or accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To remedy barriers created by the release of juvenile records and information related to those records, the legislature intends to emphasize that former individuals adjudicated of juvenile offenses can seek relief for harm caused by violations of this chapter and grant individuals the right to monetary damages for violations of this chapter.</p>

<p>The court shall hold regular sealing hearings. During these regular sealing hearings, the court shall administratively seal an individual's juvenile record pursuant to the requirements of this subsection. Although the juvenile record shall be sealed, the social file may be available to any juvenile justice or care agency when an investigation or case involving the juvenile subject of the records is being prosecuted by the juvenile justice or care agency or when the juvenile justice or care agency is assigned the responsibility of supervising the juvenile. The juvenile respondent's presence is not required at any administrative sealing hearing.</p>
