<li>
<p>A plan for periodic testing of newly installed smoke control systems is required as part of the construction documents for new smoke control systems. The engineer of record for the smoke control system shall prepare the periodic test plan. The plan must specify the procedures and methods to be used, the items subject to the inspections and tests, and the frequency the inspections and tests are to be implemented. This plan must be stored on the site and provided to the local authority upon request.</p>

<p>A special inspector for periodic testing must be identified to perform or coordinate the special inspections during periodic testing. The special inspector for periodic testing may also serve as the integrated testing agent as stated in the national fire protection administration standard number 4, standard for integrated fire protection and life safety system testing, when smoke control testing is performed as part of integrated systems testing at the time of installation or periodic operational testing. The special inspector for periodic testing may also coordinate testing, assemble test reports and documentation, and provide these to the local authority upon request.</p>
