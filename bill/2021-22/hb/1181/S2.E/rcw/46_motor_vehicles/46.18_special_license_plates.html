<p>The legislature has seen an increase in the demand from constituent groups seeking recognition and funding through the establishment of commemorative or special license plates. The high cost of implementing a new special license plate series coupled with the uncertainty of the state's ability to recoup its costs has led the legislature to delay the implementation of new special license plates. In order to address these issues, it is the intent of the legislature to create a mechanism that will allow for the evaluation of special license plate requests and establish a funding policy that will alleviate the financial burden currently placed on the state. Using these two strategies, the legislature will be better equipped to efficiently process special license plate legislation.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The organization sponsoring the license plate series shall, within thirty days of enactment of the legislation creating the special license plate series, submit prepayment of all start-up costs associated with the creation and implementation of the special license plate in an amount determined by the department.
