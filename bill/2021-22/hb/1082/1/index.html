<li>
<p>The procedures governing adjudicative proceedings before agencies under chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act, govern hearings before the commission and govern all other actions before the commission unless otherwise provided in this chapter. The standard of proof in actions before the commission is <strong>a preponderance of the</strong> evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all hearings requested under RCW 43.101.155 , <strong>an administrative law judge appointed under chapter 34.12 RCW shall be the presiding officer, shall make all necessary rulings in the course of the hearing, and shall issue a proposed recommendation, but is not entitled to vote. In addition,</strong> a <strong>three-member</strong> hearings panel shall  hear the case and make the commission's final administrative decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall appoint <strong>a panel</strong> to hear certification actions <strong>as follows</strong>:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>When a hearing is requested in relation to a certification action of a Washington peace officer , the commission shall appoint to the panel: (i) One police chief<strong>or</strong> sheriff <strong>from an agency not a current or past employer of the peace officer</strong>; (ii) <strong>one civilian member of the commission as appointed under RCW 43.101.030(1) (f) through (h); and (iii) one person with expertise and background in police accountability who is not a current or former peace officer or corrections officer</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>b.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When a hearing is requested in relation to a certification action of a Washington corrections officer, the commission shall appoint to the panel: (i) <strong>A person who heads</strong> either a city or county corrections agency or facility or of a Washington state department of corrections facility; (ii) <strong>one civilian member of the commission as appointed under RCW 43.101.030(1) (f) through (h)</strong>; and (iii) one person <strong>with expertise and background in police accountability</strong> who is not  a <strong>current or former peace officer or</strong> corrections officer .</p>
<pre><code>c. When a hearing is requested in relation to a certification action of a tribal police officer, the commission shall appoint to the panel (i)  one tribal police chief; (ii) **one civilian member of the commission as appointed under RCW 43.101.030(1) (f) through (h); and (iii) one person with expertise and background in police accountability who is not a current or former peace officer or corrections officer**.

d. Persons appointed to hearings panels by the commission shall, in relation to any certification action on which they sit, have the powers, duties, and immunities, and are entitled to the emoluments, including travel expenses in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060, of regular commission members.

<li>
<p><strong>In decertification matters where there was a criminal hearing, a due process hearing, a disciplinary appeals hearing,**<strong>or a finding entered by a law enforcement agency following an investigation,</strong> the hearings panel need not redetermine the underlying facts but may make <strong>its</strong> determination based solely on review of the records and decision relating to <strong>those</strong> proceeding</strong>s and any investigative or summary materials from the administrative law judge, legal counsel, and commission staff**. However, the hearings panel may, in its discretion, consider additional evidence to determine whether <strong>misconduct</strong> occurred . The hearings panel shall, upon written request by the subject peace officer or corrections officer, allow the peace officer or corrections officer to present additional evidence of extenuating circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The commission is authorized to proceed regardless of whether an arbitrator or other appellate decision maker overturns the discipline imposed by the officer's employing agency or whether the agency settles an appeal. No action or failure to act by a law enforcement agency or corrections agency or decision resulting from an appeal of that action precludes action by the commission to suspend or revoke an officer's certificate or to require remedial training for the officer.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The hearings, but not the deliberations of the hearings panel, are open to the public. The transcripts, admitted evidence, and written decisions of the hearings panel on behalf of the commission are not confidential or exempt from public disclosure, and are subject to subpoena and discovery proceedings in civil actions.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summary records of hearing dispositions must be made available on an annual basis on a public website.</strong></p>
