<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That Washington possesses an abundance of natural wealth in the form of forests, mountains, wildlife, waters, and other natural resources, all of which help to provide an unparalleled diversity of outdoor recreation opportunities and a quality of life unmatched in this nation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That as the state's population grows, the demand on these resources is growing too, placing greater stress on today's already overcrowded public recreational lands and facilities, and resulting in a significant loss of wildlife habitat and lands of unique natural value;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That public acquisition and development programs have not kept pace with the state's expanding population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That private investment and employment opportunities in general and the tourist industry in particular are dependent upon the continued availability of recreational opportunities and our state's unique natural environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That if current trends continue, some wildlife species and rare ecosystems will be lost in the state forever and public recreational lands will not be adequate to meet public demands;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That there is accordingly a need for the people of the state to reserve certain areas of the state, in rural as well as urban settings, for the benefit of present and future generations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is therefore the policy of the state to acquire as soon as possible the most significant lands for wildlife conservation and outdoor recreation purposes before they are converted to other uses, and to develop existing public recreational land and facilities to meet the needs of present and future generations.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The farm and forest account is established in the state treasury. The board will administer the account in accordance with chapter 79A.25 RCW and this chapter, and hold it separate and apart from all other money, funds, and accounts of the board. Moneys appropriated for this chapter to the farm and forest account must be distributed for the acquisition and preservation of farmlands and forestlands in order to maintain the opportunity for agricultural and forest management activity upon these lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys appropriated beginning July 1, 2016, for this chapter shall be divided as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Not less than ninety percent for the acquisition and preservation of farmlands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not less than ten percent for the acquisition and preservation of forestlands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys appropriated for this chapter to the farm and forest account may be distributed for: (a) The acquisition of a less than fee simple interest in farmlands or forestland, such as a conservation easement or lease; (b) the enhancement or restoration of ecological functions on those properties; or (c) both. In order for a farmland or forestland preservation grant to provide for an environmental enhancement or restoration project, the project must include the acquisition of a real property interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities, counties, nonprofit nature conservancies, and the conservation commission may apply for acquisition and enhancement or restoration funds for farmland or forestland preservation projects within their jurisdictions under subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may adopt rules establishing acquisition and enhancement or restoration policies and priorities for distributions from the farm and forest account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The acquisition of a property interest in a project under this section does not provide a right of access to the property by the public unless explicitly provided for in a conservation easement or other form of deed restriction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 79A.15.030(8), moneys appropriated for this section may not be used by the board to fund staff positions or other overhead expenses, or by cities, counties, nonprofit nature conservancies, or the conservation commission to fund operation or maintenance of areas acquired under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys appropriated for this section may be used by grant recipients for costs incidental to restoration and acquisition, including, but not limited to, surveying expenses, fencing, noxious weed control, and signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may not approve a local project where the local agency's or nonprofit nature conservancies' share is less than the amount to be awarded from the farm and forest account. In-kind contributions, including contributions of a real property interest in land, may be used to satisfy the local agency's or nonprofit nature conservancies' share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the acquisition priorities for farmland projects, the board must consider, at a minimum, the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Community support for the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recommendation as part of a limiting factors or critical pathways analysis, a watershed plan or habitat conservation plan, or a coordinated regionwide prioritization effort;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The likelihood of the conversion of the site to nonagricultural or more highly developed usage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistency with a local land use plan, or a regional or statewide recreational or resource plan. The projects that assist in the implementation of local shoreline master plans updated according to RCW 90.58.080 or local comprehensive plans updated according to RCW 36.70A.130 must be highly considered in the process;</p>
