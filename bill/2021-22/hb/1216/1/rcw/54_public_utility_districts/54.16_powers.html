<p>Whenever any land against which there has been levied any special assessment by any public utility district shall have been sold in part or subdivided, the board of commissioners of such public utility district shall have the power to order a segregation of the assessment.</p>
<p>Any person owning any part of the land involved in a special assessment and desiring to have such special assessment against the tracts of land segregated to apply to smaller parts thereof shall apply in writing to the board of commissioners of the public utility district which levied the assessment. If the commissioners determine that a segregation should be made they shall do so as nearly as possible on the same basis as the original assessment was levied and the total of the segregated parts of the assessment shall equal the assessment before segregation.</p>
<p>The commission shall then send notice thereof by mail to the several owners interested in the tract, as shown on the general tax rolls. If no protest is filed within twenty days from date of mailing said notice, the commission shall then by resolution approve said segregation. If a protest is filed, the commission shall have a hearing thereon, after mailing to the several owners at least ten days notice of the time and place thereof. After the hearing, the commission may by resolution approve said segregation, with or without change. Within ten days after the approval, any person aggrieved by the segregation may perfect an appeal to the superior court of the county wherein the property is situated and thereafter seek appellate review, all as provided for appeals from assessments levied by cities of the first class. The resolution approving said segregation shall describe the original tract, the amount and date of the original assessment, and shall define the boundaries of the divided parts and the amount of the assessment chargeable to each part, and shall order the county treasurer to make segregation on the original assessment roll as directed in the resolution. A certified copy of the resolution shall be delivered to the county treasurer who shall proceed to make the segregation ordered. The board of commissioners may require as a condition to the order of segregation that the person seeking it pay the public utility district the reasonable engineering and clerical costs incident to making the segregation. Unless otherwise provided in said resolution, the county treasurer shall apportion amounts paid on the original assessment in the same proportion as the segregated assessments bear to the original assessment. Upon segregation being made by the county treasurer, as aforesaid, the lien of the special assessment shall apply to the segregated parcels only to the extent of the segregated part of such assessment.</p>

<p>Any district is hereby authorized, within limits established by the Constitution of the state of Washington, to assist the owners of structures or equipment in financing the acquisition and installation of materials and equipment, for compensation or otherwise, for the conservation or more efficient use of energy in such structures or equipment pursuant to an energy conservation plan adopted by the district if the cost per unit of energy saved or produced by the use of such materials and equipment is less than the cost per unit of energy produced by the next least costly new energy resource which the district could acquire to meet future demand. Any financing authorized under this chapter shall only be used for conservation purposes in existing structures, and such financing shall not be used for any purpose which results in a conversion from one energy source to another. For the purposes of this section, &quot;conservation purposes in existing structures&quot; may include projects to allow a district's customers to generate all or a portion of their own electricity through the on-site installation of a distributed electricity generation system that uses as its fuel solar, wind, geothermal, or hydropower, or other renewable resource that is available on-site and not from a commercial source. Such projects shall not be considered &quot;a conversion from one energy source to another&quot; which is limited to the change or substitution of one commercial energy supplier for another commercial energy supplier. Except where otherwise authorized, such assistance shall be limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Providing an inspection of the structure or equipment, either directly or through one or more inspectors under contract, to determine and inform the owner of the estimated cost of purchasing and installing conservation materials and equipment for which financial assistance will be approved and the estimated life-cycle savings in energy costs that are likely to result from the installation of such materials or equipment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a list of businesses who sell and install such materials and equipment within or in close proximity to the service area of the district, each of which businesses shall have requested to be included and shall have the ability to provide the products in a workmanlike manner and to utilize such materials in accordance with the prevailing national standard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arranging to have approved conservation materials and equipment installed by a private contractor whose bid is acceptable to the owner of the residential structure and verifying such installation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arranging or providing financing for the purchase and installation of approved conservation materials and equipment. Such materials and equipment shall be purchased from a private business and shall be installed by a private business or the owner; and</p>

<p>The legislature encourages any public utility district to assist their customers in the acquisition and installation of materials and equipment, for compensation or otherwise, for the conservation or more efficient use of energy including, but not limited to, materials and equipment installed as part of a utility cool roof program. The use of appropriate tree plantings for energy conservation is highly encouraged as part of these programs. It is the policy of the state of Washington that any tree planting program engaged in by a public utility district where energy reduction is a goal as part of a broader energy conservation program under this chapter should accomplish the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reduce the peak-load demand for electricity in residential and commercial business areas during the summer months through direct shading of buildings provided by strategically planted trees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce wintertime demand for energy in residential areas by blocking cold winds from reaching homes, which lowers interior temperatures and drives heating demand;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect public health by removing harmful pollution from the air and prioritize in communities with environmental health disparities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilize the natural photosynthetic and transpiration process of trees to lower ambient temperatures and absorb carbon dioxide;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower electric bills for residential and commercial business ratepayers by limiting electricity consumption without reducing benefits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relieve financial and demand pressure on the utility that stems from large peak-load electricity demand;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protect water quality and public health by reducing and cooling stormwater runoff and keeping harmful pollutants from entering waterways, with special attention given to waterways vital for the preservation of threatened and endangered salmon;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that trees are planted in locations that limit the amount of public funding needed to maintain public and electric infrastructure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure program performance in terms of the estimated present value benefit per tree planted and equitable and accessible community engagement consistent with the department of health's environmental health disparities map recommendations 12 and 13, and with the community engagement plan guidance appendix C of the final report of the environmental justice task force established under chapter 415, Laws of 2019;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give special consideration to achieving environmental justice in goals and policies, avoid creating or worsening environmental health disparities, and make use of the department of health's environmental health disparities map to help guide engagement and actions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate with the department of natural resources urban and community forestry program's efforts to identify areas of need related to urban tree canopy and to provide technical assistance and capacity building to encourage urban tree canopy.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Notifies the utility of the inability to pay the bill, including a security deposit. This notice should be provided within five business days of receiving a payment overdue notice unless there are extenuating circumstances. If the customer fails to notify the utility within five business days and service is terminated, the customer can, by paying reconnection charges, if any, and fulfilling the requirements of this section, receive the protections of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides self-certification of household income for the prior twelve months to a grantee of the *department of community, trade, and economic development which administers federally funded energy assistance programs. The grantee shall determine that the household income does not exceed the maximum allowed for eligibility under the state's plan for low-income energy assistance under 42 U.S.C. 8624 and shall provide a dollar figure that is seven percent of household income. The grantee may verify information provided in the self-certification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has applied for home heating assistance from applicable government and private sector organizations and certifies that any assistance received will be applied to the current bill and future utility bills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has applied for low-income weatherization assistance to the utility or other appropriate agency if such assistance is available for the dwelling;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agrees to a payment plan and agrees to maintain the payment plan. The plan will be designed both to pay the past due bill by the following October 15 and to pay for continued utility service. If the past due bill is not paid by the following October 15, the customer shall not be eligible for protections under this chapter until the past due bill is paid. The plan shall not require monthly payments in excess of seven percent of the customer's monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter during November 15 through March 15. A customer may agree to pay a higher percentage during this period, but shall not be in default unless payment during this period is less than seven percent of monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter. If assistance payments are received by the customer subsequent to implementation of the plan, the customer shall contact the utility to reformulate the plan; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Be authorized to transfer an account to a new residence when a customer who has established a plan under this section moves from one residence to another within the same utility service area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be permitted to disconnect service if the customer fails to honor the payment program. Utilities may continue to disconnect service for those practices authorized by law other than for nonpayment as provided for in this section. Customers who qualify for payment plans under this section who default on their payment plans and are disconnected can be reconnected and maintain the protections afforded under this chapter by paying reconnection charges, if any, and by paying all amounts that would have been due and owing under the terms of the applicable payment plan, absent default, on the date on which service is reconnected; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise the customer in writing at the time it disconnects service that it will restore service if the customer contacts the utility and fulfills the other requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All districts providing utility service for residential space heating shall offer residential customers the option of a budget billing or equal payment plan. The budget billing or equal payment plan shall be offered low-income customers eligible under the state's plan for low-income energy assistance prepared in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 8624(C)(1) without limiting availability to certain months of the year, without regard to the length of time the customer has occupied the premises, and without regard to whether the customer is the tenant or owner of the premises occupied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agreement between the customer and the utility, whether oral or written, shall not waive the protections afforded under this chapter.</p>
