<p>It is the intent of the legislature to strengthen and consolidate disciplinary and licensure procedures for the licensed health and health-related professions and businesses by providing a uniform disciplinary act with standardized procedures for the licensure of health care professionals and the enforcement of laws the purpose of which is to assure the public of the adequacy of professional competence and conduct in the healing arts.</p>
<p>It is also the intent of the legislature that all health and health-related professions newly credentialed by the state come under the Uniform Disciplinary Act.</p>
<p>Further, the legislature declares that the addition of public members on all health care commissions and boards can give both the state and the public, which it has a statutory responsibility to protect, assurances of accountability and confidence in the various practices of health care.</p>

<p>Upon a finding, after hearing, that a license holder has committed unprofessional conduct or is unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety due to a physical or mental condition, the disciplining authority shall issue an order including sanctions adopted in accordance with the schedule adopted under RCW 18.130.390 giving proper consideration to any prior findings of fact under RCW 18.130.110, any stipulations to informal disposition under RCW 18.130.172, and any action taken by other in-state or out-of-state disciplining authorities. The order must provide for one or any combination of the following, as directed by the schedule, except as provided in RCW 9.97.020:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Revocation of the license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspension of the license for a fixed or indefinite term;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restriction or limitation of the practice;</p>

<li>
<p>The monitoring of the practice by a supervisor approved by the disciplining authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Censure or reprimand;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance with conditions of probation for a designated period of time;</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Any of the actions under this section may be totally or partly stayed by the disciplining authority. Safeguarding the public's health and safety is the paramount responsibility of every disciplining authority. In determining what action is appropriate, the disciplining authority must consider the schedule adopted under RCW 18.130.390. Where the schedule allows flexibility in determining the appropriate sanction, the disciplining authority must first consider what sanctions are necessary to protect or compensate the public. Only after such provisions have been made may the disciplining authority consider and include in the order requirements designed to rehabilitate the license holder. All costs associated with compliance with orders issued under this section are the obligation of the license holder. The disciplining authority may order permanent revocation of a license if it finds that the license holder can never be rehabilitated or can never regain the ability to practice with reasonable skill and safety.</p>
<p>Surrender or permanent revocation of a license under this section is not subject to a petition for reinstatement under RCW 18.130.150.</p>
<p>The disciplining authority may determine that a case presents unique circumstances that the schedule adopted under RCW 18.130.390 does not adequately address. The disciplining authority may deviate from the schedule adopted under RCW 18.130.390 when selecting appropriate sanctions, but the disciplining authority must issue a written explanation of the basis for not following the schedule.</p>
<p>The license holder may enter into a stipulated disposition of charges that includes one or more of the sanctions of this section, but only after a statement of charges has been issued and the license holder has been afforded the opportunity for a hearing and has elected on the record to forego such a hearing. The stipulation shall either contain one or more specific findings of unprofessional conduct or inability to practice, or a statement by the license holder acknowledging that evidence is sufficient to justify one or more specified findings of unprofessional conduct or inability to practice. The stipulation entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be considered formal disciplinary action for all purposes.</p>

<p>In investigating or adjudicating a complaint or report that a license holder may be unable to practice with reasonable skill or safety by reason of any mental or physical condition, the disciplining authority may require a license holder to submit to a mental or physical examination by one or more licensed or certified health professionals designated by the disciplining authority. The license holder shall be provided written notice of the disciplining authority's intent to order a mental or physical examination, which notice shall include: (i) A statement of the specific conduct, event, or circumstances justifying an examination; (ii) a summary of the evidence supporting the disciplining authority's concern that the license holder may be unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety by reason of a mental or physical condition, and the grounds for believing such evidence to be credible and reliable; (iii) a statement of the nature, purpose, scope, and content of the intended examination; (iv) a statement that the license holder has the right to respond in writing within twenty days to challenge the disciplining authority's grounds for ordering an examination or to challenge the manner or form of the examination; and (v) a statement that if the license holder timely responds to the notice of intent, then the license holder will not be required to submit to the examination while the response is under consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon submission of a timely response to the notice of intent to order a mental or physical examination, the license holder shall have an opportunity to respond to or refute such an order by submission of evidence or written argument or both. The evidence and written argument supporting and opposing the mental or physical examination shall be reviewed by either a panel of the disciplining authority members who have not been involved with the allegations against the license holder or a neutral decision maker approved by the disciplining authority. The reviewing panel of the disciplining authority or the approved neutral decision maker may, in its discretion, ask for oral argument from the parties. The reviewing panel of the disciplining authority or the approved neutral decision maker shall prepare a written decision as to whether: There is reasonable cause to believe that the license holder may be unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety by reason of a mental or physical condition, or the manner or form of the mental or physical examination is appropriate, or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt by the disciplining authority of the written decision, or upon the failure of the license holder to timely respond to the notice of intent, the disciplining authority may issue an order requiring the license holder to undergo a mental or physical examination. All such mental or physical examinations shall be narrowly tailored to address only the alleged mental or physical condition and the ability of the license holder to practice with reasonable skill and safety. An order of the disciplining authority requiring the license holder to undergo a mental or physical examination is not a final order for purposes of appeal. The cost of the examinations ordered by the disciplining authority shall be paid out of the health professions account. In addition to any examinations ordered by the disciplining authority, the license holder may submit physical or mental examination reports from licensed or certified health professionals of the license holder's choosing and expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the disciplining authority finds that a license holder has failed to submit to a properly ordered mental or physical examination, then the disciplining authority may order appropriate action or discipline under RCW 18.130.180(9), unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the person's control. However, no such action or discipline may be imposed unless the license holder has had the notice and opportunity to challenge the disciplining authority's grounds for ordering the examination, to challenge the manner and form, to assert any other defenses, and to have such challenges or defenses considered by either a panel of the disciplining authority members who have not been involved with the allegations against the license holder or a neutral decision maker approved by the disciplining authority, as previously set forth in this section. Further, the action or discipline ordered by the disciplining authority shall not be more severe than a suspension of the license, certification, registration, or application until such time as the license holder complies with the properly ordered mental or physical examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall restrict the power of a disciplining authority to act in an emergency under RCW 34.05.422(4), 34.05.479, and 18.130.050(8).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that a license holder is mentally incompetent or an individual with mental illness is presumptive evidence of the license holder's inability to practice with reasonable skill and safety. An individual affected under this section shall at reasonable intervals be afforded an opportunity, at his or her expense, to demonstrate that the individual can resume competent practice with reasonable skill and safety to the consumer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of subsection (2) of this section, a license holder governed by this chapter, by making application, practicing, or filing a license renewal, is deemed to have given consent to submit to a mental, physical, or psychological examination when directed in writing by the disciplining authority and further to have waived all objections to the admissibility or use of the examining health professional's testimony or examination reports by the disciplining authority on the ground that the testimony or reports constitute privileged communications.</p>

<ol>
<li>In lieu of disciplinary action under RCW 18.130.160 and if the disciplining authority determines that the unprofessional conduct may be the result of substance abuse, the disciplining authority may refer the license holder to a voluntary substance abuse monitoring program approved by the disciplining authority.</li>
</ol>
<p>The cost of the treatment shall be the responsibility of the license holder, but the responsibility does not preclude payment by an employer, existing insurance coverage, or other sources. Primary alcoholism or other drug addiction treatment shall be provided by approved treatment programs under *RCW 70.96A.020 or by any other provider approved by the entity or the commission. However, nothing shall prohibit the disciplining authority from approving additional services and programs as an adjunct to primary alcoholism or other drug addiction treatment. The disciplining authority may also approve the use of out-of-state programs. Referral of the license holder to the program shall be done only with the consent of the license holder. Referral to the program may also include probationary conditions for a designated period of time. If the license holder does not consent to be referred to the program or does not successfully complete the program, the disciplining authority may take appropriate action under RCW 18.130.160 which includes suspension of the license unless or until the disciplining authority, in consultation with the director of the voluntary substance abuse monitoring program, determines the license holder is able to practice safely. The secretary shall adopt uniform rules for the evaluation by the disciplining authority of a relapse or program violation on the part of a license holder in the substance abuse monitoring program. The evaluation shall encourage program participation with additional conditions, in lieu of disciplinary action, when the disciplining authority determines that the license holder is able to continue to practice with reasonable skill and safety.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In addition to approving substance abuse monitoring programs that may receive referrals from the disciplining authority, the disciplining authority may establish by rule requirements for participation of license holders who are not being investigated or monitored by the disciplining authority for substance abuse. License holders voluntarily participating in the approved programs without being referred by the disciplining authority shall not be subject to disciplinary action under RCW 18.130.160 for their substance abuse, and shall not have their participation made known to the disciplining authority, if they meet the requirements of this section and the program in which they are participating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The license holder shall sign a waiver allowing the program to release information to the disciplining authority if the licensee does not comply with the requirements of this section or is unable to practice with reasonable skill or safety. The substance abuse program shall report to the disciplining authority any license holder who fails to comply with the requirements of this section or the program or who, in the opinion of the program, is unable to practice with reasonable skill or safety. License holders shall report to the disciplining authority if they fail to comply with this section or do not complete the program's requirements. License holders may, upon the agreement of the program and disciplining authority, reenter the program if they have previously failed to comply with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treatment and pretreatment records of license holders referred to or voluntarily participating in approved programs shall be confidential, shall be exempt from chapter 42.56 RCW, and shall not be subject to discovery by subpoena or admissible as evidence except for monitoring records reported to the disciplining authority for cause as defined in subsection (3) of this section. Monitoring records relating to license holders referred to the program by the disciplining authority or relating to license holders reported to the disciplining authority by the program for cause, shall be released to the disciplining authority at the request of the disciplining authority. Records held by the disciplining authority under this section shall be exempt from chapter 42.56 RCW and shall not be subject to discovery by subpoena except by the license holder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Substance abuse,&quot; as used in this section, means the impairment, as determined by the disciplining authority, of a license holder's professional services by an addiction to, a dependency on, or the use of alcohol, legend drugs, or controlled substances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not affect an employer's right or ability to make employment-related decisions regarding a license holder. This section does not restrict the authority of the disciplining authority to take disciplinary action for any other unprofessional conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who, in good faith, reports information or takes action in connection with this section is immune from civil liability for reporting information or taking the action.</p>

<p>The commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption relating to the practice of the person's profession, whether the act constitutes a crime or not. If the act constitutes a crime, conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to disciplinary action. Upon such a conviction, however, the judgment and sentence is conclusive evidence at the ensuing disciplinary hearing of the guilt of the license holder of the crime described in the indictment or information, and of the person's violation of the statute on which it is based.

Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion for personal gain of any unnecessary or inefficacious drug, device, treatment, procedure, or service;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conviction of any gross misdemeanor or felony relating to the practice of the person's profession.

<li>
<p>The secretary shall investigate complaints concerning practice by unlicensed persons of a profession or business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040. In the investigation of the complaints, the secretary shall have the same authority as provided the secretary under RCW 18.130.050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary may issue a notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order to any person whom the secretary has reason to believe is engaged in the unlicensed practice of a profession or business for which a license is required by the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040. The person to whom such notice is issued may request an adjudicative proceeding to contest the charges. The request for hearing must be filed within twenty days after service of the notice of intention to issue a cease and desist order. The failure to request a hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the secretary may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine. All proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the secretary makes a final determination that a person has engaged or is engaging in unlicensed practice, the secretary may issue a cease and desist order. In addition, the secretary may impose a civil fine in an amount not exceeding one thousand dollars for each day upon which the person engaged in unlicensed practice of a business or profession for which a license is required by one or more of the chapters specified in RCW 18.130.040. The proceeds of such fines shall be deposited to the health professions account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the secretary makes a written finding of fact that the public interest will be irreparably harmed by delay in issuing an order, the secretary may issue a temporary cease and desist order. The person receiving a temporary cease and desist order shall be provided an opportunity for a prompt hearing. The temporary cease and desist order shall remain in effect until further order of the secretary. The failure to request a prompt or regularly scheduled hearing constitutes a default, whereupon the secretary may enter a permanent cease and desist order, which may include a civil fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the issuance of a cease and desist order nor payment of a civil fine shall relieve the person so practicing or operating a business without a license from criminal prosecution therefor, but the remedy of a cease and desist order or civil fine shall be in addition to any criminal liability. The cease and desist order is conclusive proof of unlicensed practice and may be enforced under RCW 7.21.060. This method of enforcement of the cease and desist order or civil fine may be used in addition to, or as an alternative to, any provisions for enforcement of agency orders set out in chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
