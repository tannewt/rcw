<p>The legislature finds that the health and well-being of the people of this state are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the conduct of members of the dental profession licensed to practice dentistry in this state plays a vital role in preserving the health and well-being of the people of the state.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that requiring continuing dental education for all licensed dentists in the state is an important component of providing high quality dentistry for the people of this state.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that there is no effective means of handling disciplinary proceedings against members of the dental profession licensed in this state when such proceedings are necessary for the protection of the public health.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature declares its intention to exercise the police power of the state to protect the public health, to promote the welfare of the state, and to provide a commission to act as a disciplinary and regulatory body for the members of the dental profession licensed to practice dentistry in this state.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of the commission established in RCW 18.32.0351 to regulate the competency and quality of professional health care providers under its jurisdiction by establishing, monitoring, and enforcing qualifications for licensure, continuing education, consistent standards of practice, continuing competency mechanisms, and discipline. Rules, policies, and procedures developed by the commission must promote the delivery of quality health care to the residents of the state.</p>

Prior to July 1, 2010, a dental residency program must be accredited by the commission on dental accreditation, or be in the process of obtaining such accreditation, in order to be approved by the commission.

<p>The commission may condition the granting of a license under this section with terms the commission deems appropriate. All persons licensed under this section shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the commission to the same extent as other members of the dental profession, in accordance with this chapter, and in addition the licensee may be disciplined by the commission after a hearing has been held in accordance with the provisions set forth in this chapter, and determination by the commission that such licensee has violated any of the restrictions set forth in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons applying for licensure pursuant to this section shall pay the application fee determined by the secretary and, in the event the license applied for is issued, a license fee at the rate provided for licenses generally.

<ol>
<li>
<p>In any disciplinary case pertaining to a dentist where there is a contested hearing, if the commission or its hearing panel makes the finding requisite for, and imposes upon the dentist, a disciplinary sanction or fine under RCW 18.130.160, unless it determines to waive the assessment of a hearing fee, it shall assess against the licensee a partial recovery of the state's hearing expenses as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The partial recovery hearing fee must be:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An amount equal to six thousand dollars for each full hearing day in the proceeding and one-half of that amount for any partial hearing day; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A partial recovery of investigative and hearing preparation expenses in an amount as found to be reasonable reimbursement under the circumstances but no more than ten thousand dollars;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantiation of investigative and hearing preparation expenses for purposes of (a) of this subsection may be by affidavit or declaration descriptive of efforts expended, which are reviewable in the hearing as would be a cost bill;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission or its hearing panel may waive the partial recovery hearing fee if it determines the assessment of the fee (i) would create substantial undue hardship for the dentist, or (ii) in all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the charges alleged, it would be manifestly unjust to assess the fee. Consideration of the waiver must be applied for and considered during the hearing itself. This may be in advance of the decision related to RCW 18.130.160.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the dentist seeks judicial review of the disciplinary action and there was a partial recovery hearing fee assessed, then unless the license holder achieves a substantial element of relief, the reviewing trial court or appellate court shall further impose a partial cost recovery fee in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars at the superior court level, twenty-five thousand dollars at the court of appeals level, and twenty-five thousand dollars at the supreme court level. Application for waiver may be made to the court at each level and must be considered by the court under the standards stated in subsection (1)(c) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any disciplinary case pertaining to a dentist where the case is resolved by agreement prior to completion of a contested hearing, the commission shall assess against the dentist a partial recovery of investigative and hearing preparation expenses in an amount as found to be reasonable reimbursement in the circumstances but no more than ten thousand dollars, unless it determines to waive this fee under the standards stated in subsection (1)(c) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any stipulated informal disposition of allegations pertaining to a dentist as contemplated under RCW 18.130.172, the potential dollar limit of reimbursement of investigative and processing costs may not exceed two thousand dollars per allegation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the dentist fail to pay any agreed reimbursement or ordered cost recovery under the statute, the commission may seek collection of the amount in the same manner as enforcement of a fine under RCW 18.130.165.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All fee recoveries and reimbursements under this statute must be deposited to the health professions account for the portion of it allocated to the commission. The fee recoveries shall be fully credited in reduction of actual or projected expenditures used to determine dentist license renewal fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority of the commission under this section is in addition to all of its authorities under RCW 18.130.160, elsewhere in chapter 18.130 RCW, or in this chapter.</p>
