## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [47.46.190](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.46_public-private_transportation_initiatives.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.46_public-private_transportation_initiatives.md) for context.

1. The legislature finds funding of the Tacoma Narrows bridge facility to be distinct from other Washington state tolling facilities due to its increasing debt service costs, which is the primary driver of the facility's escalating costs. Washington state has since recommended and established financing structures with steadier levels of debt service payments for subsequent tolled transportation facilities, supporting better management of the state's debt burden and a lower financial burden for toll ratepayers.

2. The Tacoma Narrows bridge facility debt service structure resulted, in part, from a decision by the legislature to fund construction of the bridge without drawing from state tax dollars. As a result, toll revenue was committed to fund **99** percent of bridge construction costs, as well as the associated interest payments and other associated debt service costs. This is not the standard more recently utilized by the legislature, as is the case of the state route 520 bridge's construction**project and the construction of the portion of state route number 99 that is a deep bore tunnel, wherein 72** percent **and six percent** of which **, respectively, are** to be paid for with toll revenues. In light of the maximum burden for bridge construction that was placed on Tacoma Narrows bridge toll ratepayers, there is no equitable reason that the burden of future debt service payment increases should be borne by these same toll ratepayers.

3. The legislature established the Tacoma Narrows bridge work group in 2017 and tasked it with identifying opportunities for long-term toll payer relief from increasing toll rates on the Tacoma Narrows bridge. **In 2018, the legislature enacted the first phase of corrective funding measures and, with an eye on future revenue, established a financial structure base from which to enact future equitable solutions. The legislature now finds that current revenues are in place to enact phase two of the corrective funding measures and intends to convert the 2018 monetary allocations into permanent state grants to bring further stability to the Tacoma Narrows bridge toll rate setting and to offset the tolling revenue impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.**

4. **It is the intent of the legislature that state appropriations or transfers** for each fiscal biennium**, without an expectation of repayment from tollpayers,** are to be made **from other accounts to the Tacoma Narrows toll bridge account created in RCW 47.56.165** through the life of the debt service plan of up to a total of **$85,000,000**. It is the intent of the legislature that the commission will:

    a. Maintain tolls at no more than toll rates effective at the fiscal year 2018 level until fiscal year 2022; and

    b. Maintain tolls at no more than **25** cents higher than the toll rates effective at the fiscal year 2018 level beginning in fiscal year 2022 until such time as the debt service and deferred sales tax obligation is fully met according to the repayment schedule in place as of June 7, 2018.

5. To offset part of the toll rate increases that would otherwise be necessary to meet increases in future debt service payments, it is the intent of the legislature that **sufficient amounts of funds be appropriated or transferred from other accounts** to the Tacoma Narrows toll bridge account created in RCW 47.56.165 on the first day of each fiscal biennium, beginning in the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium, through the life of the debt service plan. It is the intent of the legislature that the  amounts **are adequately sufficient** to ensure debt service payments are made in full after toll revenue from the Tacoma Narrows bridge toll facility is applied to the debt payment amounts and other required costs.

6. This section does not create a private right of action.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [47.46.200](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.46_public-private_transportation_initiatives.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.46_public-private_transportation_initiatives.md) for context.

1. Through 2031, the commission shall submit to the transportation committees of the legislature on an annual basis a report that includes sufficient information to enable the legislature to determine an adequate amount of contribution from nontoll sources required for each fiscal biennium to maintain tolls **for the Tacoma Narrows toll bridge** at no more than **25** cents higher than the toll rates effective at the fiscal year 2018 level, while also maintaining the **Tacoma Narrows toll bridge** debt service plan repayment schedule in place as of June 7, 2018. The report must be submitted by January 5th of each year.

2.

This section does not create a private right of action.
