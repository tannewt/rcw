<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the development, establishment, and enforcement of standards for the maintenance and operation of nursing homes, which, in the light of advancing knowledge, will promote safe and adequate care and treatment of the individuals therein. An important secondary purpose is the improvement of nursing home practices by educational methods so that such practices eventually exceed the minimum requirements of the basic law and its original standards.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the closure of a nursing home can have devastating effects on residents and, under certain circumstances, courts should consider placing nursing homes in receivership. As receivership has long existed as a remedy to preserve assets subject to litigation and to reorganize troubled affairs, the legislature finds that receivership is to be used to correct problems associated with either the disregard of residents' health, safety, or welfare or with the possible closure of the nursing home for any reason.</p>

<p>The facility has not given the department prior written notice of its intent to close and has not made arrangements within thirty days before closure for the orderly transfer of its residents: PROVIDED, That if the facility has given the department prior written notice but the department has not acted with all deliberate speed to transfer the facility's residents, this shall bar the filing of a petition under this subsection;</p>

<li>
<p>The facility demonstrates a pattern or practice of violating a condition level as defined by the federal government under the authority of Title XIX of the social security act.</p>

The current or former operator or licensee and the owner of the nursing home, if different than the operator or licensee, shall be made a party to the action. The court shall grant the petition if it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that one or more of the conditions listed in subsections (1) through (5) of this section exists and, subject to RCW 18.51.420, that the current operator is unable or unwilling to take actions necessary to immediately correct the conditions.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the spiraling costs of nursing home care continue to surmount efforts to contain them, increasing at approximately twice the inflationary rate. The causes of this phenomenon are complex. By making nursing home facilities and care providers more aware of the cost consequences of care services for consumers, these providers may be inclined to exercise more restraint in providing only the most relevant and cost-beneficial services and care, with a potential for reducing the utilization of those services. The requirement of the nursing home to inform physicians, consumers, and other care providers of the charges of the services that they order may have a positive effect on containing health costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All nursing home administrators in facilities licensed under this chapter shall be required to develop and maintain a written procedure for disclosing patient charges to attending physicians with admitting privileges. The nursing home administrator shall have the capability to provide an itemized list of the charges for all health care services that may be ordered by a physician. The information shall be made available on request of consumers, or the physicians or other appropriate health care providers responsible for prescribing care.</p>
