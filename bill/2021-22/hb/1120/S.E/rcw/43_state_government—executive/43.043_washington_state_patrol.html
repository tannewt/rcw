<p>The chief of the Washington state patrol shall relieve from active duty Washington state patrol officers who, while in the performance of their official duties, or while on standby or available for duty, have been or hereafter may be injured or incapacitated to such an extent as to be mentally or physically incapable of active service: PROVIDED, That:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Any officer disabled while performing line duty who is found by the chief to be physically incapacitated shall be placed on disability leave for a period not to exceed six months from the date of injury or the date incapacitated. During this period, the officer shall be entitled to all pay, benefits, insurance, leave, and retirement contributions awarded to an officer on active status, less any compensation received through the department of labor and industries. No such disability leave shall be approved until an officer has been unavailable for duty for more than forty consecutive work hours. Prior to the end of the six-month period, the chief shall either place the officer on disability status or return the officer to active status.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;line duty&quot; is active service which encompasses the traffic law enforcement duties and/or other law enforcement responsibilities of the state patrol. These activities encompass all enforcement practices of the laws, accident and criminal investigations, or actions requiring physical exertion or exposure to hazardous elements.</p>
<p>The chief shall define by rule the situations where a disability has occurred during line duty;</p>

<li>
<p>Benefits under this section for a disability that is incurred while in other employment will be reduced by any amount the officer receives or is entitled to receive from workers' compensation, social security, group insurance, other pension plan, or any other similar source provided by another employer on account of the same disability;</p>

<li>
<p>An officer injured while engaged in willfully tortious or criminal conduct shall not be entitled to disability benefits under this section; and</p>

<li>
<p>Should a disability beneficiary whose disability was not incurred in line of duty, prior to attaining age fifty, engage in a gainful occupation, the chief shall reduce the amount of his or her retirement allowance to an amount which when added to the compensation earned by him or her in such occupation shall not exceed the basic salary currently being paid for the rank the retired officer held at the time he or she was disabled. All such disability beneficiaries under age fifty shall file with the chief every six months a signed and sworn statement of earnings and any person who shall knowingly swear falsely on such statement shall be subject to prosecution for perjury. Should the earning capacity of such beneficiary be further altered, the chief may further alter his or her disability retirement allowance as indicated above. The failure of any officer to file the required statement of earnings shall be cause for cancellation of retirement benefits.</p>

<p>Officers on disability status shall receive one-half of their compensation at the existing wage, during the time the disability continues in effect, less any compensation received through the department of labor and industries. They shall be subject to mental or physical examination at any state institution or otherwise under the direction of the chief of the patrol at any time during such relief from duty to ascertain whether or not they are able to resume active duty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the compensation provided in (a) of this subsection, the compensation of an officer who is totally disabled during line duty shall include reimbursement for any payments of premiums made after June 10, 2010, for employer-provided medical insurance. An officer is considered totally disabled if he or she is unable to perform any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental condition that may be expected to result in death or that has lasted or is expected to last at least twelve months. Substantial gainful activity is defined as average earnings in excess of eight hundred sixty dollars a month in 2006 adjusted annually as determined by the department of retirement systems based on federal social security disability standards. An officer in receipt of reimbursement for any payments of premium rates for employer-provided medical insurance under this subsection is required to file with the chief any financial records that are necessary to determine continued eligibility for such reimbursement. The failure of any officer to file the required financial records is cause for cancellation of the reimbursement. The legislature reserves the right to amend or repeal the benefits provided in this subsection (2)(b) in the future and no member or beneficiary has a contractual right to receive any distribution not granted prior to that time.</p>

<p>The minimum monthly salary paid to state patrol troopers and sergeants must be competitive with law enforcement agencies within the boundaries of the state of Washington, guided by the results of a survey undertaken in the collective bargaining process during each biennium. The salary levels must be guided by the average of compensation paid to the corresponding rank from the Seattle police department, King county sheriff's office, Tacoma police department, Snohomish county sheriff's office, Spokane police department, and Vancouver police department. Compensation must be calculated using base salary, premium pay (a pay received by more than a majority of employees), education pay, and longevity pay. The compensation comparison data is based on the Washington state patrol and the law enforcement agencies listed in this section. Increases in salary levels for captains and lieutenants that are collectively bargained must be proportionate to the increases in salaries for troopers and sergeants as a result of the survey described in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2024, as part of the salary survey required in this section, the office of financial management must report to the governor and transportation committees of the legislature on the efficacy of Washington state patrol recruitment and retention efforts. Using the results of the 2016 salary survey as the baseline data, the report must include an analysis of voluntary resignations of state patrol troopers and sergeants and a comparison of state patrol academy class sizes and trooper graduations.</p>

<p>Bicycling is increasing in popularity as a form of recreation and as an alternative mode of transportation. To make bicycling safer, the various law enforcement agencies should enforce traffic regulations for bicyclists. By enforcing bicycle regulations, law enforcement officers are reinforcing educational programs. Bicycling takes more skill than most people realize. Since bicyclists have a low profile in traffic and are unprotected, they need more defensive riding skills than motorists do.</p>
<p>A bicycle awareness program is created within the Washington state patrol. In developing the curriculum for the bicycle awareness program the patrol shall consult with the traffic safety commission and with bicycling groups providing bicycle safety education. The patrol shall conduct the program in conjunction with the safety education officer program and may use other law enforcement personnel and volunteers to implement the program for children in grades kindergarten through six. The patrol shall ensure that each safety educator presenting the bicycle awareness program has received specialized training in bicycle safety education and has been trained in effective defensive bicycle riding skills.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that recent developments in molecular biology and genetics have important applications for forensic science. It has been scientifically established that there is a unique pattern to the chemical structure of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contained in each cell of the human body. The process for identifying this pattern is called &quot;DNA identification.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that DNA databases are important tools in criminal investigations, in the exclusion of individuals who are the subject of investigations or prosecutions, and in detecting recidivist acts. It is the policy of this state to assist federal, state, and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in both the identification and detection of individuals in criminal investigations and the identification and location of missing and unidentified persons. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the state to establish a DNA database and DNA data bank containing DNA samples submitted by persons convicted of felony offenses and other crimes as specified in RCW 43.43.754. DNA samples necessary for the identification of missing persons and unidentified human remains shall also be included in the DNA database.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the DNA identification system used by the federal bureau of investigation and the Washington state patrol has no ability to predict genetic disease or predisposal to illness. Nonetheless, the legislature intends that biological samples collected under RCW 43.43.754, and DNA identification data obtained from the samples, be used only for purposes related to criminal investigation, identification of human remains or missing persons, or improving the operation of the system authorized under RCW 43.43.752 through 43.43.758.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that fire protection services at the state level are provided by different, independent state agencies. This has resulted in a lack of a comprehensive state-level focus for state fire protection services, funding, and policy. The legislature further finds that the paramount duty of the state in fire protection services is to enhance the capacity of all local jurisdictions to assure that their personnel with fire suppression, prevention, inspection, origin and cause, and arson investigation responsibilities are adequately trained to discharge their responsibilities. It is the intent of the legislature to consolidate fire protection services into a single state agency. It is also the intent of the legislature that the fire protection services program created herein will assist local fire protection agencies in program development without encroaching upon their historic autonomy. It is the further intent of the legislature that the fire protection services program be implemented incrementally to assure a smooth transition, to build local, regional, and state capacity, and to avoid undue burdens on jurisdictions with limited resources.</p>

During a large scale emergency, mobilization includes the redistribution of regional or statewide risk resources to either direct emergency incident assignments or to assignment in communities where resources are needed. All risk resources may not be mobilized to assist law enforcement with police activities during a civil protest or demonstration, or other exercise by the people of their constitutionally protected First Amendment rights, or other protected concerted activity, however, fire departments, fire districts, and regional fire protection service authorities are not restricted from providing medical care or aid and firefighting when mobilized for any purpose.</p>

<p>When mobilization is declared and authorized as provided in this chapter, all risk resources regularly provided by fire departments, fire districts, and regional fire protection service authorities including those of the host fire protection authorities, i.e. incident jurisdiction, shall be deemed as mobilized under this chapter, including those that responded earlier under existing mutual aid or other agreement. All nonhost fire protection authorities providing resources in response to a mobilization declaration shall be eligible for expense reimbursement as provided by this chapter from the time of the mobilization declaration.</p>
<p>This chapter shall not reduce or suspend the authority or responsibility of the department of natural resources under chapter 76.04 RCW.</p>

<p>Because of the possibility of the occurrence of disastrous fires or other disasters of unprecedented size and destructiveness, the need to insure that the state is adequately prepared to respond to such a fire or disaster, the need to establish a mechanism and a procedure to provide for reimbursement to state agencies and local agencies that respond to help others in time of need or to a host fire district that experiences expenses beyond the resources of the fire district, and generally to protect the public peace, health, safety, lives, and property of the people of Washington, it is hereby declared necessary to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Provide the policy and organizational structure for large scale mobilization of all risk resources in the state through creation of the Washington state fire services mobilization plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confer upon the chief the powers provided herein;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a means for reimbursement to state agencies and local fire jurisdictions that incur expenses when mobilized by the chief under the Washington state fire services mobilization plan; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for reimbursement of the host fire department or fire protection district when it has: (a) Exhausted all of its resources; and (b) invoked its local mutual aid network and exhausted those resources. Upon implementation of state fire mobilization, the host district resources shall become state fire mobilization resources consistent with the fire mobilization plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that mutual aid and other interlocal agreements providing for enhanced emergency response be encouraged as essential to the public peace, safety, health, and welfare, and for the protection of the lives and property of the people of the state of Washington. If possible, mutual aid agreements should be without stated limitations as to resources available, time, or area. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed or interpreted to limit the eligibility of any nonhost fire protection authority for reimbursement of expenses incurred in providing all risk resources for mobilization provided that the mobilization must meet the requirements identified in the Washington state fire service mobilization plan.</p>
