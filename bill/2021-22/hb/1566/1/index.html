<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that people with disabilities are often left out of the policy decisions that affect them most. Disabled people have lived experience navigating societal barriers and are therefore best equipped to find solutions through these barriers. According to the department of social and health services, approximately 13 percent of state residents live with a disability. People with disabilities face greater hardships finding and maintaining employment that pays a living wage, attaining higher education, and finding places to live. The poverty rate for disabled people in Washington is 20 percent, which is nearly twice the rate for people without disabilities. In addition, people with disabilities are employed at less than half the rate of people without disabilities. Because disabled people make less money, and their income is often supplemented by the government, they may have trouble finding places to live. Additionally, affordable housing is not always accessible housing. People with disabilities know these struggles firsthand, so it is essential that they have the opportunity to participate in and guide decision-making processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds people with disabilities are almost entirely unrepresented in policy making. A governing body that makes decisions about disability, cannot do so effectively without the voices of that group present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to ensure meaningful participation from disabled people on each task force, select committee, work group, advisory committee, or other statutory entity that makes decisions affecting disabled people. When people with disabilities have a seat at the table, Washington thrives.</p>
