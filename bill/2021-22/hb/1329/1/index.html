<p>It is the intent of this act to urge governing bodies, and particularly governing bodies formed under chapter 36.57A or 81.112 RCW, to move to online meetings to allow for more public participation opportunities and more diverse public comment. During the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States and Washington state, there was a gubernatorial proclamation authorizing governing bodies to utilize remote meetings. It was found that meetings conducted via remote access were successful in reigniting the spirit of RCW 42.30.030 thanks to the courage, ingenuity, and integrity of many public servants.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that, unless impracticable, all meetings must have remote access, and may if necessary have an in-person component, both for increased accessibility for all Washingtonians and especially disabled persons; but also to limit greenhouse gas emissions as per RCW 70A.45.005 and 70A.05.900. The legislature further finds that Washington should continue to be a national and international leader on energy conservation and environmental stewardship by recognizing travel to and from public meetings represents a significant source of emissions, and that reducing the need for such travel is achievable, cost-effective, and innovative in emission reduction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.html">42.30.010</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that all public commissions, boards, councils, committees, subcommittees, departments, divisions, offices, and all other public agencies of this state and subdivisions thereof exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of this chapter that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.</p>
<p>The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed <strong>and informing the people's public servants of their views before significant final actions are taken</strong> so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created. <strong>For these reasons, even when not required by law, public agencies are encouraged to incorporate and accept public comment at all stages of their decision-making process.</strong></p>
