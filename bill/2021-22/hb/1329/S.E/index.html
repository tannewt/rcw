<h2 id="section-1-3185">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3185">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds people participating in their government, especially through public comment, is an essential part of developing public policy. The legislature further finds that there are numerous developing technologies that can be used to facilitate public comment, especially for those with disabilities, underserved communities, and those who face time or distance challenges when traveling to public meetings. Therefore, the legislature intends to encourage public agencies to make use of remote access tools as fully as practicable to encourage public engagement and better serve their communities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.html">42.30.010</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.30_open_public_meetings_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that all public commissions, boards, councils, committees, subcommittees, departments, divisions, offices, and all other public agencies of this state and subdivisions thereof exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of this chapter that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.</p>
<p>The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed <strong>and informing the people's public servants of their views</strong> so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created. <strong>For these reasons, even when not required by law, public agencies are encouraged to incorporate and accept public comment during their decision-making process.</strong></p>
