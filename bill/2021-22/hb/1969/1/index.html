<ol>
<li>
<p>The use of automated traffic safety cameras for issuance of notices of infraction is subject to the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except for proposed locations used solely for the pilot program purposes permitted under subsection (6) of this section, the appropriate local legislative authority must prepare an analysis of the locations within the jurisdiction where automated traffic safety cameras are proposed to be located: (i) Before enacting an ordinance allowing for the initial use of automated traffic safety cameras; and (ii) before adding additional cameras or relocating any existing camera to a new location within the jurisdiction. Automated traffic safety cameras may be used to detect one or more of the following: Stoplight, railroad crossing, or school speed zone violations; speed violations subject to (c) <strong>or (d)</strong> of this subsection; or violations included in subsection (6) of this section for the duration of the pilot program authorized under subsection (6) of this section. At a minimum, the local ordinance must contain the restrictions described in this section and provisions for public notice and signage. Cities and counties using automated traffic safety cameras before July 24, 2005, are subject to the restrictions described in this section, but are not required to enact an authorizing ordinance. Beginning one year after June 7, 2012, cities and counties using automated traffic safety cameras must post an annual report of the number of traffic accidents that occurred at each location where an automated traffic safety camera is located as well as the number of notices of infraction issued for each camera and any other relevant information about the automated traffic safety cameras that the city or county deems appropriate on the city's or county's website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (c) <strong>and (d)</strong> of this subsection and subsection (6) of this section, use of automated traffic safety cameras is restricted to the following locations only: (i) Intersections of two or more arterials with traffic control signals that have yellow change interval durations in accordance with RCW 47.36.022, which interval durations may not be reduced after placement of the camera; (ii) railroad crossings; and (iii) school speed zones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any city west of the Cascade mountains with a population of more than <strong>195,000</strong> located in a county with a population of fewer than <strong>1,500,000</strong> may operate an automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations subject to the following limitations:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A city may only operate one such automated traffic safety camera within its respective jurisdiction; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use and location of the automated traffic safety camera must have first been authorized by the Washington state legislature as a pilot project for at least one full year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><strong>Cities may operate at least one automated traffic safety camera under this subsection to detect speed violations, subject to the requirements of (d)(ii) of this subsection. Cities may operate one additional automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations for every 10,000 residents included in the city's population. Cameras must be placed in locations that comply with one of the following:</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) <strong>The location has been identified as a priority location in a local road safety plan that a city has submitted to the Washington state department of transportation and where other speed reduction measures are not feasible or have not been sufficiently effective at reducing travel speed;</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>The location has a significantly higher rate of collisions than the city average in a period of at least three years prior to installation and other speed reduction measures are not feasible or have not been sufficiently effective at reducing travel speed;</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>The location is in an area within the city limits designated by local ordinance as a zone subject to specified restrictions and penalties on racing and race attendance; or</strong></p>
<p>(D) <strong>The location is within 300 feet of the border of a park or community center property.</strong></p>
<pre><code>    ii.(A) **A city locating an automated traffic safety camera under this subsection (1)(d) must complete an equity analysis that evaluates livability, accessibility, economics, education, and environmental health, and shall consider the outcome of that analysis when identifying where to locate an automated traffic safety camera.**
</code></pre>
<p>(B) <strong>Automated traffic safety cameras must be placed in a manner that limits drivers from diverting to alternative roads to avoid an automated traffic safety camera.</strong></p>
<pre><code>e. Automated traffic safety cameras may only take pictures of the vehicle and vehicle license plate and only while an infraction is occurring. The picture must not reveal the face of the driver or of passengers in the vehicle. The primary purpose of camera placement is to take pictures of the vehicle and vehicle license plate when an infraction is occurring. Cities and counties shall consider installing cameras in a manner that minimizes the impact of camera flash on drivers.

f. A notice of infraction must be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within **14** days of the violation, or to the renter of a vehicle within **14** days of establishing the renter's name and address under subsection (3)(a) of this section. The law enforcement officer issuing the notice of infraction shall include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a violation under this chapter. The photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images evidencing the violation must be available for inspection and admission into evidence in a proceeding to adjudicate the liability for the infraction. A person receiving a notice of infraction based on evidence detected by an automated traffic safety camera may respond to the notice by mail.

g. The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible for an infraction under RCW 46.63.030(1)(d) unless the registered owner overcomes the presumption in RCW 46.63.075, or, in the case of a rental car business, satisfies the conditions under subsection (3) of this section. If appropriate under the circumstances, a renter identified under subsection (3)(a) of this section is responsible for an infraction.

h. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images, or any other personally identifying data prepared under this section are for the exclusive use of law enforcement in the discharge of duties under this section and are not open to the public and may not be used in a court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a violation under this section. No photograph, microphotograph, or electronic image, or any other personally identifying data may be used for any purpose other than enforcement of violations under this section nor retained longer than necessary to enforce this section.

i. All locations where an automated traffic safety camera is used must be clearly marked at least **30** days prior to activation of the camera by placing signs in locations that clearly indicate to a driver that he or she is entering a zone where traffic laws are enforced by an automated traffic safety camera. Signs placed in automated traffic safety camera locations after June 7, 2012, must follow the specifications and guidelines under the manual of uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways as adopted by the department of transportation under chapter 47.36 RCW.

j. If a county or city has established an authorized automated traffic safety camera program under this section, the compensation paid to the manufacturer or vendor of the equipment used must be based only upon the value of the equipment and services provided or rendered in support of the system, and may not be based upon a portion of the fine or civil penalty imposed or the revenue generated by the equipment.

k. **If a city is operating an automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations under (c) or (d) of this subsection, the city shall remit monthly to the state 50 percent of the noninterest money received for infractions issued by those cameras excess of the cost to administer, install, operate, and maintain the automated traffic safety cameras, including the cost of processing infractions. Money remitted under this subsection to the state treasurer shall be deposited in the Cooper Jones active transportation safety account created in RCW 46.68.480. The remaining 50 percent retained by the city must be used only for improvements to transportation that support equitable access and mobility for persons with disabilities.**

<li>
<p>Infractions detected through the use of automated traffic safety cameras are not part of the registered owner's driving record under RCW 46.52.101 and 46.52.120. Additionally, infractions generated by the use of automated traffic safety cameras under this section shall be processed in the same manner as parking infractions, including for the purposes of RCW 3.50.100, 35.20.220, 46.16A.120, and 46.20.270(2). Except as provided otherwise in subsection (6) of this section, the amount of the fine issued for an infraction generated through the use of an automated traffic safety camera shall not exceed the amount of a fine issued for other parking infractions within the jurisdiction. However, the amount of the fine issued for a traffic control signal violation detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera shall not exceed the monetary penalty for a violation of RCW 46.61.050 as provided under RCW 46.63.110, including all applicable statutory assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental car business, the law enforcement agency shall, before a notice of infraction being issued under this section, provide a written notice to the rental car business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business if the rental car business does not, within <strong>18</strong> days of receiving the written notice, provide to the issuing agency by return mail:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A statement under oath stating the name and known mailing address of the individual driving or renting the vehicle when the infraction occurred; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement under oath that the business is unable to determine who was driving or renting the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred because the vehicle was stolen at the time of the infraction. A statement provided under this subsection must be accompanied by a copy of a filed police report regarding the vehicle theft; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lieu of identifying the vehicle operator, the rental car business may pay the applicable penalty.</p>
