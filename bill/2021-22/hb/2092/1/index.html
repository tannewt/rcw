<li>
<p>Have authority to delegate to agencies authorization to purchase goods and services.

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop guidelines and criteria for the purchase of vehicles, high gas mileage vehicles, and alternate vehicle fuels and systems, equipment, and materials, that reduce overall energy-related costs and energy use by the state, including investigations into all opportunities to aggregate the purchasing of clean technologies by state and local governments, and including the requirement that new passenger vehicles purchased by the state meet the minimum standards for passenger automobile fuel economy established by the United States secretary of transportation pursuant to the energy policy and conservation act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 2002); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and enact rules to implement the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p>After bids that are submitted in response to a competitive solicitation process are reviewed by the awarding agency, the awarding agency may:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Reject all bids and rebid or cancel the competitive solicitation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request best and final offers from responsive and responsible bidders; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Award the purchase or contract to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agency may award one or more contracts from a competitive solicitation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether the bidder is a responsible bidder, the agency must consider the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the bidder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bidder can perform the contract within the time specified;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws relating to the contract or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether, within the three-year period immediately preceding the date of the bid solicitation, the bidder has been determined by a final and binding citation and notice of assessment issued by the department of labor and industries or through a civil judgment entered by a court of limited or general jurisdiction to have willfully violated, as defined in RCW 49.48.082, any provision of chapter 49.46, 49.48, or 49.52 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whether the bidder can guarantee reasonable product lead time during periods when economic conditions have caused disruptions to relevant supply chains; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, an agency may consider best value criteria, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the bid satisfies the needs of the state as specified in the solicitation documents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid encourages diverse contractor participation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid provides competitive pricing, economies, and efficiencies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid considers human health and environmental impacts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid appropriately weighs cost and noncost considerations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life-cycle cost.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solicitation document must clearly set forth the requirements and criteria that the agency will apply in evaluating bid submissions. Before award of a contract, a bidder shall submit to the contracting agency a signed statement in accordance with chapter 5.50 RCW verifying under penalty of perjury that the bidder is in compliance with the responsible bidder criteria requirement of subsection (2)(f) of this section. A contracting agency may award a contract in reasonable reliance upon such a sworn statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The awarding agency may at its discretion reject the bid of any contractor who has failed to perform satisfactorily on a previous contract with the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reviewing all bid submissions, an agency may enter into negotiations with the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in order to determine if the bid may be improved. An agency may not use this negotiation opportunity to permit a bidder to change a nonresponsive bid into a responsive bid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procuring agency must enter into the state's enterprise vendor registration and bid notification system the name of each bidder and an indication as to the successful bidder.</p>

<ol>
<li>Any second‑class city or any town may construct any public works, as defined in RCW 39.04.010, by contract or day labor without calling for bids therefor whenever the estimated cost of the work or improvement, including cost of materials, supplies and equipment will not exceed the sum of one hundred sixteen thousand one hundred fifty-five dollars if more than one craft or trade is involved with the public works, or seventy-five thousand five hundred dollars if a single craft or trade is involved with the public works or the public works project is street signalization or street lighting. A public works project means a complete project. The restrictions in this subsection do not permit the division of the project into units of work or classes of work to avoid the restriction on work that may be performed by day labor on a single project.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever the cost of the public work or improvement, including materials, supplies and equipment, will exceed these figures, the same shall be done by contract. All such contracts shall be let at public bidding upon publication of notice calling for sealed bids upon the work. The notice shall be published in the official newspaper, or a newspaper of general circulation most likely to bring responsive bids, at least thirteen days prior to the last date upon which bids will be received. The notice shall generally state the nature of the work to be done that plans and specifications therefor shall then be on file in the city or town hall for public inspections, and require that bids be sealed and filed with the council or commission within the time specified therein. Each bid shall be accompanied by a bid proposal deposit in the form of a cashier's check, postal money order, or surety bond to the council or commission for a sum of not less than five percent of the amount of the bid, and no bid shall be considered unless accompanied by such bid proposal deposit. The council or commission of the city or town shall let the contract to the lowest responsible bidder or shall have power by resolution to reject any or all bids and to make further calls for bids in the same manner as the original call.</p>
<p>When the contract is let then all bid proposal deposits shall be returned to the bidders except that of the successful bidder which shall be retained until a contract is entered into and a bond to perform the work furnished, with surety satisfactory to the council or commission, in accordance with RCW 39.08.030. If the bidder fails to enter into the contract in accordance with his or her bid and furnish a bond within ten days from the date at which he or she is notified that he or she is the successful bidder, the check or postal money order and the amount thereof shall be forfeited to the council or commission or the council or commission shall recover the amount of the surety bond. A low bidder who claims error and fails to enter into a contract is prohibited from bidding on the same project if a second or subsequent call for bids is made for the project.</p>
<p>If no bid is received on the first call the council or commission may readvertise and make a second call, or may enter into a contract without any further call or may purchase the supplies, material or equipment and perform the work or improvement by day labor.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;lowest responsible bidder&quot; means a bid that meets the criteria under RCW 39.04.350 and has the lowest bid; provided, that if the city issues a written finding that the lowest bidder has delivered a project to the city within the last three years which was late, over budget, or did not meet specifications, and the city does not find in writing that such bidder has shown how they would improve performance to be likely to meet project specifications then the city may choose the second lowest bidder whose bid is within five percent of the lowest bid and meets the same criteria as the lowest bidder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The allocation of public works projects to be performed by city or town employees shall not be subject to a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lieu of the procedures of subsection (1) of this section, a second‑class city or a town may let contracts using the small works roster process provided in RCW 39.04.155.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever possible, the city or town shall invite at least one proposal from a certified minority or woman contractor who shall otherwise qualify under this section.</p>

<p>The form required by RCW 43.09.205 shall be to account and record costs of public works in excess of five thousand dollars that are not let by contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost of a separate public works project shall be the costs of the materials, equipment, supplies, and labor on that construction project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any purchase of supplies, material, or equipment, except for public work or improvement, where the cost thereof exceeds seven thousand five hundred dollars shall be made upon call for bids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bids shall be called annually and at a time and in the manner prescribed by ordinance for the publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or town of all notices or newspaper publications required by law. The contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder**, except that during periods when economic conditions have caused disruptions to relevant supply chains, product lead time must be considered in addition to price**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For advertisement and formal sealed bidding to be dispensed with as to purchases with an estimated value of fifteen thousand dollars or less, the council or commission must authorize by resolution, use of the uniform procedure provided in RCW 39.04.190.</p>
