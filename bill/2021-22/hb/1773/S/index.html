<p>Either an agency or facility designated to monitor or provide services under a less restrictive alternative order or conditional release, or a designated crisis responder, may take action to enforce, modify, or revoke a less restrictive alternative <strong>treatment order</strong> or conditional release <strong>order</strong>. The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder must determine that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The person is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of the  order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred;</p>

<li>
<p>Actions taken under this section must include a flexible range of responses of varying levels of intensity appropriate to the circumstances and consistent with the interests of the individual and the public in personal autonomy, safety, recovery, and compliance. Available actions may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To counsel or advise the person as to their rights and responsibilities under the court order, and to offer  incentives to motivate compliance;</p>

<li>
<p>To increase the intensity of outpatient services provided to the person by increasing the frequency of contacts with the provider, referring the person for an assessment for assertive community services, or by other means;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To request a court hearing for review and modification of the court order. The request must be <strong>directed to</strong> the court with jurisdiction over the order and specify the circumstances that give rise to the request and what modification is being sought. The county prosecutor shall assist the <strong>entity</strong> requesting <strong>the</strong> hearing and <strong>issue</strong> an appropriate summons to the person. This subsection does not limit the inherent authority of a treatment provider to alter conditions of treatment for clinical reasons, and is intended to be used only when court intervention is necessary or advisable to secure the person's compliance and prevent decompensation or deterioration;</p>

The  purpose of <strong>the</strong> evaluation <strong>is</strong> to determine whether modification, revocation, or commitment proceedings are necessary and appropriate to stabilize the person and prevent decompensation, deterioration, or physical harm. Temporary detention for evaluation under this subsection is intended to occur only following a pattern of noncompliance or the failure of reasonable attempts at outreach and engagement, and may occur only when <strong>, based on</strong> clinical judgment <strong>,</strong> temporary detention is appropriate. <strong>The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder may request assistance from a peace officer for the purposes of temporary detention under this subsection (2)(d).</strong> This subsection does not limit the ability or obligation <strong>of the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder</strong> to pursue revocation procedures under subsection (5) of this section in appropriate circumstances; and</p>

<p>Require appearance in court for periodic reviews; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the order after considering input from the agency or facility designated to provide or facilitate services.

<p>The facility or agency designated to provide outpatient treatment shall notify the secretary of the department of social and health services or designated crisis responder when a person fails to adhere to terms and conditions of court ordered treatment or experiences substantial deterioration in his or her condition and, as a result, presents an increased likelihood of serious harm.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>A</strong> person detained under this subsection (5) must be held until such time, not exceeding five days, as a hearing can be scheduled to determine whether or not the <strong>order for less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release should be revoked, modified, or retained</strong>. If the person is not detained, the hearing must be scheduled within five days of service on the person. The designated crisis responder or the secretary of the department of social and health services may <strong>withdraw its petition for revocation at any time before</strong> the court hearing.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>A</strong> person <strong>detained under this subsection (5)</strong> has the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as in any involuntary treatment proceeding, except as specifically set forth in this section. There is no right to jury trial. The venue for proceedings is the county where the petition is filed. Notice of the filing must be provided to the court that originally ordered commitment, if different from the court where the petition for revocation is filed, within two judicial days of the person's detention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The</strong> issues for the court to determine are whether: (i) The person adhered to the terms and conditions of the  order; (ii) substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred; (iii) there is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further inpatient treatment; or (iv) there is a likelihood of serious harm; and, if any of the above conditions apply, whether <strong>it is appropriate for</strong> the court <strong>to</strong> reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative <strong>treatment order</strong> or conditional release <strong>order</strong> or order the person's detention for inpatient treatment. The person may waive the court hearing and allow the court to enter a stipulated order upon the agreement of all parties. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for <strong>14</strong> days from the revocation hearing if the <strong>less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release</strong> order was based on a petition under RCW <strong>71.05.148,</strong> 71.05.160**,** or 71.05.230. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the <strong>less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release</strong> order was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.290 or 71.05.320, the number of days remaining on the  order must be converted to days of inpatient treatment . A court may not  detain a person for inpatient treatment <strong>to</strong> a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program under this subsection unless there is a  facility or  program available  with adequate space for the person.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether or not to take action under this section the designated crisis responder, agency, or facility must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.212 and the court must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.245 as they apply to the question of whether to enforce, modify, or revoke a court order for involuntary treatment.</p>
