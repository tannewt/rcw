<p>The legislature finds that youth who are Black and identify as LGBTQIA+ are most likely to be homeless in King county and across Washington state, where one-third of all homeless youth identify as LGBTQIA+ and one-third identify as Black. The legislature also finds that in addition to being the overwhelming majority of unhoused youth, they are also more likely to experience housing instability and remain most excluded from services, due to structural inequity and underlying race disparities. Further, the legislature finds that when they are offered shelter and housing placements, the placements do not reflect the cultural background or community experience of the young person.</p>
<p>The legislature, therefore, finds that providing a tax incentive to private homeowners to host a homeless youth, unaccompanied minor, and systems-impacted young adults will provide safe, transitional placement options to vulnerable young people. Moreover, this will assist in housing retention among communities of color while strengthening youth placement options and in-community housing diversity.</p>

<p>Beginning with taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2024, real property is exempt from ad valorem taxation levied for a given year if that property was used as a host home for at least 90 days in the previous calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exemption provided in (a) of this subsection applies only to the state portion of ad valorem taxation levied under RCW 84.52.065.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claim for exemption under subsection (1) of this section may be made and filed by the owner of the host home at any time during the year for exemption from taxes payable the following year upon forms as prescribed by the department. The forms must require an owner to provide sufficient evidence to support their eligibility to receive the exemption and the form may require a person to provide verification from the host home program that the real property was used as a host home as required in subsection (1) of this section. The claim for exemption must be submitted to the county assessor no later than December 31st of each year for exemption from taxes payable the following year.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The county assessor must evaluate each claim for exemption to determine an owner's eligibility for the exemption. If the county assessor finds that an owner meets the qualifications established in subsection (1) of this section, the claim for exemption must be approved. If the county assessor finds that a property does not meet the qualifications established in subsection (1) of this section, the claim for exemption must be denied, but the denial is subject to appeal under the provisions of RCW 84.48.010 and 84.40.038. The county assessor must notify the owner of either determination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claim for exemption approved under (a) of this subsection (3) is valid for one year and provides for the exemption from taxes payable in the year following the year in which the claim was due. An owner must file a new claim as provided in subsection (2) of this section for each year for which that person is eligible for the exemption.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county assessor must accept any late claim for exemption made within three years after the due date of payment of taxes for which an exemption is sought. If the county assessor approves such a claim, the application constitutes a claim for refund under chapter 84.69 RCW.</p>

Any refunds made on delinquent taxes must include the proportionate amount of interest and penalties paid. However, no refunds as a result of an incorrect payment authorized under subsection (8) of this section made by a third party payee shall be granted.
