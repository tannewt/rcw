<p>The legislature recognizes the financial impact on custodial parents and children when child support is not received on time, or in the correct amount. The legislature also recognizes the burden placed upon the responsible parent and the second family when enforcement action must be taken to collect delinquent support.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to create a central Washington state support registry to improve the recordkeeping of support obligations and payments, thereby providing protection for both parties, and reducing the burden on employers by creating a single standardized process through which support payments are deducted from earnings.</p>
<p>It is also the intent of the legislature that child support payments be made through <strong>income withholding</strong> if the responsible parent becomes delinquent in making support payments under a court or administrative order for support.</p>
<p>To that end, it is the intent of the legislature to interpret all existing statutes and processes to give effect to, and to implement, one central registry for recording and distributing support payments in this state.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The division of child support may distribute support payments to the payee under the support order or to another person who has lawful physical custody of the child or custody with the payee's consent.

<p>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (8) of this section, each insurer shall, not later than 10 days after opening a tort liability claim for bodily injury or wrongful death, a workers' compensation claim, or a claim under a policy of life insurance, exchange information with the division of child support in the manner prescribed by the department to verify whether the claimant owes debt for the support of one or more children to the department or to a person receiving services from the division of child support. To the extent feasible, the division of child support shall facilitate a secure electronic process to exchange information with insurers pursuant to this subsection. The obligation of an insurer to exchange information with the division of child support is discharged upon complying with the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p>In order to determine whether a claimant owes a debt being enforced by the division of child support, all insurance companies doing business in the state of Washington that issue qualifying payments to claimants must provide minimum identifying information about the claimant to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An insurance claim data collection organization;</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (7) of this section, if an insurer is notified by the division of child support that a claimant owes debt for the support of one or more children to the department or to a person receiving services from the division of child support, the insurer shall, upon the receipt of a notice issued by the department identifying the amount of debt owed pursuant to chapter 74.20A RCW:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Withhold from payment on the claim the amount specified in the notice; and</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any disclosure of information to the department or the division of child support; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The withholding of any money from payment on a claim or the remittance of such money to the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer may not delay the disbursement of a payment on a claim to comply with the requirements of this section. An insurer is not required to comply with subsection (4) of this section if the notice issued by the department is received by the insurer after the insurer has disbursed the payment on the claim. In the case of a claim that will be paid through periodic payments, the insurer:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Is not required to comply with the provisions of subsection (4) of this section with regard to any payments on the claim disbursed to the claimant before the notice was received by the insurer; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must comply with the provisions of subsection (4) of this section with regard to any payments on the claim scheduled to be made after the receipt of the notice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If periodic payment will be made to a claimant, an insurer is only required to engage in the exchange of information pursuant to subsection (1) of this section before issuing the initial payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurance company's failure to comply with the reporting requirements of chapter 168, Laws of 2021 does not amount to noncompliance with a requirement of the division of child support as described in RCW 74.20A.350.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A provision that orders and directs the responsible parent to make all support payments to the Washington state support registry;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits, and liens enforced against real and personal property under the child support statutes of this or any other state, without further notice to the responsible parent at any time after entry of the court order, unless:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>One of the parties demonstrates, and the court finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding and that withholding should be delayed until a payment is past due; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parties reach a written agreement that is approved by the court that provides for an alternate arrangement;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that the receiving parent might be required to submit an accounting of how the support, including any cash medical support, is being spent to benefit the child;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that any parent required to provide health care coverage for the child or children covered by the order must notify the division of child support and the other parent when the coverage terminates; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that the responsible parent's privileges to obtain and maintain a license, as defined in RCW 74.20A.320, may not be renewed, or may be suspended if the parent is not in compliance with a support order as provided in RCW 74.20A.320.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As used in this subsection and subsection (3) of this section, &quot;good cause not to require immediate income withholding&quot; means a written determination of why implementing immediate wage withholding would not be in the child's best interests and, in modification cases, proof of timely payment of previously ordered support.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In all other cases not under subsection (1) of this section, the court may order the responsible parent to make payments directly to the person entitled to receive the payments, to the Washington state support registry, or may order that payments be made in accordance with an alternate arrangement agreed upon by the parties.</p>

<li>
<p>The superior court shall include in all orders under this subsection that establish or modify a support obligation:</p>

<li>A statement that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits, and liens enforced against real and personal property under the child support statutes of this or any other state, without further notice to the responsible parent at any time after entry of the court order, unless:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) One of the parties demonstrates, and the court finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding and that withholding should be delayed until a payment is past due; or</p>
<p>(B) The parties reach a written agreement that is approved by the court that provides for an alternate arrangement;</p>
<pre><code>    ii. A statement that the receiving parent may be required to submit an accounting of how the support is being spent to benefit the child;

    iii. A statement that any parent required to provide health care coverage for the child or children covered by the order must notify the division of child support and the other parent when the coverage terminates; and

    iv. A statement that a parent seeking to enforce the obligation to provide health care coverage may:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) File a motion in the underlying superior court action; or</p>
<p>(B) If there is not already an underlying superior court action, initiate an action in the superior court.</p>
<p>As used in this subsection, &quot;good cause not to require immediate income withholding&quot; is any reason that the court finds appropriate.</p>
<pre><code>b. The superior court may order immediate or delayed income withholding as follows:

    i. Immediate income withholding may be ordered if the responsible parent has earnings. If immediate income withholding is ordered under this subsection, all support payments shall be paid to the Washington state support registry. The superior court shall issue a mandatory wage assignment order as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW when the support order is signed by the court. The parent entitled to receive the transfer payment is responsible for serving the employer with the order and for its enforcement as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW.

    ii. If immediate income withholding is not ordered, the court shall require that income withholding be delayed until a payment is past due. The support order shall contain a statement that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits, and liens enforced against real and personal property under the child support statutes of this or any other state, without further notice to the responsible parent, after a payment is past due.

c. If a mandatory **income** withholding order under chapter 26.18 RCW is issued under this subsection and the division of child support provides support enforcement services under RCW 26.23.045, the existing wage withholding assignment is prospectively superseded upon the division of child support's subsequent service of an income withholding notice.

<p>An employer, or the employment security department, upon whom <strong>an income withholding order</strong> is served, shall make an answer to the division of child support within twenty days after the date of service. The answer shall confirm compliance and institution of the payroll deduction or explain the circumstances if no payroll deduction is in effect. The answer shall also state whether the responsible parent is employed by or receives earnings from the employer or receives benefit payments from the employment security department, whether the employer or employment security department anticipates paying earnings or benefits and the amount of earnings or benefit payments.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Electronic funds transfer&quot; means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated or accomplished by conventional check, drafts, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer or magnetic tape so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to debit or credit a checking or other deposit account. &quot;Electronic funds transfer&quot; includes payments made:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>By electronic check (echeck); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By any means made available through the division of child support's web-based payment services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Income withholding order&quot; means an order to withhold income, order to withhold and deliver, or notice of payroll deduction issued under this chapter or chapter *26.10, 26.18, 74.20, or 74.20A RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Payroll processor&quot; means a person, entity, agent, or company which provides payroll services to an employer or other business such as calculating paychecks and providing electronic funds transfer services for payments to employees and other entities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an employer or other business that has received an income withholding order from the department of social and health services requiring payment to the Washington state support registry must remit payments through electronic funds transfer when the following conditions apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The income withholding order applies to a person who is either an employee or contractor of the business, and the employer or business has:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Ten or more employees; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ten or more contractors;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employer or business has received an income withholding order for more than one employee or contractor, even if the employer or business has fewer than ten employees or contractors, but has received an income withholding order for more than one employee or contractor;</p>

<li>
<p>The employer or business uses a payroll processor to handle its payroll, payment, and tax processes and the payroll processor has the capacity to transmit payments through electronic funds transfer; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employer or business is required by the department of revenue to file and pay taxes electronically under RCW 82.32.080.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All electronic funds transfer payments must identify the person from whom the payment was withheld, the amount of the payment, the person's identifying number assigned by the division of child support, or the division of child support case number to which the payment is to be applied. If a business, employer, or payroll processor required to remit payments by electronic funds transfer under this section fails to comply with this requirement, the division of child support may issue a notice of noncompliance pursuant to RCW 74.20A.350.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may waive the requirement to remit payments electronically for a business, employer, or payroll processor that is unable to comply despite good faith efforts or due to circumstances beyond that entity's reasonable control. Grounds for approving a waiver include, but are not limited to, circumstances in which:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The business, employer, or payroll processor does not have a computer that meets the minimum standards necessary for electronic remittance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional time is needed to program the entity's computer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The business, employer, or payroll processor does not currently file data electronically with any business or government agency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance conflicts with the entity's business procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliance would cause a financial hardship.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>The business, employer, or payroll processor has submitted at least one dishonored check; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The business, employer, or payroll processor continues to incorrectly identify withholdings or makes other errors that affect proper distribution of the support, despite contact and information from the department on how to correct the error.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department of social and health services has rule-making authority to enact rules in compliance with this section, including, but not limited to:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may serve a notice of support owed for day care or child care on the person required by the order to make the transfer payment when:</p>

<li>
<p>The underlying support order requires that person to pay his or her proportionate share of day care or child care costs directly to the person entitled to receive support; or</p>

<li>
<p>The department may serve a notice of support owed for medical support on any person obligated by a child support order to provide medical support for the child or children covered by the order. There are two different types of medical support obligations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Health care coverage: The department may serve a notice of support owed to determine an obligated person's monthly payment toward the premium as defined in RCW 26.09.105, if the support order does not set a fixed dollar amount for the monthly payment toward the premium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uninsured medical expenses: The department may serve a notice of support owed on any person who is obligated to pay a portion of uninsured medical costs, copayments, or deductibles incurred on behalf of the child or children covered by the order, when the support order does not reduce the costs to a fixed dollar amount.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The notice of support owed may be served for purposes of reimbursing a person who has paid the share of uninsured medical expenses owed by any person obligated to contribute to those costs;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The notice of support owed may be served for both purposes listed in this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice of support owed is intended to facilitate enforcement of the support order and implement and effectuate the terms of the support order, rather than modify those terms. When the department issues a notice of support owed, the department must inform the payee under the support order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service of the notice of support owed must be as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An initial notice of support owed must be served on the person required by the order to pay support or contribute to costs by personal service or any form of mailing requiring a return receipt. The initial notice may be served on the person who is entitled to receive the support covered by the notice, as well as the payee under the order if appropriate, by regular mail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A notice of support owed created for purposes of reviewing an ongoing support obligation established by a prior notice of support owed may be served on the person required by the order to pay support or contribute to costs by regular mail to that person's last known address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An initial notice of support owed, as well as any notice created for purposes of reviewing an ongoing support obligation established by a prior notice of support owed may be served on the person entitled to receive the support by regular mail to that person's last known address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice of support owed must contain:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An initial finding of the fixed dollar amount of current and future support obligation that should be paid or the fixed dollar amount of the support debt owed under the support order, or both; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that any subsequent notice of support owed created for purposes of reviewing the amounts established by the current notice may be served on any party to the order by regular mail to that person's last known address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who objects to the fixed dollar amounts stated in the notice of support owed has twenty days from the date of the service of the notice of support owed to file an application for an adjudicative proceeding or initiate an action in superior court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice of support owed must state that the person may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>File an application for an adjudicative proceeding governed by chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act, in which the person will be required to appear and show cause why the fixed dollar amount of support debt or current and future support obligation, or both, stated in the notice of support owed is incorrect and should not be ordered; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiate an action in superior court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no person included in the notice files an application for an adjudicative proceeding or initiates an action in superior court, the fixed dollar amount of current and future support obligation or support debt, or both, stated in the notice of support owed becomes final and subject to collection action.</p>

<li>
<p>If an adjudicative proceeding is requested, the office of administrative hearings must schedule a hearing. All persons included in the notice are entitled to participate in the hearing with full party rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no person included in the notice initiates an action in superior court, and serves notice of the action on the department and the other party to the support order within the twenty-day period, all persons included in the notice must be deemed to have made an election of remedies and must exhaust administrative remedies under this chapter with judicial review available as provided for in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An administrative order entered in accordance with this section must state:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The basis, rationale, or formula upon which the fixed dollar amounts established in the order were based;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fixed dollar amount of current and future support obligation or the amount of the support debt, or both, determined under this section is subject to collection under this chapter and other applicable state statutes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That any subsequent notice of support owed created for purposes of reviewing the amounts established by the current notice may be served on any party to the order by regular mail to that person's last known address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must also provide for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An annual review of the support order if the department, the person required to pay support, the payee under the order, or the person entitled to receive support requests such a review; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A late hearing if a person included in the notice fails to file an application for an adjudicative proceeding in a timely manner under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an annual review is requested under subsection (13) of this section, the department may serve the notice of annual review of the administrative order based on the prior notice of support owed by mailing a copy of the notice by regular mail to the last known address of all parties to the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one of the parties requests a late hearing under subsection (13) of this section, the office of administrative hearings must schedule an adjudicative proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An annual review under subsection (13) of this section is used to determine whether the expense remained the same, increased[,] or decreased, and whether there is a discrepancy between the actual expense and the amount determined under the prior notice of support owed.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If a change in the actual expense which was the basis for the most recent notice of support owed occurs before twelve months pass, any party to the order may request that the department accelerate the annual review described in subsection (13) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may review any evidence presented by the person claiming that the expense has occurred and determine whether the change is likely to create a significant overpayment or underpayment if the department does not serve a new notice of support owed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under appropriate circumstances, the department may accelerate the time for the review and serve a notice of support owed even if twelve months have not passed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enact rules consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 652(f) and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 666(a)(19) as amended by section 7307 of the deficit reduction act of 2005;</p>

<p>The department shall be given twenty calendar days prior notice of the entry of any final order and five days prior notice of the entry of any temporary order in any proceeding involving child support or maintenance if the department has a financial interest based on an assignment of support rights under RCW 74.20.330 or the state has a subrogated interest under RCW 74.20A.030. Service of this notice upon the department shall be by personal service on, or mailing by any form of mail requiring a return receipt to, the office of the attorney general; except that notice shall be given to the office of the prosecuting attorney for the county in which the action is filed in lieu of the office of the attorney general in those counties and in the types of cases as designated by the office of the attorney general by letter sent to the presiding superior court judge of that county.

<p>The federal personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996, P.L. 104-193, requires states to collect social security numbers as part of the application process for professional licenses, driver's licenses, occupational licenses, and recreational licenses. The legislature finds that if social security numbers are accessible to the public, it will be relatively easy for someone to use another's social security number fraudulently to assume that person's identity and gain access to bank accounts, credit services, billing information, driving history, and other sources of personal information. Public Law 104-193 could compound and exacerbate the disturbing trend of social security number-related fraud. In order to prevent fraud and curtail invasions of privacy, the governor, through the department of social and health services, shall seek a waiver to the federal mandate to record social security numbers on applications for professional, driver's, occupational, and recreational licenses. If a waiver is not granted, the licensing agencies shall collect and disclose social security numbers as required under RCW 26.23.150.</p>

<p>In order to assist in child support enforcement as required by federal law, all applicants for an original, replacement, or renewal of a professional license, commercial driver's license, occupational license, or recreational license must furnish the licensing agency with the applicant's social security number, which shall be recorded on the application. No applicant for an original, replacement, or renewal noncommercial driver's license is required to furnish the licensing agency with the applicant's social security number for purposes of assisting in child support enforcement prior to the time necessary to comply with the *federal deadline. The licensing agencies collecting social security numbers shall not display the social security number on the license document. Social security numbers collected by licensing agencies shall not be disclosed except as required by state or federal law or under RCW 26.23.120.</p>
