<p>The legislature finds that economic inequality continues to widen the gap between the top few earners and working and low-income families. The legislature recognizes that wages have failed to keep pace with the cost of living. The legislature finds that centuries of discriminatory policies have resulted especially in black and African American, American Indian and Alaskan Native, Hispanic or Latinx, and other households of color having significantly lower median incomes than white and Asian households.</p>
<p>The legislature declares that all Washington households deserve basic financial security and that it is the goal of the state of Washington to ensure economic sustainability for all families. The legislature finds that direct cash assistance is one of the most effective ways to increase financial stability among people and families struggling to cover essential expenses. The legislature finds that flexible cash assistance allows recipients to choose how to allocate funds in order to best care for themselves and meet the particular needs of their families.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that direct cash assistance is a policy solution that will advance racial wealth equity and has been promoted by black leaders for many decades, including Martin Luther King Jr., the black panther party, and the national welfare rights organization. In addition, the legislature finds that a substantial body of evidence suggests that direct cash assistance reduces poverty, increases economic mobility, and improves health and well-being.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that communities are leading local guaranteed basic income pilot projects across Washington state, and that the Washington state department of social and health services is currently completing a feasibility study jointly with the poverty reduction work group and a steering committee of people and communities historically excluded from social and economic well-being on a statewide universal basic income pilot program.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to advance a statewide guaranteed basic income program that builds on the experience of locally based, community driven pilot programs and the statewide feasibility study.</p>
<p>The legislature further intends that income received from this and other basic income programs not impact eligibility for other benefits like food assistance or child care.</p>
