<p>Additionally, state grants may be made to counties for preparation of a comprehensive flood control management plan required to be prepared under RCW 86.26.050.</p>

<li>
<p>State participation shall be in such preparation of comprehensive flood control management plans under this chapter and chapter 86.12 RCW, cost sharing feasibility studies for new flood control projects, projects pursuant to section 33, chapter 322, Laws of 1991, and flood control maintenance projects as are affected with a general public and state interest, as differentiated from a private interest, and as are likely to bring about public benefits commensurate with the amount of state funds allocated thereto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No participation for flood control maintenance projects may occur with a county or other municipal corporation unless the director of ecology has approved the floodplain management activities of the county, city, or town having planning jurisdiction over the area where the flood control maintenance project will be, on the one hundred year floodplain surrounding such area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The department of ecology shall adopt rules concerning the floodplain management activities of a county, city, or town that are adequate to protect or preclude flood damage to structures, works, and improvements, including the restriction of land uses within a river's meander belt or floodway to only flood-compatible uses. Whenever the department has approved county, city, and town floodplain management activities, as a condition of receiving an allocation of funds under this chapter, each revision to the floodplain management activities must be approved by the department of ecology, in consultation with the department of fish and wildlife.</p>
<p>No participation with a county or other municipal corporation for flood control maintenance projects may occur unless the county engineer of the county within which the flood control maintenance project is located certifies that a comprehensive flood control management plan has been completed and adopted by the appropriate local authority, or is being prepared for all portions of the river basin or other area, within which the project is located in that county, that are subject to flooding with a frequency of one hundred years or less.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Participation for flood control maintenance projects and preparation of comprehensive flood control management plans shall be made from grants made by the department of ecology from the flood control assistance account. Comprehensive flood control management plans, and any revisions to the plans, must be approved by the department of ecology, in consultation with the department of fish and wildlife. The department may only grant financial assistance to local governments that, in the opinion of the department, are making good faith efforts to take advantage of, or comply with, federal and state flood control programs.</li>

Grants for cost sharing feasibility studies for new flood control projects shall not exceed fifty percent of the matching funds that are required by the federal government, and shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the total costs of the feasibility study. However, grants to prepare a comprehensive flood control management plan required under RCW 86.26.050 shall not exceed seventy-five percent of the full planning costs, but not to exceed amounts for either purpose specified in rule and regulation by the department of ecology.</p>
