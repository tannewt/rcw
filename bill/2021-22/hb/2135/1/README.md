## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Ukrainians are the largest group of European residents in Washington and that from 2000 to 2019 Washington's Ukrainian population grew 69 percent.

2. Russia has engaged in an unjustified and unprovoked invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine, in violation of international law.

3. Washington stands firmly in support of Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity and strongly condemns Russia's military actions against Ukraine.

4. Preventing Washington's own investment activity, whether directly or indirectly, from giving aid to Russia as it commits these violations of international law and human rights violations against the Ukrainian people is a compelling state interest.

5. Protecting Washington from financing discrimination against the Ukrainian people is a compelling state interest.

    a. Headquartered in Russia or has its principal place of business in Russia; or

    b. Providing assistance to the Russian government in its campaign to invade the sovereign country of Ukraine, either through in-kind support or for-profit support.

3. A state agency may contract with an entity described under subsection (2)(a) and (b) of this section if the head of the agency makes a determination in writing that the contract is necessary for the agency to perform its functions and that no suitable contractual alternative exists.
