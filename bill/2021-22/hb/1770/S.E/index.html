<p>In order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in RCW 70A.45.020, the state must require construction of increasingly low-emission energy efficient homes and buildings and achieve construction of zero fossil-fuel greenhouse gas emission homes and buildings by 2030. Top categories of clean energy jobs in the buildings sector include: High-efficiency heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; energy efficiency technologies; and renewable heating and cooling. As the fastest growing clean energy industries in our state, work in these areas also supports job creation in other construction trades, which is a critical component of a clean energy economic recovery strategy.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, residential and nonresidential construction  must achieve <strong>the following:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>A reduction of at least 70 percent in annual net energy consumption under the residential and nonresidential energy codes that are adopted by the council by December 1, 2031, using the adopted 2006 Washington state energy code as a baseline; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New buildings must be net-zero ready, including a reduction of at least 80 percent in annual net energy consumption using the adopted 2006 Washington state energy code as a baseline and must include wiring for electrical raceways and designated space for solar equipment for photovoltaic panel installation under the residential and nonresidential state energy codes that are adopted by the council by December 1, 2034. The state building code council shall further define and include net-zero ready measures in the code adoption process, including exemptions for either construction sites or buildings, or both, that do not have adequate solar exposure to justify the installation of solar ready measures</strong>. <strong>The 80 percent reduction requirement does not apply to the increased load for electronic vehicle charging.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The council shall adopt state energy codes from 2013 through 2031 that incrementally move towards achieving the seventy percent reduction in annual net energy consumption <strong>requirements</strong> as specified in subsection (1) of this section. The council shall report its progress by December 31, 2012, and every three years thereafter. If the council determines that economic, technological, or process factors would significantly impede adoption of or compliance with this subsection, the council may defer the implementation of the proposed energy code update and shall report its findings to the legislature by December 31st of the year prior to the year in which those codes would otherwise be enacted.</p>

<li>
<p>The council shall follow the legislature's standards set forth in this section to adopt rules to be known as the Washington state energy code. The Washington state energy code shall be designed to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Construct increasingly energy efficient homes and buildings that help achieve the broader goal of building zero fossil-fuel greenhouse gas emission homes and buildings by the year 2031; <strong>and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require new buildings to meet a certain level of energy efficiency, but allow flexibility in building design, construction, and heating equipment efficiencies within that framework</p>

<p>The Washington state energy code shall take into account regional climatic conditions. One climate zone includes: Adams, Asotin, Benton, Chelan, Columbia, Douglas, Ferry, Franklin, Garfield, Grant, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla, Whitman, and Yakima counties. The other climate zone includes all other counties not listed in this subsection (3). The assignment of a county to a climate zone may not be changed by adoption of a model code or rule. Nothing in this section prohibits the council from adopting the same rules or standards for each climate zone.</p>

<p><strong>The state building code council must adopt by rule a statewide residential reach code for optional adoption and enforcement by any city, town, or county. The statewide residential reach code must achieve the 70 percent reduction in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions required in the 2030 energy code for residential buildings under RCW 19.27A.160 in incremental steps by the 2027 energy code. The department of commerce shall develop a proposal covering the technical provisions of the reach code and the rule-making documents required by RCW 34.05.328. The state building code council must adopt the statewide residential reach code as an appendix to the 2021 residential energy code to be effective by July 1, 2024</strong>.</p>
