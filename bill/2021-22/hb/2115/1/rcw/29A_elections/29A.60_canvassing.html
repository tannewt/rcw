<ol>
<li>
<p>For any office, except precinct committee officer, at any election or primary, any voter may write in on the ballot the name of any person for an office. Votes must be individually tallied for a candidate who has filed as a write-in candidate for the office in the manner provided by RCW 29A.24.311 as long as the requirements of subsection (6), (7), or (8) of this section are met. No write-in vote for a declared write-in candidate may be rejected due to variation in the form of the name if the canvassing board can determine the person and office for which the voter intended to vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total number of write-in votes cast for each office must be recorded and reported with the canvass for the election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A write-in vote for an individual candidate for an office whose name is printed on the ballot for that same office is a valid vote for that candidate as long as the candidate's name is clearly discernible, even if the voter also marked a vote for that candidate such as to otherwise register an overvote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write-in votes cast for an individual candidate for an office whose name does not appear on the ballot need not be individually tallied unless the candidate has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of write-in candidates for a statewide office or any office whose jurisdiction encompasses more than one county, write-in votes for an individual candidate must be tallied when the county auditor is notified by the filing officer for that office that a candidate has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy. In all other cases, the county auditor determines, in accordance with this section, whether a candidate has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy and thus, write-in votes must be individually tallied. The county canvassing board must certify write-in votes including the vote total received by a candidate that has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy if the requirements of subsection (6), (7), or (8) of this section are met. Final results must consolidate the vote total associated with each candidate after the canvassing board has reconciled any variation in the spelling of names for those candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a primary, if the name of only a single candidate appears on the ballot for an office, and the total number of write-in votes cast for that office exceeds one percent of the total number of votes cast for that office, the individual write-in votes for each candidate who has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy must be canvassed and reported. Otherwise, individual tallying of write-in votes is not required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a primary, if two or more candidates appear on the ballot for an office and the total number of write-in votes cast for that office exceeds the number of votes cast for the candidate with the second highest number of votes, then the individual write-in votes for each candidate who has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy must be canvassed and reported. Otherwise, individual tallying of write-in votes is not required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a general election, if the total number of write-in votes cast for an office exceeds the number of votes cast for the candidate apparently elected to that office, then the individual write-in votes for each candidate who has filed a timely declaration of write-in candidacy must be canvassed and reported. Otherwise, individual tallying of write-in votes is not required.</p>

<p>A ballot is invalid and no votes on that ballot may be counted if it is found folded together with another ballot.</p>
<p>Those parts of a ballot are invalid and no votes may be counted for those issues or offices where more votes are cast for the office or issue than are permitted by law; write-in votes do not contain all of the information required under RCW 29A.60.021; or that issue or office is not marked with sufficient definiteness to determine the voter's choice or intention. No write-in vote may be rejected due to a variation in the form of the name if the canvassing board can determine the issue for or against which or the person and the office for which the voter intended to vote.</p>

<p><strong>Prior to the certification of the general election, a full forensic audit of the general election must be conducted in accordance with section 2 of this act.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to certification of the <strong>primary and special</strong> election , the county auditor shall conduct an audit of duplicated ballots in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, and an audit using at minimum <strong>two</strong> of the following methods:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An audit of results of votes cast on the direct recording electronic voting devices, or other in-person ballot marking systems, used in the county if there are races or issues with more than ten votes cast on all direct recording electronic voting devices or other in-person ballot marking systems in the county. This audit must be conducted by randomly selecting by lot up to <strong>50</strong> percent of the direct recording electronic voting devices or other in-person ballot marking systems, or one direct recording electronic voting device or other in-person ballot marking system, whichever is greater, and, for each device or system, comparing the results recorded electronically with the results recorded on paper. For purposes of this audit, the results recorded on paper must be tabulated as follows: On <strong>50 percent</strong> of the devices or systems selected for audit, the paper records must be tabulated manually; on the remaining devices or systems, the paper records may be tabulated by a mechanical device determined by the <strong>state auditor</strong> to be capable of accurately reading the votes cast and printed thereon and qualified for use in the state under applicable state and federal laws. <strong>The mayoral contest with the most votes cast, one randomly selected local government council contest, and at least one additional randomly selected ballot contest</strong> must be audited on each device or system. <strong>If in any particular election there is no mayoral contest, the county auditor shall randomly select another local government council race to audit.</strong> This audit procedure must be subject to observation <strong>in accordance with subsection (6) of this section</strong>. As used in this subsection, &quot;in-person ballot marking system&quot; or &quot;system&quot; means an in-person ballot marking system that retains or produces an electronic voting record of each vote cast using the system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A random check of the ballot counting equipment <strong>for accuracy</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A risk-limiting audit. A &quot;risk-limiting audit&quot; means an audit protocol that makes use of statistical principles and methods <strong>which produce the most accurate outcome and are consistent with the highest industry standards</strong> and is designed to limit the risk of certifying an incorrect election outcome.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>The state auditor shall set</strong> the risk limit. A &quot;risk limit&quot; means the largest statistical probability that an incorrect reported tabulation outcome is not detected in a risk-limiting audit**.**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The county auditor shall randomly</strong> select for audit <strong>the mayoral race with the most votes cast, one local government council race selected at random</strong>, and  at least one ballot contest . The county auditor shall randomly select <strong>another local government council race</strong> for audit if in any particular election there is no <strong>mayoral</strong> contest**.**</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The state auditor shall establish</strong> procedures for implementation of risk-limiting audits, including random selection of the audit sample, determination of audit size, and procedures for a comparison risk-limiting audit and ballot polling risk-limiting audit as defined in (c)(iii)(A) and (B) of this subsection. <strong>The audit sample and size must be sufficiently large and consistent with industry best practices proven to yield accurate results.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) In a comparison risk-limiting audit, the county auditor compares the voter markings on randomly selected ballots to the ballot-level cast vote record produced by the ballot counting equipment.</p>
<p>(B) In a ballot polling risk-limiting audit, the county auditor of a county using ballot counting equipment that does not produce ballot-level cast vote records reports the voter markings on randomly selected ballots until the prespecified risk limit is met; or</p>
<pre><code>d. An independent electronic audit of the original ballot counting equipment used in the county. The county auditor may either conduct an audit of all ballots cast, or limit the audit to **five percent of the** precincts or **12** batches pursuant to procedures **established by the state auditor**. This audit must be conducted using an independent electronic audit system that is, at minimum:

    i. Approved by the **state auditor**;

    ii. Completely independent from all voting systems, including ballot counting equipment, that is used in the county;

    iii. **Not connected to the internet, and incapable of connecting to any wireless, bluetooth, universal serial bus, or similar exterior drives which may compromise data;**

    iv. Distributed or manufactured by a vendor different from the vendor that distributed or manufactured the original ballot counting equipment; and

v. Capable of demonstrating that it can verify and confirm the **logic and** accuracy of the original ballot counting equipment's reported results.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Prior to certification of the election, the county auditor must conduct an audit of ballots duplicated under RCW 29A.60.125. The audit of duplicated ballots must involve a comparison of the duplicated ballot to the original ballot. The <strong>state auditor</strong> must establish procedures for the auditing of duplicated ballots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each audit method <strong>included in this section</strong>, the <strong>state auditor</strong> must adopt procedures <strong>no later than six months before the primary, general election, or special election</strong> for expanding the audit to include additional ballots when an audit results in a discrepancy. The procedure must specify under what circumstances a discrepancy will lead to an audit of additional ballots, and the method to determine how many additional ballots will be selected. The <strong>state auditor</strong> shall <strong>also</strong> adopt procedures <strong>no later than six months before the primary, general election, or special election for investigating</strong> the cause of any discrepancy found during an audit**, which must include an investigation by the state election audit board for any discrepancies found in a general election**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>state auditor</strong> must establish rules  to implement and administer the auditing methods in this section<strong>which must include</strong> public observation <strong>in accordance with subsection (6) of this section</strong> and <strong>detailed</strong> reporting requirements <strong>to ensure proper transparency and accountability to the voters</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All audits performed pursuant to this section must be open to observation by the candidates on the ballot or the candidate's designated representatives, ballot issue representatives on file with the county auditor or the representatives' designees, and political party observers, and made available to a minimum of 20 county residents per day who have resided and been registered to vote in the county for at least 12 months prior to the election that is being audited. The county auditor shall notify the candidates, ballot issue representatives, and political party observers of the audit in writing at least two weeks prior to the audit. The county auditor shall publish a notice two weeks before each audit announcing the audit, including the date, time, and location of the audit; a clearly stated purpose; and an invitation to the public to attend and observe the audit. The notice must be prominently displayed and readily visible on the county auditor's website, or county website if the county auditor does not have one, and published in newspapers with the largest and, if applicable, second largest readership in the county and be of a size which occupies at least one-eighth of a page.</strong></p>

<p>The legislature finds that certain laws are in conflict governing the assumption of office of various local officials. The purpose of this section is to provide a common date for the assumption of office for all the elected officials of counties, cities, towns, and special purpose districts other than school districts where the ownership of property is not a prerequisite of voting. A person elected to the office of school director begins his or her term of office at the first official meeting of the board of directors after certification of the election results. It is also the purpose of this section to remove these conflicts and delete old statutory language concerning such elections which is no longer necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For elective offices of counties, cities, towns, and special purpose districts other than school districts where the ownership of property is not a prerequisite of voting, the term of incumbents ends and the term of successors begins after the successor is elected and qualified, and the term commences immediately after December 31st following the election, except as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Where the term of office varies from this standard according to statute; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the election results have not been certified prior to January 1st after the election, in which event the time of commencement for the new term occurs when the successor becomes qualified in accordance with RCW 29A.04.133.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For elective offices governed by this section, the oath of office must be taken as the last step of qualification as defined in RCW 29A.04.133 but may be taken either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Up to ten days prior to the scheduled date of assuming office; or</p>

A manual hand count of each ballot by batch shall be conducted by the third-party audit vendor to ensure the ballots were properly counted and tallied. If the manual hand count total is different than the total from the vote tallying system, a second manual hand count of the ballots must occur. If the second manual hand count matches the first manual hand count, then that outcome must be used to certify the election. If the second manual hand count matches the total from the vote tallying system, then the total from the vote tallying system must be used to certify the election. If the second manual ballot hand count does not match the first manual ballot hand count or the total from the vote tallying system, then the state election audit board shall investigate the cause of the discrepancy and determine the accurate count of the votes before the date of the certification of the election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voter registration database. (i) The third-party audit vendor shall audit the voter registration database and create a log of voter registrations added to the database, revisions made to existing voter information in the voter registration database, and cancellations of voter registrations, made between January 1st of the year being audited and the date the audit is commenced.
