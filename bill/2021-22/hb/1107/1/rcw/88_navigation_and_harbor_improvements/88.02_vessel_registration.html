<p>General fees for vessel registrations collected by the director must be deposited in the general fund. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, any amount above one million one hundred thousand dollars per fiscal year must be allocated to counties by the state treasurer for boating safety/education and law enforcement programs. Eligibility for boating safety/education and law enforcement program allocations is contingent upon approval of the local boating safety program by the state parks and recreation commission. Fund allocation must be based on the numbers of registered vessels by county of moorage. Each benefiting county is responsible for equitable distribution of such allocation to other jurisdictions with approved boating safety programs within the county. Any fees not allocated to counties due to the absence of an approved boating safety program must be allocated to the state parks and recreation commission for awards to local governments to offset law enforcement and boating safety impacts of boaters recreating in jurisdictions other than where registered. Jurisdictions receiving funds under this section shall deposit the funds into an account dedicated solely for supporting the jurisdiction's boating safety programs. These funds may not replace existing local funds used for boating safety programs.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the director may by order deny, suspend, or revoke a vessel dealer license, or in lieu of or in addition to, may by order assess monetary penalties of a civil nature not to exceed one thousand dollars per violation, if the director finds that the applicant or licensee:</p>

<li>
<p>Is applying for a dealer's license or has obtained a dealer's license for the purpose of evading excise taxes on vessels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has been adjudged guilty of a felony that directly relates to marine trade and the time elapsed since the adjudication is less than ten years. For purposes of this section, &quot;adjudged guilty&quot; means, in addition to a final conviction in court, an unvacated forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure a defendant's appearance in court, the payment of a fine, a plea of guilty, or a finding of guilt regardless of whether the sentence is deferred or the penalty is suspended;</p>

<p>Has failed to comply with applicable provisions of this chapter or any rules adopted under it.</p>

<li>
<p>The director may deny a vessel dealer license under this chapter if the application is a subterfuge that conceals the real person in interest whose vessel dealer license has been denied, suspended, or revoked for cause under this chapter and (a) the terms have not been fulfilled or a civil penalty has not been paid or (b) the director finds that the application was not filed in good faith. This subsection does not prevent the department from taking an action against a current vessel dealer licensee.</p>
