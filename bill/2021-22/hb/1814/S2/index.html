<p>The legislature finds and declares that stimulating local investment in community solar projects continues to be an important part of a state energy strategy by helping to increase energy independence from fossil fuels, promote economic development, hedge against the effects of climate change, and attain environmental benefits. The legislature finds that although previous community solar programs were successful in stimulating these benefits, the programs failed to provide an adequate framework for low-income participation and long-term market certainty. The legislature finds that the vast majority of Washingtonians still do not have access to the benefits of solar energy. The legislature intends to stimulate the deployment of community solar projects for the benefit of all Washingtonians by funding the renewable energy production incentive program for community solar projects and by creating opportunities for broader participation, especially by low-income households and low-income service providers. As of December 2021, the state is 10.3 megawatts short of the 115 megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity established as a goal under RCW 82.16.155. The legislature therefore intends to provide an incentive sufficient to promote installation of community solar projects through June 30, 2033, at which point the legislature expects to review the effectiveness of enhancing access to community solar projects.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2033, an administrator of a community solar project meeting the eligibility requirements described in this section and RCW 82.16.170(3) may submit an application to the Washington State University extension energy program to receive a precertification for a community solar project. Projects with precertification applications approved by the Washington State University extension energy program have two years to complete their projects and apply for certification. Projects that have not completed certification within two years may apply to the Washington State University extension energy program for an extension of their precertification status for an additional 180 days if they can demonstrate significant progress during the time they were in precertification status. By certifying qualified projects pursuant to the requirements of this section and RCW 82.16.170(3), the Washington State University extension energy program authorizes the utility serving the site of a community solar project in the state of Washington to remit a one-time low-income community solar incentive payment to the community solar project administrator, who accepts the payment on behalf of, and for the purpose of providing direct benefits to, the project's qualifying subscribers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A one-time low-income community solar incentive payment remitted to a community solar project administrator for a project certified under this section equals the sum of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An amount, not to exceed $20,000 per community solar project, equal to the community solar project's administrative costs related to the administrative start-up of the project for qualifying subscribers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An amount that does not exceed 100 percent of the proportional cost of the installed cost of the share of the community solar project that provides direct benefits to qualifying subscribers, taking into account any federal tax credits or other federal or nonfederal grants or incentives that the program is benefiting from.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No new certification may be issued under this section for a community solar project that was certified under RCW 82.16.120 or 82.16.165, or for a community solar project served by a utility that has elected not to participate in the incentive program provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community solar projects that are under precertification status under RCW 82.16.165 as of June 30, 2020, may not apply for precertification of that same project for the one-time low-income community solar incentive payment provided in this section.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In addition to the one-time low-income community solar incentive payment under subsection (2) of this section, a participating utility must also provide the following compensation for the generation of electricity from the certified project:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For a community solar project that has an alternating current nameplate capacity no greater than 100 kilowatts, and that is connected behind the electric service meter, compensation must be determined in accordance with RCW 80.60.020 and provided to the retail electric customer receiving service at the situs of the meter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other community solar projects for which the administrator is not a utility, compensation must be determined and paid to the retail electric customer according to a written agreement between the retail electric customer and the utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other community solar projects for which the administrator is a utility, compensation must be provided directly to subscribers in accordance with subsection (8)(a)(i) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>iv.(A) When the administrator of a community solar project receives compensation for the generation of electricity from a participating utility or from the retail electric customer that is the host for the community solar project, the administrator must provide all of that compensation as a direct benefit to the project subscribers, except as described in (iv)(B) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) An administrator may deduct ongoing administrative and maintenance costs from compensation they provide to subscribers from power generation, provided those costs are identified in the subscription agreement or justified to the Washington State University extension energy program. The Washington State University extension energy program shall review any such administrative and maintenance costs justifications for reasonableness and approve, reject, or negotiate changes to the proposal. An administrator may request a change in the deduction for administrative and maintenance costs to the Washington State University extension energy program only if the subscription agreement includes language notifying the subscriber that administrative and maintenance fees are subject to change.</p>
<pre><code>b. For 10 years after certification, and by March 1st of each year following certification, the administrator must provide the Washington State University extension energy program with signed statements of the following for the preceding year:

    i. The energy production for the period for which compensation is to be provided;

    ii. Each subscriber's units of the project;

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of community solar programs is to facilitate broad, equitable community investment in and access to solar power. Beginning July 1, 2017, a community solar administrator may organize and administer a community solar project as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In order to receive certification for the incentive payment provided under RCW 82.16.165(1) by June 30, 2021, a</strong> community solar project must have a direct current nameplate capacity that is no more than one thousand kilowatts and must have at least ten participants or <strong>at least</strong> one participant for every ten kilowatts of direct current nameplate capacity, whichever is greater. A community solar project that has a direct current nameplate capacity greater than five hundred kilowatts must be subject to a standard interconnection agreement with the utility serving the situs of the community solar project. Except for community solar projects authorized under subsection (10) of this section, each participant must be a customer of the utility providing service at the situs of the community solar project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In order to receive certification for the incentive payment provided under section 5 of this act beginning July 1, 2022, a community solar project must meet the following requirements:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>The administrator of the community solar project must be a utility, nonprofit, or tribal housing authority that administers a community solar project on tribal lands or lands held in trust for a federally recognized tribe by the United States for subscribers who are tribal members, or other local housing authority. The administrator of the community solar project must apply for precertification under section 5 of this act on or after July 1, 2022;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The community solar project must have a direct current nameplate capacity that is greater than 12 kilowatts but no greater than 1,000 kilowatts, and must have at least two subscribers or one low-income service provider subscriber;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The administrator of the community solar project must provide a verified list of qualifying subscribers;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification that an individual household subscriber meets the definition of low-income must be provided to the administrator by an entity with authority to maintain the confidentiality of the income status of the low-income subscriber. If the providing entity incurs costs to verify a subscriber's income status, the administrator must provide reimbursement of those costs;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Except for community solar projects authorized under subsection (10) of this section, each subscriber must be a customer of the utility providing service at the site of the community solar project;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In the event that a low-income subscriber in a community solar project certified under section 5 of this act moves within 120 months of system certification from the household premises of the subscriber's current subscription to another, the subscriber may continue the subscription, provided that the new household premises is served by the utility providing service at the site of the community solar project. In the event that a subscriber is no longer served by that utility or the subscriber terminates participation in a community solar project certified under section 5 of this act, the certification follows the system and participation must be transferred by the administrator to a new qualifying subscriber as specified in section 5 of this act;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The administrator must include in the application for precertification a project prospectus that demonstrates how the administrator intends to provide direct benefits to qualifying subscribers for the duration of their subscription to the community solar project; and</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Except for parties engaged in actions and transactions regulated under laws administered by other authorities and exempted under RCW 19.86.170, a violation of this section constitutes an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce in violation of chapter 19.86 RCW, the consumer protection act. Acts in violation of chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. are not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business, and constitute matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
