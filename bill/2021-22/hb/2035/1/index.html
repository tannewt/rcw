<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many behavioral health disorders are preventable. There are three factors that, when taken together, will frequently result in a person developing substance use disorder: (a) A susceptible organism; (b) stress; and (c) the introduction of an addictive substance. While it is imperative that the state address all three factors, there is one state agency that plays a central role regarding (c) of this subsection. The liquor and cannabis board develops and implements the policies that dictate access and exposure to addictive substances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that while different racial groups use substances at similar rates, behavioral health treatment penetration rates in communities of color are lower than in white communities. People of color experience lower rates of participation in behavioral health treatment and shorter treatment duration. There are a myriad of reasons for this, including practical barriers such as transportation and child care, and a lack of culturally appropriate behavioral health providers. Washington state has a long history of concentrating the sale of addictive substances in communities of color. This is true for tobacco, it was true for alcohol before liquor sales were privatized, and it is true for cannabis. Communities of color face the greatest exposure to sales and advertising of addictive substances and yet are the furthest from access to treatment for the behavioral health conditions that frequently result from the use of those substances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to advance prevention and address health disparities by requiring the liquor and cannabis board to apply a behavioral health prevention and equity impact framework regarding the regulation of alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, and vapor products. The legislature further intends to ensure the meaningful participation of overburdened communities, vulnerable populations, communities of color, youth, families, and the prevention community in the development of policies governing the sale, use, and advertising of addictive substances.</p>
