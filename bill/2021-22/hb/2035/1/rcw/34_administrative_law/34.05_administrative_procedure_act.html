<p>The legislature intends, by enacting this 1988 Administrative Procedure Act, to clarify the existing law of administrative procedure, to achieve greater consistency with other states and the federal government in administrative procedure, and to provide greater public and legislative access to administrative decision making. The legislature intends that to the greatest extent possible and unless this chapter clearly requires otherwise, current agency practices and court decisions interpreting the Administrative Procedure Act in effect before July 1, 1989, shall remain in effect. The legislature also intends that the courts should interpret provisions of this chapter consistently with decisions of other courts interpreting similar provisions of other states, the federal government, and model acts.</p>

<p>In addition to other rule-making requirements imposed by law:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each agency may adopt rules governing the formal and informal procedures prescribed or authorized by this chapter and rules of practice before the agency, together with forms and instructions.

</li>
<li>
<p>To assist interested persons dealing with it, each agency shall adopt as a rule a description of its organization, stating the general course and method of its operations and the methods whereby the public may obtain information and make submissions or requests.

<li>
<p>No agency order, decision, or opinion is valid or effective against any person, nor may it be invoked by the agency for any purpose, unless it is available for public inspection. This subsection is not applicable in favor of any person who has actual knowledge of the order, decision, or opinion.

</li>
<li>
<p>Each agency that is authorized by law to exercise discretion in deciding individual cases is encouraged to formalize the general principles that may evolve from these decisions by adopting the principles as rules that the agency will follow until they are amended or repealed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent practicable, any rule proposed or adopted by an agency should be clearly and simply stated, so that it can be understood by those required to comply.</p>

<li>
<p>The departments of employment security, labor and industries, ecology, and revenue shall develop and use a notification process to communicate information to the public regarding the postadoption notice required by RCW 34.05.362.</p>

<ol type="a">

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enter an order declaring the applicability of the statute, rule, or order in question to the specified circumstances;</p>

<p>Before adopting a rule described in subsection (5) of this section, an agency must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Clearly state in detail the general goals and specific objectives of the statute that the rule implements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine that the rule is needed to achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection, and analyze alternatives to rule making and the consequences of not adopting the rule;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide notification in the notice of proposed rule making under RCW 34.05.320 that a preliminary cost-benefit analysis is available. The preliminary cost-benefit analysis must fulfill the requirements of the cost-benefit analysis under (d) of this subsection. If the agency files a supplemental notice under RCW 34.05.340, the supplemental notice must include notification that a revised preliminary cost-benefit analysis is available. A final cost-benefit analysis must be available when the rule is adopted under RCW 34.05.360;</p>

<li>
<p>Determine that the probable benefits of the rule are greater than its probable costs, taking into account both the qualitative and quantitative benefits and costs and the specific directives of the statute being implemented;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine, after considering alternative versions of the rule and the analysis required under (b), (c), and (d) of this subsection, that the rule being adopted is the least burdensome alternative for those required to comply with it that will achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine that the rule does not require those to whom it applies to take an action that violates requirements of another federal or state law;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Determine if the rule differs from any federal regulation or statute applicable to the same activity or subject matter and, if so, determine that the difference is justified by the following:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A state statute that explicitly allows the agency to differ from federal standards; or</p>
<ol type="i" start="2">
<li>
<p>Substantial evidence that the difference is necessary to achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection; and</p>

<li>
<p>After adopting a rule described in subsection (5) of this section regulating the same activity or subject matter as another provision of federal or state law, an agency must do all of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Coordinate implementation and enforcement of the rule with the other federal and state entities regulating the same activity or subject matter by making every effort to do one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Deferring to the other entity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designating a lead agency; or</p>
</li>

<p>Unless it complies with subsection (3) of this section, an agency may not adopt a rule that is substantially different from the rule proposed in the published notice of proposed rule adoption or a supplemental notice in the proceeding. If an agency contemplates making a substantial variance from a proposed rule described in a published notice, it may file a supplemental notice with the code reviser meeting the requirements of RCW 34.05.320 and reopen the proceedings for public comment on the proposed variance, or the agency may withdraw the proposed rule and commence a new rule-making proceeding to adopt a substantially different rule. If a new rule-making proceeding is commenced, relevant public comment received regarding the initial proposed rule shall be considered in the new proceeding.</p>

<p>If the agency, without filing a supplemental notice under subsection (1) of this section, adopts a rule that varies in content from the proposed rule, the general subject matter of the adopted rule must remain the same as the proposed rule. The agency shall briefly describe any changes, other than editing changes, and the principal reasons for adopting the changes. The brief description shall be filed with the code reviser together with the order of adoption for publication in the state register. Within sixty days of publication of the adopted rule in the state register, any interested person may petition the agency to amend any portion of the adopted rule that is substantially different from the proposed rule. The petition shall briefly demonstrate how the adopted rule is substantially different from the proposed rule and shall contain the text of the petitioner's proposed amendment. For purposes of the petition, an adopted rule is substantially different if the issues determined in the adopted rule differ from the issues determined in the proposed rule or the anticipated effects of the adopted rule differ from those of the proposed rule. If the petition meets the requirements of this subsection and RCW 34.05.330, the agency shall initiate rule-making proceedings upon the proposed amendments within the time provided in RCW 34.05.330.</p>

<p>If an agency for good cause finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That state or federal law or federal rule or a federal deadline for state receipt of federal funds requires immediate adoption of a rule; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to implement the requirements or reductions in appropriations enacted in any budget for fiscal year 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, or in an omnibus transportation appropriations act for the 2021-2023 biennium related to setting toll rates or ferry fares, which necessitates the need for the immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the fiscal needs or requirements of the agency,</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>the agency may dispense with those requirements and adopt, amend, or repeal the rule on an emergency basis. The agency's finding and a concise statement of the reasons for its finding shall be incorporated in the order for adoption of the emergency rule or amendment filed with the office of the code reviser under RCW 34.05.380 and with the rules review committee.</p>

<p>An emergency rule adopted under this section takes effect upon filing with the code reviser, unless a later date is specified in the order of adoption, and may not remain in effect for longer than one hundred twenty days after filing. Identical or substantially similar emergency rules may not be adopted in sequence unless conditions have changed or the agency has filed notice of its intent to adopt the rule as a permanent rule, and is actively undertaking the appropriate procedures to adopt the rule as a permanent rule. This section does not relieve any agency from compliance with any law requiring that its permanent rules be approved by designated persons or bodies before they become effective.</p>

<li>
<p>Within seven days after the rule is adopted, any person may petition the governor requesting the immediate repeal of a rule adopted on an emergency basis by any department listed in RCW 43.17.010. Within seven days after submission of the petition, the governor shall either deny the petition in writing, stating his or her reasons for the denial, or order the immediate repeal of the rule. In ruling on the petition, the governor shall consider only whether the conditions in subsection (1) of this section were met such that adoption of the rule on an emergency basis was necessary. If the governor orders the repeal of the emergency rule, any sanction imposed based on that rule is void. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit adoption of any rule as a permanent rule.</p>

<p>An agency may file notice for the expedited adoption of rules in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section for rules meeting any one of the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The proposed rules relate only to internal governmental operations that are not subject to violation by a person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rules adopt or incorporate by reference without material change federal statutes or regulations, Washington state statutes, rules of other Washington state agencies, shoreline master programs other than those programs governing shorelines of statewide significance, or, as referenced by Washington state law, national consensus codes that generally establish industry standards, if the material adopted or incorporated regulates the same subject matter and conduct as the adopting or incorporating rule;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rules only correct typographical errors, make address or name changes, or clarify language of a rule without changing its effect;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The content of the proposed rules is explicitly and specifically dictated by statute;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rules have been the subject of negotiated rule making, pilot rule making, or some other process that involved substantial participation by interested parties before the development of the proposed rule; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed rule is being amended after a review under RCW 34.05.328.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agency may file notice for the expedited repeal of rules under the procedures set forth in this section for rules meeting any one of the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The statute on which the rule is based has been repealed and has not been replaced by another statute providing statutory authority for the rule;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statute on which the rule is based has been declared unconstitutional by a court with jurisdiction, there is a final judgment, and no statute has been enacted to replace the unconstitutional statute;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rule is no longer necessary because of changed circumstances; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other rules of the agency or of another agency govern the same activity as the rule, making the rule redundant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expedited rule-making process must follow the requirements for rule making set forth in RCW 34.05.320, except that the agency is not required to prepare a small business economic impact statement under RCW 19.85.025, a statement indicating whether the rule constitutes a significant legislative rule under RCW 34.05.328(5)(c)(iii), or a significant legislative rule analysis under RCW 34.05.328. An agency is not required to prepare statements of inquiry under RCW 34.05.310 or conduct a hearing for the expedited rule making. The notice for the expedited rule making must contain a statement in at least ten-point type, that is substantially in the following form:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTICE</p>
<p>THIS RULE IS BEING PROPOSED UNDER AN EXPEDITED RULE-MAKING PROCESS THAT WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THE AGENCY TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS, PREPARE A SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT, OR PROVIDE RESPONSES TO THE CRITERIA FOR A SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE RULE. IF YOU OBJECT TO THIS USE OF THE EXPEDITED RULE-MAKING PROCESS, YOU MUST EXPRESS YOUR OBJECTIONS IN WRITING AND THEY MUST BE SENT TO (INSERT NAME AND ADDRESS) AND RECEIVED BY (INSERT DATE).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>The agency shall send either a copy of the notice of the proposed expedited rule making, or a summary of the information on the notice, to any person who has requested notification of proposals for expedited rule making or of regular agency rule making, as well as the joint administrative rules review committee, within three days after its publication in the Washington State Register. An agency may charge for the actual cost of providing a requesting party mailed copies of these notices. The notice of the proposed expedited rule making must be preceded by a statement substantially in the form provided in subsection (3) of this section. The notice must also include an explanation of the reasons the agency believes the expedited rule-making process is appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code reviser shall publish the text of all rules proposed for expedited adoption, and the citation and caption of all rules proposed for expedited repeal, along with the notice required in this section in a separate section of the Washington State Register. Once the notice of expedited rule making has been published in the Washington State Register, the only changes that an agency may make in the noticed materials before their final adoption or repeal are to correct typographical errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person may file a written objection to the expedited rule making. The objection must be filed with the agency rules coordinator within forty-five days after the notice of the proposed expedited rule making has been published in the Washington State Register. A person who has filed a written objection to the expedited rule making may withdraw the objection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no written objections to the expedited rule making are filed with the agency within forty-five days after the notice of proposed expedited rule making is published, or if all objections that have been filed are withdrawn by the persons filing the objections, the agency may enter an order adopting or repealing the rule without further notice or a public hearing. The order must be published in the manner required by this chapter for any other agency order adopting, amending, or repealing a rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a written notice of objection to the expedited rule making is timely filed with the agency and is not withdrawn, the notice of proposed expedited rule making published under this section is considered a statement of inquiry for the purposes of RCW 34.05.310, and the agency may initiate further rule-making proceedings in accordance with this chapter.</p>

The presiding officer may condition use of discovery on a showing of necessity and unavailability by other means. In exercising such discretion, the presiding officer shall consider: (a) Whether all parties are represented by counsel; (b) whether undue expense or delay in bringing the case to hearing will result; (c) whether the discovery will promote the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceeding; and (d) whether the interests of justice will be promoted.</p>

<li>
<p>The presiding officer shall cause the hearing to be recorded by a method chosen by the agency. The agency is not required, at its expense, to prepare a transcript, unless required to do so by a provision of law. Any party, at the party's expense, may cause a reporter approved by the agency to prepare a transcript from the agency's record, or cause additional recordings to be made during the hearing if the making of the additional recording does not cause distraction or disruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hearing is open to public observation, except for the parts that the presiding officer states to be closed under a provision of law expressly authorizing closure or under a protective order entered by the presiding officer pursuant to applicable rules. A presiding officer may order the exclusion of witnesses upon a showing of good cause. To the extent that the hearing is conducted by telephone, television, or other electronic means, and is not closed, the availability of public observation is satisfied by giving members of the public an opportunity, at reasonable times, to hear or inspect the agency's record, and to inspect any transcript obtained by the agency.</p>

<li>
<p>Service of the petition on the agency shall be by delivery of a copy of the petition to the office of the director, or other chief administrative officer or chairperson of the agency, at the principal office of the agency.

<p>If a person fails to obey an agency subpoena issued in an adjudicative proceeding, or obeys the subpoena but refuses to testify or produce documents when requested concerning a matter under examination, the agency or attorney issuing the subpoena may petition the superior court of any county where the hearing is being conducted, where the subpoenaed person resides or is found, or where subpoenaed documents are located, for enforcement of the subpoena. The petition shall be accompanied by a copy of the subpoena and proof of service, shall set forth in what specific manner the subpoena has not been complied with, and shall request an order of the court to compel compliance. Upon such petition, the court shall enter an order directing the person to appear before the court at a time and place fixed in the order to show cause why the person has not obeyed the subpoena or has refused to testify or produce documents. A copy of the court's show cause order shall be served upon the person. If it appears to the court that the subpoena was properly issued, and that the particular questions the person refused to answer or the requests for production of documents were reasonable and relevant, the court shall enter an order that the person appear before the agency at the time and place fixed in the order and testify or produce the required documents, and on failing to obey this order the person shall be dealt with as for contempt of court.</p>
