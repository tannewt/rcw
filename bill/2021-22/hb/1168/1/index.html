<ol>
<li>
<p>Over the last decade, wildfires have grown larger and increased in intensity and destructiveness throughout Washington state. The annual acres burned in our state illustrates this alarming trend. In the 1990s, an average of 86,000 acres burned annually. In the 2000s, the average annual acres burned increased to 189,000. In the last five years, the annual average grew to more than 488,000 acres burned. This trajectory of escalation continued last year, with wildfires burning more than 812,000 acres. Recent wildfires have devastated state, federal, tribal, and private lands, destroyed homes and property, and taken lives. These fires have also released greenhouse gases, destroyed critical fish and wildlife habitat, filled our skies with toxic smoke, polluted our waters, damaged our economy, increased the risk of flooding and landslides, created a critical need for reforestation, and threatened the natural resources needed for essential industries and rural economies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catastrophic wildfires have significant negative impacts on fish and wildlife habitat, including the loss and degradation of places to shelter and feed, water quality and quantity, and soil nutrients. Washington's fish and wildlife are part of a fire-adapted landscape, but catastrophic wildfires threaten their health and recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wildfires result in significant greenhouse gas emissions. Wildfires have become one of the largest sources of black carbon in the last five years. From 2014-2018, wildfires in Washington state generated 39.2 million metric tons of carbon, the equivalent of more than 8.5 million cars on the road a year. In 2015, when 1.13 million acres burned in Washington, wildfires were the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, second only to transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature has recognized our forests, as well as the manufacturing and utilization of wood products, as a natural carbon solution and critical component of our state's carbon reduction strategy pursuant to chapter 120, Laws of 2020. Wildfires threaten the ability of our forests to sequester carbon, and they threaten the stability and long-term viability of our forest products industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington state department of natural resources' 20-year forest health strategic plan and climate risk assessment finds that carbon emissions from wildfires are anticipated to increase if there is no change in forest management practices. Unless the state significantly increases active forest management across land ownerships to reduce the risk and intensity of wildfires, wildfire emissions will erode efforts to achieve our state's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wildfires inflict huge costs to the state budget, the budgets of partner agencies, and our economy. From 2014-2019, agencies in Washington annually spent nearly $150 million fighting wildfires. In 2015, firefighting costs were more than $342 million. In 2019, firefighting costs were more than $172 million. And suppression costs are only a small portion of the full economic impact. According to a 2018 report by the nonprofit headwater's economics, suppression costs account for only nine percent of the total cost of wildfires when factoring in disaster recovery, lost business, lost infrastructure, and timber damage, and public health impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over one-half of Washington is forested, providing significant environmental and economic value. Over $4,900,000,000 in wages and $200,000,000 in taxes are paid by the forest products' sector each year. Opportunities exist to boost our rural economies through wildfire preparation and preparedness that maintain and attract private sector investments and employment in rural communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wildfires are significant threats to life and property. Over the last five years, wildfires in Washington have taken five lives, including four firefighters and the life of a one-year old boy. In 2020 alone, 298 homes were destroyed by wildfires in our state. More than 1,100 homes have been destroyed this decade. Communities in every corner of Washington have felt the impact and devastation of flames and smoke. In 2020, the town of Malden, Washington was forever scarred by wildfire. Approximately 80 percent of the town's structures burned down in the Babb Road fire, including the city hall, post office, and fire station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wildfire smoke has significant negative impacts on public health. For the second time in the last three years, Washington state had the worst air quality in the world due to wildfires. Communities in every corner of the state felt the impact. Exposure to particulate matter in wildfire smoke has been associated with a wide range of damaging health effects. The particulates in this smoke make those breathing the air wheeze, cough, shorten their breath, and experience sore eyes and throats, diminishing health and quality of life. Other adverse health outcomes are more severe, including increases in asthma-related hospitalizations, chronic and acute respiratory and cardiovascular health problems, and premature death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inadequate levels of forest management and a rapidly changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic wildfires throughout the state. It is the policy of the state to encourage prudent and responsible forest resource management to maintain the health of forests and ecosystems in Washington state. Increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration through fuel reduction, thinning, and the use of prescribed fire on federal, state, tribal, and private lands pursuant to the 20-year forest health strategic plan and RCW 79.10.520 will reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, more than 1,300,000 acres of national forest system land in eastern Washington were considered in need of treatments to restore forest health and reduce the risk of wildfire hazard potential. Many of these lands are adjacent to populated communities, private lands, and state trust lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, 166,000 acres of department of natural resources' land and 74,000 acres of other state-owned lands in eastern Washington were in need of forest health treatment. These forestlands provide critical fish and wildlife habitat, natural and cultural resources, recreation, raw materials for the forest industry, and funding for counties and schools. From 2011-2020, 102,700 forested acres of department of natural resources' managed trust lands have burned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tribal lands and communities have been significantly impacted by wildfires and unhealthy forests. Approximately 494,000 acres of tribal lands in eastern Washington need forest health treatments. These forestlands provide critical fish and wildlife habitat, natural and cultural resources, and economic opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state has nearly eight million acres of private forestlands. In eastern Washington alone, approximately 288,000 acres owned by small forestland owners are in need of forest health treatment. These forestlands provide critical raw materials for the forest industry, rural economic opportunities, fish and wildlife habitat, cultural resources, and recreation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that increasing the pace and scale of science-based forest health activities to reduce hazardous fuels, including through mechanical thinning and controlled burning, on federal, state, tribal, and private lands, will reduce the risk and severity of wildfires, protect cultural and archaeological resources, improve fish and wildlife habitat, expand recreational opportunities, protect air and water quality, create rural economic opportunities, provide critical wood products, and increase long-term carbon sequestration on our natural resource lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased development in the wildland urban interface has also increased the number of people living in areas that are at risk of wildfire. In Washington, over 2,000,000 homes are currently at risk of wildfire. Communities and homeowners can take actions that reduce the risk of loss in the event of wildfire including, but not limited to, home hardening, creating defensible space, and building potential control lines or strategic fuel breaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term, sustainable investment in wildfire response, forest restoration, and community resilience is of utmost importance to the health and safety of our environment, our economy, our communities, and the well-being of every resident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to take immediate action to fully fund the wildland fire protection 10-year strategic plan. Strategies to accomplish these goals include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Upgrading our capability to attack wildfires with critical air and ground resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing needed wildfire resources to state wildfire response and local fire service districts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with each state utility, local publicly owned electric utility, and electrical cooperative to reduce wildfire risk and develop consistent approaches and shared data related to fire prevention, safety, vegetation management, and energy distribution systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving wildfire detection in areas at risk of wildfire through new technologies and equipment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature to take immediate action to increase the pace and scale of forest management across different land ownerships and fully fund the 20-year forest health strategic plan and activities developed to facilitate implementation of the 2020 forest action plan. Strategies to accomplish these goals include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Restoring to health a minimum of 1,250,000 acres of forestland in need of immediate action to become more resilient;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completing prescribed fire and other fuel reduction projects through proven forestry practices and the operation of prescribed fire crews;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing potential control lines and strategic fuel breaks around communities with high wildfire risk; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring forest health conditions and effectiveness of treatments throughout the state, including ecological function and reducing catastrophic wildfires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature to take immediate action to help communities become more resilient to wildfire. Strategies to accomplish these goals include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Increasing funding for cost share programs for home hardening, fuels reduction, and community resilience programs in communities at risk of wildfire;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing wildfire risk to wildland urban interfaces; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring our state's most vulnerable populations are not disproportionately burdened by the impact and consequences of wildfire.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that these investments protect the state's people, environment, and economy.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department must establish a forest health assessment and treatment framework designed to proactively and systematically address the forest health issues facing the state. Specifically, the framework must endeavor to achieve an initial goal of assessing and treating one million acres of land by 2033.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must utilize the framework to assess and treat acreage in an incremental fashion each biennium. The framework consists of three elements: Assessment; treatment; and progress review and reporting.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Assessment. Each biennium, the department must identify and assess two hundred thousand acres of fire prone lands and communities that are in need of forest health treatment, including the use of prescribed fire or mechanical treatment.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The scope of the assessment must include lands protected by the department as well as lands outside of the department's fire protection responsibilities that could pose a high risk to department protected lands during a fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assessment must identify areas in need of treatment, the type or types of treatment recommended, <strong>spatial optimization of forest treatments across landscapes,</strong> data and planning needs to carry out recommended treatment, and the estimated cost of recommended treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The department shall develop a mapping tool to identify small forestland owners within wildfire risk areas and use this tool to evaluate and optimize forest health work at a landscape scale to move high risk wildfire areas to lower risk and to leverage funding and the small forestland owner program and landowner assistance program in (e) of this subsection with the greatest impact for wildfire prevention, preparedness, and response.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment. Each biennium, the department must review previously completed assessments and prioritize and conduct as many identified treatments as possible using appropriations provided for that specific purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Progress review and reporting. By December 1st of each even-numbered year, the department must provide the appropriate committees of the legislature and the office of financial management with:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A request for appropriations designed to implement the framework in the following biennium, including assessment work and conducting treatments identified in previously completed assessments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A prioritized list and brief summary of treatments planned to be conducted under the framework with the requested appropriations, including relevant information from the assessment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list and brief summary of treatments carried out under the framework in the preceding biennium, including total funding available, costs for completed treatment, and treatment outcomes. The summary must include any barriers to framework implementation and legislative or administrative recommendations to address those barriers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing and implementing the framework, the department must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Utilize and build on the forest health strategic planning initiated under section 308(11), chapter 36, Laws of 2016 sp. sess., to the maximum extent practicable, to promote the efficient use of resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with this section, forest health treatments that are strategically planned to serve the dual benefits of forest health maximization while providing geographically planned tools for wildfire response;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where possible, partner with federally recognized tribes to expand use of the tribal forest protection act on federal lands managed by the United States forest service and the bureau of land management;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When entering into good neighbor agreements, as that term is defined in RCW 79.02.010, prioritize, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with this section, forest health treatments adjacent to or nearby state lands so as to increase the speed, efficiency, and impact on the landscape;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work with local fire districts, conservation districts, forestland owner associations, community wildfire resilience coalitions, and Washington State University extension to develop an integrated small forestland owner assistance program for forest health activities that:</strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>Integrate existing and diversify landowner assistance programs to more efficiently and effectively reach the diversity of small forestland owners audiences to take action;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifies and removes barriers to technical assistance, funding, and forest health management planning;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increases education and outreach to small forestland owners; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distributes funding effectively to move high wildfire risk areas to lower risk; and</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a forest health advisory committee to assist in developing and implementing the framework. The committee may: (i) Include representation from large and small forestland owners, wildland fire response organizations, milling and log transportation industries, forest collaboratives that may exist in the affected areas, highly affected communities and community preparedness organizations, conservation groups, and other interested parties deemed appropriate by the commissioner; and (ii) consult with relevant local, state, and federal agencies, and tribes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In implementing subsection (3)(b) of this section, the department shall attempt to locate and design forest health treatments in such a way as to provide wildfire response personnel with strategically located treated areas to assist with managing fire response. These areas must attempt to maximize the firefighting benefits of natural and artificial geographic features and be located in areas that prioritize the protection of commercially managed lands from fires originating on public land.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must establish and implement the forest health assessment and treatment framework within the appropriations specifically provided for this purpose.</p>

<h2 id="section-5-1160">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-1160">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that satisfying the goals identified in section 1 of this act to increase the pace and scale of forest health treatments and improve wildfire prevention and response requires increasing the workforce that is needed to perform this critical work. This need creates an opportunity to develop employment and career pathways across the state, including in rural communities throughout Washington. Investments to support and further develop the forest sector workforce are recommended in both the department's 2019 &quot;plan for climate resilience&quot; and the department of commerce's 2020 report &quot;Washington's green economy.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department and the department of commerce shall jointly develop and implement, as appropriate and in consultation with centers of excellence, higher education, and workforce development centers, initiatives to develop a forest health workforce necessary to implement the goals of this section. Initiatives may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Creating a new or making an existing grant program available to nonprofits, labor organizations, state agencies, community and technical colleges, institutions of higher education, private sector employers, skills centers, or other training and education institutions that have qualifications and experience in the development of training programs, such as secondary and postsecondary courses, relevant to the workforce needs of the forest sector. Grants must be awarded on a competitive basis with priority funding for programs that meet urgent forest health and wildfire suppression skills gaps and demonstrate a lack of available workforce in underserved communities. Grants awarded may be used for activities such as internships, Washington registered apprenticeship programs, preapprenticeships, career launch, and other relevant career connect Washington activities, and postsecondary bridge programs for forest sector or skill relevant trades that provide:</p>
<ol type="i">
