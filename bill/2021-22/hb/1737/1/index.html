<li>
<p>When using physical force, use <strong>a proportional</strong> amount of physical force necessary to overcome resistance under the circumstances. This includes a consideration of the characteristics and conditions of a person for the purposes of determining whether to use force against that person and, if force is necessary, determining the appropriate and least amount of force <strong>reasonable</strong> to effect a lawful purpose. Such characteristics and conditions may include, for example, whether the person: Is visibly pregnant, or states that they are pregnant; is known to be a minor, objectively appears to be a minor, or states that they are a minor; is known to be a vulnerable adult, or objectively appears to be a vulnerable adult as defined in RCW 74.34.020; displays signs of mental, behavioral, or physical impairments or disabilities; is experiencing perceptual or cognitive impairments typically related to the use of alcohol, narcotics, hallucinogens, or other drugs; is suicidal; has limited English proficiency; or is in the presence of children;</p>

<li>
<p>Terminate the use of physical force as soon as the necessity for such force ends; <strong>and</strong></p>

<li>
<p>To help prevent misconduct, enhance peace officer and corrections officer accountability through the imposition of sanctions commensurate to the wrongdoing when misconduct occurs, and enhance public trust and confidence in the criminal justice system, upon request by an officer's employer or on its own initiative, the commission may deny, suspend, or revoke certification of, or require remedial training for, an officer as provided in this section.

Notice and hearing are not required when a peace officer voluntarily surrenders certification.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the penalties set forth in subsection (3) of this section, the commission may require mandatory retraining or placement on probation for up to two years, or both. In determining the appropriate penalty or sanction, the commission shall consider: The findings and conclusions, and the basis for the findings and conclusions, of any due process hearing or disciplinary appeals hearing following an investigation by a law enforcement agency regarding the alleged misconduct, if such hearing has occurred prior to the commission's action; any sanctions or training ordered by the employing agency regarding the alleged misconduct; and whether the employing agency bears any responsibility for the situation.</p>

<p>Any suspension or period of probation imposed by the commission shall run concurrently to any leave or discipline imposed by the employing agency for the same incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A law enforcement agency may not terminate a peace officer based solely on imposition of suspension or probation <strong>for a period of 90 days or less</strong> by the commission. This subsection does not prohibit a law enforcement agency from terminating a peace officer based on the underlying acts or omissions for which the commission took such action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any of the misconduct listed in subsections (2) and (3) of this section is grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation of certification of a reserve officer to the same extent as applied to a peace officer, if the reserve officer is certified pursuant to RCW 43.101.095.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the commission must not deny, revoke, or suspend certification if the commission finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the conduct that would otherwise subject the officer to denial, revocation, or suspension was made in good faith and in the interests of public safety.</strong></p>
