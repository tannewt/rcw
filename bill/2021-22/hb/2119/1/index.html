<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a portion of the state's greenhouse gas emissions are directly related to petroleum fuel products produced by the state's five refineries that are exported to other states and jurisdictions. These carbon emissions have a real impact on the citizens of the state of Washington and these impacts are not adequately compensated for under the existing taxing structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that carbon emissions directly attributable to just the refining process associated with petroleum fuel products that are subsequently exported has been estimated at 3,300,000 metric tons per year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the costs associated with carbon emissions are global in nature and the impacts associated with carbon emissions are not simply felt by those within a state's geographic boundary. However, applying a standard societal costs of carbon method results in estimated annual impacts over $250,000,000 associated with the current amount of exported petroleum fuel products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to modify state fuel tax law in a manner that compensates the state for a portion of the societal costs of carbon attributable to the refining process associated with petroleum fuel products that are subsequently exported, but also ensures that the current favorable tax treatment for petroleum fuel products that are exported continues.</p>

<li>
<p>In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed for fuel exported from the state. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the credit is equal to the number of gallons of fuel exported multiplied by the total rate of tax imposed under this chapter, less six cents per gallon. Fuel distributed to a federally recognized Indian tribal reservation located within the state of Washington is not considered exported from this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the total rate of a comparable fuel tax imposed by the importing state exceeds the total rate of tax imposed under this chapter less six cents per gallon, the credit is equal to the number of gallons of fuel exported multiplied by the total rate of tax imposed by the importing state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of credit earned under this section may not exceed the tax otherwise due under this chapter with respect to the fuel exported.</p>

For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;research&quot; means a planned and systematic sociological, psychological, epidemiological, biomedical, or other scientific investigation carried out by a state agency, or by a scientific research professional associated with a bona fide scientific research organization with an objective to contribute to scientific knowledge, the solution of social and health problems, or the evaluation of public benefit and service programs. This definition excludes methods of record analysis and data collection that are subjective, do not permit replication, and are not designed to yield reliable and valid results.

    ii. The state agency, or a scientific research professional associated with a bona fide scientific research organization, are exempt from paying the fees related to the reviewing of records and the fee required in subsection (5) of this section. However, the department may charge a cost-recovery fee for the actual cost of providing the data.

<p>The legislative authority of a border area jurisdiction may, by resolution for the purposes authorized in this chapter and by approval of a majority of the registered voters of the jurisdiction voting on the proposition at a general or special election, fix and impose an excise tax on the retail sale of motor vehicle fuel and special fuel within the jurisdiction. An election held under this section must be held not more than <strong>12</strong> months before the date on which the proposed tax is to be levied. The ballot setting forth the proposition <strong>must</strong> state the tax rate that is proposed. The rate of such tax <strong>may</strong> not exceed <strong>two cents</strong> per gallon <strong>for ballot propositions submitted in calendar year 2022. For ballot propositions submitted after calendar year 2022, this two cents per gallon maximum tax rate may be adjusted to reflect the percentage change in the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures for the United States as published by the bureau of economic analysis of the federal department of commerce, for the period of time between calendar year 2022 and when the tax is placed on the ballot for voter approval</strong>.</p>

<li>
<p>Include provisions to address the efficiency of a fuel as used in a powertrain as compared to a reference fuel;</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Neutrally consider the life-cycle emissions associated with transportation fuels with respect to the political jurisdiction in which the fuels originated and may not discriminate against fuels on the basis of having originated in another state or jurisdiction. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to prohibit inclusion or assessment of emissions related to fuel production, storage, transportation, or combustion or associated changes in land use in determining the carbon intensity of a fuel;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity and hydrogen based on a mix of generation resources specific to each electric utility participating in the clean fuels program. The department may apply an asset-controlling supplier emission factor certified or approved by a similar program to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels in another state;</p>

<pre><code>    iv. Allow the generation of credits associated with electricity with a carbon intensity lower than that of standard adopted by the department. The department may not require electricity to have a carbon intensity of zero in order to be eligible to generate credits from use as a transportation fuel; and

v. Include procedures for setting and adjusting the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of fuel energy that is assigned to transportation fuels under this subsection.

c. If the department determines that it is necessary for purposes of accurately measuring greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels, the department may require transportation fuel suppliers to submit data or information to be used for purposes of calculating greenhouse gas emissions that is different from or additional to the greenhouse gas emissions data reported under RCW 70A.15.2200(5)(a)(iii).

d. If the department determines that it is necessary for purposes of accurately measuring greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity supplied to retail customers or hydrogen production facilities by an electric utility, the department may require electric utilities participating in the clean fuels program to submit data or information to be used for purposes of calculating greenhouse gas emissions that is different from or additional to the fuel mix disclosure information submitted under chapter 19.29A RCW.

For 2024 and subsequent years, the maximum price may exceed $200 in 2018 dollars, but only to the extent that a greater maximum price for credits is necessary to annually adjust for inflation, beginning on January 1, 2024, pursuant to the increase, if any, from the preceding calendar year in the consumer price index for all urban consumers, west region (all items), as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor.

d. A regulated party that has a net deficit balance after the close of a credit clearance market:

    i. Must carry over the remaining deficits into the next compliance period; and

    ii. May not be subject to interest greater than five percent, penalties, or assertions of noncompliance that accrue based on the carryover of deficits under this subsection.

e. If a regulated party has been required under (a) of this subsection to participate as a purchaser in two consecutive credit clearance markets and continues to have a net deficit balance after the close of the second consecutive credit clearance market, the department shall complete, no later than two months after the close of the second credit clearance market, an analysis of the root cause of an inability of the regulated party to retire the remaining deficits. The department may recommend and implement any remedy that the department determines is necessary to address the root cause identified in the analysis including, but not limited to, issuing a deferral, provided that the remedy implemented does not:

    i. Require a regulated party to purchase credits for an amount that exceeds the maximum price for credits in the most recent credit clearance market; or

    ii. Compel a person to sell credits.

f. If credits sold in a credit clearance market are subsequently invalidated as a result of fraud or any other form of noncompliance on the part of the generator of the credit, the department may not pursue civil penalties against, or require credit replacement by, the regulated party that purchased the credits unless the regulated party was a party to the fraud or other form of noncompliance.

<p>In order to improve the safety, mobility, and accessibility of state highways, it is the intent of the legislature that the department must incorporate the principles of complete streets with facilities that provide street access with all users in mind, including pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation users, notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 47.24.020 concerning responsibility beyond the curb of state rights-of-way. As such, state transportation projects starting design on or after July 1, 2022, and that are $500,000 or more, must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identify those locations on state rights-of-way that do not have a complete and Americans with disabilities act accessible sidewalk or shared-use path, that do not have bicycle facilities in the form of a bike lane or adjacent parallel trail or shared-use path, that have such facilities on a state route within a population center that has a posted speed in excess of 30 miles per hour and no buffer or physical separation from vehicular traffic for pedestrians and bicyclists, and/or that have a design that hampers the ability of motorists to see a crossing pedestrian with sufficient time to stop given posted speed limits and roadway configuration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consult with local jurisdictions to confirm existing and planned active transportation connections along or across the location; identification of connections to existing and planned public transportation services, ferry landings, commuter and passenger rail, and airports; the existing and planned facility type(s) within the local jurisdiction that connect to the location; and the potential use of speed management techniques to minimize crash exposure and severity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjust the speed limit to a lower speed with appropriate modifications to roadway design and operations to achieve the desired operating speed in those locations where this speed management approach aligns with local plans or ordinances, particularly in those contexts that present a higher possibility of serious injury or fatal crashes occurring based on land use context, observed crash data, crash potential, roadway characteristics that are likely to increase exposure, or a combination thereof, in keeping with a safe system approach and with the intention of ultimately eliminating serious and fatal crashes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan, design, and construct facilities providing context-sensitive solutions that contribute to network connectivity and safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and people accessing public transportation and other modal connections, such facilities to include Americans with disabilities act accessible sidewalks or shared-use paths, bicyclist facilities, and crossings as needed to integrate the state route into the local network.</p>

<p>The use of automated traffic safety cameras for issuance of notices of infraction is subject to the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except for proposed locations used solely for the pilot program purposes permitted under subsection (6) of this section, the appropriate local legislative authority must prepare an analysis of the locations within the jurisdiction where automated traffic safety cameras are proposed to be located: (i) Before enacting an ordinance allowing for the initial use of automated traffic safety cameras; and (ii) before adding additional cameras or relocating any existing camera to a new location within the jurisdiction. Automated traffic safety cameras may be used to detect one or more of the following: Stoplight, railroad crossing,  school speed zone violations**, speed violations on any roadway identified in a school walk area as defined in RCW 28A.160.160, speed violations in public park speed zones, hospital speed zones,** speed violations subject to (c) <strong>or (d)</strong> of this subsection**,** or violations included in subsection (6) of this section for the duration of the pilot program authorized under subsection (6) of this section. At a minimum, the local ordinance must contain the restrictions described in this section and provisions for public notice and signage. Cities and counties using automated traffic safety cameras before July 24, 2005, are subject to the restrictions described in this section, but are not required to enact an authorizing ordinance. Beginning one year after June 7, 2012, cities and counties using automated traffic safety cameras must post an annual report of the number of traffic accidents that occurred at each location where an automated traffic safety camera is located as well as the number of notices of infraction issued for each camera and any other relevant information about the automated traffic safety cameras that the city or county deems appropriate on the city's or county's website.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For the purposes of this section:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) <strong>&quot;Public park speed zone&quot; means the marked area within public park property and extending 300 feet from the border of public park property (I) consistent with active park use; and (II) where signs are posted to indicate the location is within a public park speed zone.</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>&quot;Hospital speed zone&quot; means the marked area within hospital property and extending 300 feet from the border of hospital property (I) consistent with hospital use; and (II) where signs are posted to indicate the location is within a hospital speed zone, where &quot;hospital&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 70.41.020.</strong></p>
<pre><code>c. **In addition to the automated traffic safety cameras authorized under (d) of this subsection, any** city west of the Cascade mountains with a population of more than **195,000** located in a county with a population of fewer than **1,500,000** may operate an automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations subject to the following limitations:

    i. A city may only operate one such automated traffic safety camera within its respective jurisdiction; and

    ii. The use and location of the automated traffic safety camera must have first been authorized by the Washington state legislature as a pilot project for at least one full year.

d. [Empty]

    i. **Cities may operate at least one automated traffic safety camera under this subsection to detect speed violations, subject to the requirements of (d)(ii) of this subsection. Cities may operate one additional automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations for every 10,000 residents included in the city's population. Cameras must be placed in locations that comply with one of the following:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>The location has been identified as a priority location in a local road safety plan that a city has submitted to the Washington state department of transportation and where other speed reduction measures are not feasible or have not been sufficiently effective at reducing travel speed;</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>The location has a significantly higher rate of collisions than the city average in a period of at least three years prior to installation and other speed reduction measures are not feasible or have not been sufficiently effective at reducing travel speed; or</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>The location is in an area within the city limits designated by local ordinance as a zone subject to specified restrictions and penalties on racing and race attendance</strong>**.**</p>
<pre><code>    ii. **A city locating an automated traffic safety camera under this subsection (1)(d) must complete an equity analysis that evaluates livability, accessibility, economics, education, and environmental health, and shall consider the outcome of that analysis when identifying where to locate an automated traffic safety camera.**

e. **All locations where an automated traffic safety camera is used to detect speed violations on roadways identified in a school walk area, speed violations in public park speed zones, speed violations in hospital speed zones, or speed violations under (c) or (d) of this subsection must be clearly marked by placing signs in locations that clearly indicate to a driver either: (i) That the driver is within a school walk area, public park speed zone, or hospital speed zone; or (ii) that the driver is entering an area where speed violations are enforced by an automated traffic safety camera. Signs placed in automated traffic safety camera locations after June 7, 2012, must follow the specifications and guidelines under the manual of uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways as adopted by the department of transportation under chapter 47.36 RCW.**

f. Automated traffic safety cameras may only take pictures of the vehicle and vehicle license plate and only while an infraction is occurring. The picture must not reveal the face of the driver or of passengers in the vehicle. The primary purpose of camera placement is to take pictures of the vehicle and vehicle license plate when an infraction is occurring. Cities and counties shall consider installing cameras in a manner that minimizes the impact of camera flash on drivers.

g. A notice of infraction must be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within **14** days of the violation, or to the renter of a vehicle within **14** days of establishing the renter's name and address under subsection (3)(a) of this section. The law enforcement officer issuing the notice of infraction shall include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a violation under this chapter. The photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images evidencing the violation must be available for inspection and admission into evidence in a proceeding to adjudicate the liability for the infraction. A person receiving a notice of infraction based on evidence detected by an automated traffic safety camera may respond to the notice by mail.

h. The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible for an infraction under RCW 46.63.030(1)(d) unless the registered owner overcomes the presumption in RCW 46.63.075, or, in the case of a rental car business, satisfies the conditions under subsection (3) of this section. If appropriate under the circumstances, a renter identified under subsection (3)(a) of this section is responsible for an infraction.

i. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images, or any other personally identifying data prepared under this section are for the exclusive use of law enforcement in the discharge of duties under this section and are not open to the public and may not be used in a court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a violation under this section. No photograph, microphotograph, or electronic image, or any other personally identifying data may be used for any purpose other than enforcement of violations under this section nor retained longer than necessary to enforce this section.

j. All locations where an automated traffic safety camera is used must be clearly marked at least **30** days prior to activation of the camera by placing signs in locations that clearly indicate to a driver that he or she is entering a zone where traffic laws are enforced by an automated traffic safety camera. Signs placed in automated traffic safety camera locations after June 7, 2012, must follow the specifications and guidelines under the manual of uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways as adopted by the department of transportation under chapter 47.36 RCW.

k. If a county or city has established an authorized automated traffic safety camera program under this section, the compensation paid to the manufacturer or vendor of the equipment used must be based only upon the value of the equipment and services provided or rendered in support of the system, and may not be based upon a portion of the fine or civil penalty imposed or the revenue generated by the equipment.

l. **If a city is operating an automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations on roadways identified in a school walk area, speed violations in public park speed zones, speed violations in hospital speed zones, or speed violations under (c) or (d) of this subsection, the city shall remit monthly to the state 50 percent of the noninterest money received for infractions issued by those cameras excess of the cost to administer, install, operate, and maintain the automated traffic safety cameras, including the cost of processing infractions. Money remitted under this subsection to the state treasurer shall be deposited in the Cooper Jones active transportation safety account created in RCW 46.68.480. This subsection (1)(l) does not apply to automated traffic safety cameras authorized for stoplight, railroad crossing, or school speed zone violations.**

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The appropriate local legislative authority must prepare an analysis of the locations within the jurisdiction where automated traffic safety cameras are proposed to be located: (i) Before enacting an ordinance allowing for the initial use of automated traffic safety cameras; and (ii) before adding additional cameras or relocating any existing camera to a new location within the jurisdiction. Automated traffic safety cameras may be used to detect one or more of the following: Stoplight, railroad crossing,  school speed zone violations**, speed violations on any roadway identified in a school walk area as defined in RCW 28A.160.160, speed violations in public park speed zones, hospital speed zones,** or speed violations subject to (c) <strong>or (d)</strong> of this subsection. At a minimum, the local ordinance must contain the restrictions described in this section and provisions for public notice and signage. Cities and counties using automated traffic safety cameras before July 24, 2005, are subject to the restrictions described in this section, but are not required to enact an authorizing ordinance. Beginning one year after June 7, 2012, cities and counties using automated traffic safety cameras must post an annual report of the number of traffic accidents that occurred at each location where an automated traffic safety camera is located as well as the number of notices of infraction issued for each camera and any other relevant information about the automated traffic safety cameras that the city or county deems appropriate on the city's or county's website.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (c) <strong>and (d)</strong> of this subsection, use of automated traffic safety cameras is restricted to the following locations only: (A) Intersections of two arterials with traffic control signals that have yellow change interval durations in accordance with RCW 47.36.022, which interval durations may not be reduced after placement of the camera; (B) railroad crossings; (C) school speed zones**; (D) roadways identified in a school walk area as defined in RCW 28A.160.160; (E) public park speed zones, as defined in (b)(ii) of this subsection; and (F) hospital speed zones, as defined in (b)(ii) of this subsection**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For the purposes of this section:</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) <strong>&quot;Public park speed zone&quot; means the marked area within public park property and extending 300 feet from the border of public park property (I) consistent with active park use; and (II) where signs are posted to indicate the location is within a public park speed zone.</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>&quot;Hospital speed zone&quot; means the marked area within hospital property and extending 300 feet from the border of hospital property (I) consistent with hospital use; and (II) where signs are posted to indicate the location is within a hospital speed zone, where &quot;hospital&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 70.41.020.</strong></p>
<pre><code>c. **In addition to the automated traffic safety cameras authorized under (d) of this subsection, any** city west of the Cascade mountains with a population of more than **195,000** located in a county with a population of fewer than **1,500,000** may operate an automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations subject to the following limitations:

    i. A city may only operate one such automated traffic safety camera within its respective jurisdiction; and

    ii. The use and location of the automated traffic safety camera must have first been authorized by the Washington state legislature as a pilot project for at least one full year.

d. [Empty]

    i. **Cities may operate at least one automated traffic safety camera under this subsection to detect speed violations, subject to the requirements of (d)(ii) of this subsection. Cities may operate one additional automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations for every 10,000 residents included in the city's population. Cameras must be placed in locations that comply with one of the following:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>The location has been identified as a priority location in a local road safety plan that a city has submitted to the Washington state department of transportation and where other speed reduction measures are not feasible or have not been sufficiently effective at reducing travel speed;</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>The location has a significantly higher rate of collisions than the city average in a period of at least three years prior to installation and other speed reduction measures are not feasible or have not been sufficiently effective at reducing travel speed; or</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>The location is in an area within the city limits designated by local ordinance as a zone subject to specified restrictions and penalties on racing and race attendance</strong>**.**</p>
<pre><code>    ii. **A city locating an automated traffic safety camera under this subsection (1)(d) must complete an equity analysis that evaluates livability, accessibility, economics, education, and environmental health, and shall consider the outcome of that analysis when identifying where to locate an automated traffic safety camera.**

e. **All locations where an automated traffic safety camera is used to detect speed violations on roadways identified in a school walk area, speed violations in public park speed zones, speed violations in hospital speed zones, or speed violations under (c) or (d) of this subsection must be clearly marked by placing signs in locations that clearly indicate to a driver either: (i) That the driver is within a school walk area, public park speed zone, or hospital speed zone; or (ii) that the driver is entering an area where speed violations are enforced by an automated traffic safety camera. Signs placed in automated traffic safety camera locations after June 7, 2012, must follow the specifications and guidelines under the manual of uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways as adopted by the department of transportation under chapter 47.36 RCW.**

f. Automated traffic safety cameras may only take pictures of the vehicle and vehicle license plate and only while an infraction is occurring. The picture must not reveal the face of the driver or of passengers in the vehicle. The primary purpose of camera placement is to take pictures of the vehicle and vehicle license plate when an infraction is occurring. Cities and counties shall consider installing cameras in a manner that minimizes the impact of camera flash on drivers.

g. A notice of infraction must be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within **14** days of the violation, or to the renter of a vehicle within **14** days of establishing the renter's name and address under subsection (3)(a) of this section. The law enforcement officer issuing the notice of infraction shall include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a violation under this chapter. The photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images evidencing the violation must be available for inspection and admission into evidence in a proceeding to adjudicate the liability for the infraction. A person receiving a notice of infraction based on evidence detected by an automated traffic safety camera may respond to the notice by mail.

h. The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible for an infraction under RCW 46.63.030(1)(d) unless the registered owner overcomes the presumption in RCW 46.63.075, or, in the case of a rental car business, satisfies the conditions under subsection (3) of this section. If appropriate under the circumstances, a renter identified under subsection (3)(a) of this section is responsible for an infraction.

i. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images prepared under this section are for the exclusive use of law enforcement in the discharge of duties under this section and are not open to the public and may not be used in a court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a violation under this section. No photograph, microphotograph, or electronic image may be used for any purpose other than enforcement of violations under this section nor retained longer than necessary to enforce this section.

j. All locations where an automated traffic safety camera is used must be clearly marked at least **30** days prior to activation of the camera by placing signs in locations that clearly indicate to a driver that he or she is entering a zone where traffic laws are enforced by an automated traffic safety camera. Signs placed in automated traffic safety camera locations after June 7, 2012, must follow the specifications and guidelines under the manual of uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways as adopted by the department of transportation under chapter 47.36 RCW.

k. If a county or city has established an authorized automated traffic safety camera program under this section, the compensation paid to the manufacturer or vendor of the equipment used must be based only upon the value of the equipment and services provided or rendered in support of the system, and may not be based upon a portion of the fine or civil penalty imposed or the revenue generated by the equipment.

l. **If a city is operating an automated traffic safety camera to detect speed violations on roadways identified in a school walk area, speed violations in public park speed zones, speed violations in hospital speed zones, or speed violations under (c) or (d) of this subsection, the city shall remit monthly to the state 50 percent of the noninterest money received for infractions issued by those cameras excess of the cost to administer, install, operate, and maintain the automated traffic safety cameras, including the cost of processing infractions. Money remitted under this subsection to the state treasurer shall be deposited in the Cooper Jones active transportation safety account created in RCW 46.68.480. This subsection (1)(l) does not apply to automated traffic safety cameras authorized for stoplight, railroad crossing, or school speed zone violations.**

<li>
<p>If the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental car business, the law enforcement agency shall, before a notice of infraction being issued under this section, provide a written notice to the rental car business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business if the rental car business does not, within <strong>18</strong> days of receiving the written notice, provide to the issuing agency by return mail:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A statement under oath stating the name and known mailing address of the individual driving or renting the vehicle when the infraction occurred; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement under oath that the business is unable to determine who was driving or renting the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred because the vehicle was stolen at the time of the infraction. A statement provided under this subsection must be accompanied by a copy of a filed police report regarding the vehicle theft; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lieu of identifying the vehicle operator, the rental car business may pay the applicable penalty.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that in order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in RCW 70A.45.020 and 70A.45.050, the state must drastically reduce vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. A critical strategy to meet those goals is transitioning to zero emissions vehicles and this transition requires ongoing purposeful interagency coordination and cooperation. As such, it is the intent of the legislature to create a formal interagency council responsible for coordinating the state's transportation electrification efforts to ensure the state is leveraging state and federal resources to the best extent possible and to ensure zero emissions incentives, infrastructure, and opportunities are available and accessible to all Washingtonians.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that in order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in the transportation sector of the economy, more resources must be directed toward achieving zero emissions transportation and transit, while continuing to relieve energy burdens that exist in overburdened communities.</p>
