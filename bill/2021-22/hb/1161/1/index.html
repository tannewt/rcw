<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.48_drug_take-back_program.html">69.48.010</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.48_drug_take-back_program.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Abuse, fatal overdoses, and poisonings from prescription and over-the-counter medicines used in the home have emerged as an epidemic in recent years. Poisoning is the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in Washington, and more than ninety percent of poisoning deaths are due to drug overdoses. Poisoning by prescription and over-the-counter medicines is also one of the most common means of suicide and suicide attempts, with poisonings involved in more than twenty-eight thousand suicide attempts between 2004 and 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home medicine cabinets are the most common source of prescription drugs that are diverted and misused. Studies find about seventy percent of those who abuse prescription medicines obtain the drugs from family members or friends, usually for free. People who are addicted to heroin often first abused prescription opiate medicines. Unused, unwanted, and expired medicines that accumulate in homes increase risks of drug abuse, overdoses, and preventable poisonings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A safe system for the collection and disposal of unused, unwanted, and expired medicines is a key element of a comprehensive strategy to prevent prescription drug abuse, but disposing of medicines by flushing them down the toilet or placing them in the garbage can contaminate groundwater and other bodies of water, contributing to long-term harm to the environment and animal life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore finds that it is in the interest of public health to establish a single, uniform, statewide system of regulation for safe and secure collection and disposal of medicines through  drug &quot;take-back&quot; program<strong>s</strong> operated and funded by drug manufacturers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-1816">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1816">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that in 2018, the legislature passed Engrossed Substitute House Bill No. 1047, which required drug manufacturers that sell drugs into Washington to operate a drug take-back program to collect and dispose of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Further, the legislature finds that there is uncertainty about whether, under current law, more than one drug take-back program may operate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to clearly authorize the department of health to approve and allow the operation of multiple drug take-back programs that meet other statutory requirements.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong> program operator must submit a proposal for the establishment and implementation of a drug take-back program to the department for approval. The department shall approve a proposed program if the applicant submits a completed application, the proposed program meets the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, and the applicant pays the appropriate fee established by the department under RCW 69.48.120. <strong>The department may approve one or more program operators consistent with the provisions of this section.</strong></p>

<p>To be approved by the department, a proposed drug take-back program must:</p>
<ol type="a">

<li>
<p><strong>Ensure that physical collection sites are the primary method of collection and that methods of supplementing physical collection site service are the secondary methods for collection. Mail-back distribution locations should account for 25 percent or less of a program's collection sites.

<p>Provide for a handling and disposal system that complies with RCW 69.48.080;</p>
