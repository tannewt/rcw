<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish a community behavioral health system which shall help people experiencing mental illness or a substance use disorder to retain a respected and productive position in the community. This will be accomplished through programs that focus on resilience and recovery, and practices that are evidence-based, research-based, consensus-based, or, where these do not exist, promising or emerging best practices, which provide for:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Access to behavioral health services for adults with mental illness and children with mental illness, emotional disturbances, or substance use disorders, that recognize the special needs of underserved populations, including minorities, children, older adults, individuals with disabilities, and low-income persons. Access to mental health and substance use disorder services shall not be limited by a person's history of confinement in a state, federal, or local correctional facility. It is also the purpose of this chapter to promote the early identification of children with mental illness and to ensure that they receive the mental health care and treatment which is appropriate to their developmental level. This care should improve home, school, and community functioning, maintain children in a safe and nurturing home environment, and should enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs in accordance with sound professional judgment while also recognizing parents' rights to participate in treatment decisions for their children;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The involvement of persons with mental illness or substance use disorder, their family members, and advocates in designing and implementing behavioral health services that reduce unnecessary hospitalization and incarceration and promote recovery and employment. To improve the quality of services available and promote the rehabilitation, recovery, and reintegration of persons with mental illness or substance use disorder, consumer and advocate participation in behavioral health services is an integral part of the community behavioral health system and shall be supported;</p>

<p>It is the policy of the state to encourage the provision of a full range of treatment and rehabilitation services in the state for mental disorders, or substance use disorders, including services operated by consumers and advocates. The legislature intends to encourage the development of regional behavioral health services with adequate local flexibility to assure eligible people in need of care access to the least-restrictive treatment alternative appropriate to their needs, and the availability of treatment components to assure continuity of care. The legislature hereby finds and declares that sound fiscal management requires vigilance to ensure that funds appropriated by the legislature for the provision of needed community behavioral health system services are ultimately expended solely for the purpose for which they were appropriated, and not for any other purpose.</p>
<p>It is further the intent of the legislature to integrate the provision of services to provide continuity of care through all phases of treatment. To this end, the legislature intends to promote active engagement with persons with mental illness and collaboration between families and service providers.</p>

The secretary shall provide for deeming of licensed or certified behavioral health agencies as meeting state minimum standards as a result of accreditation by a recognized behavioral health accrediting body recognized and having a current agreement with the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall review reports or other information alleging a failure to comply with this chapter or the standards and rules adopted under this chapter and may initiate investigations and enforcement actions based on those reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall conduct inspections of agencies and facilities, including reviews of records and documents required to be maintained under this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may suspend, revoke, limit, restrict, or modify an approval, or refuse to grant approval, for failure to meet the provisions of this chapter, or the standards adopted under this chapter. RCW 43.70.115 governs notice of a license or certification denial, revocation, suspension, or modification and provides the right to an adjudicative proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No licensed or certified behavioral health service provider may advertise or represent itself as a licensed or certified behavioral health service provider if approval has not been granted or has been denied, suspended, revoked, or canceled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licensure or certification as a behavioral health service provider is effective for one calendar year from the date of issuance of the license or certification. The license or certification must specify the types of services provided by the behavioral health service provider that meet the standards adopted under this chapter. Renewal of a license or certification must be made in accordance with this section for initial approval and in accordance with the standards set forth in rules adopted by the secretary.</p>

Renewal of a license or certification must be made in accordance with this section for initial approval and in accordance with the standards set forth in rules adopted by the secretary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop a process by which a provider may obtain dual licensure as an evaluation and treatment facility and secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licensed or certified behavioral health service providers may not provide types of services for which the licensed or certified behavioral health service provider has not been certified. Licensed or certified behavioral health service providers may provide services for which approval has been sought and is pending, if approval for the services has not been previously revoked or denied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department periodically shall inspect licensed or certified behavioral health service providers at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon petition of the department and after a hearing held upon reasonable notice to the facility, the superior court may issue a warrant to an officer or employee of the department authorizing him or her to enter and inspect at reasonable times, and examine the books and accounts of, any licensed or certified behavioral health service provider refusing to consent to inspection or examination by the department or which the department has reasonable cause to believe is operating in violation of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall maintain and periodically publish a current list of licensed or certified behavioral health service providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each licensed or certified behavioral health service provider shall file with the department or the authority upon request, data, statistics, schedules, and information the department or the authority reasonably requires. A licensed or certified behavioral health service provider that without good cause fails to furnish any data, statistics, schedules, or information as requested, or files fraudulent returns thereof, may have its license or certification revoked or suspended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall use the data provided in subsection (14) of this section to evaluate each program that admits children to inpatient substance use disorder treatment upon application of their parents. The evaluation must be done at least once every twelve months. In addition, the authority shall randomly select and review the information on individual children who are admitted on application of the child's parent for the purpose of determining whether the child was appropriately placed into substance use disorder treatment based on an objective evaluation of the child's condition and the outcome of the child's treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any settlement agreement entered into between the department and licensed or certified behavioral health service providers to resolve administrative complaints, license or certification violations, license or certification suspensions, or license or certification revocations may not reduce the number of violations reported by the department unless the department concludes, based on evidence gathered by inspectors, that the licensed or certified behavioral health service provider did not commit one or more of the violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases in which a behavioral health service provider that is in violation of licensing or certification standards attempts to transfer or sell the behavioral health service provider to a family member, the transfer or sale may only be made for the purpose of remedying license or certification violations and achieving full compliance with the terms of the license or certification. Transfers or sales to family members are prohibited in cases in which the purpose of the transfer or sale is to avoid liability or reset the number of license or certification violations found before the transfer or sale. If the department finds that the owner intends to transfer or sell, or has completed the transfer or sale of, ownership of the behavioral health service provider to a family member solely for the purpose of resetting the number of violations found before the transfer or sale, the department may not renew the behavioral health service provider's license or certification or issue a new license or certification to the behavioral health service provider.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the current complex set of federal, state, and local rules and regulations, audited and administered at multiple levels, which affect the community mental health service delivery system, focus primarily on the process of providing mental health services and do not sufficiently address consumer and system outcomes. The legislature finds that the authority and the community mental health service delivery system must make ongoing efforts to achieve the purposes set forth in RCW 71.24.015 related to reduced administrative layering, duplication, elimination of process measures not specifically required by the federal government for the receipt of federal funds, and reduced administrative costs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Many offenders with acute and chronic mental illness are delayed in their release from Washington correctional facilities due to their inability to access reasonable treatment and living accommodations prior to the maximum expiration of their sentences. Often the offender reaches the end of his or her sentence and is released without any follow-up care, funds, or housing. These delays are costly to the state, often lead to psychiatric relapse, and result in unnecessary risk to the public.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these offenders lack the skills or emotional stability to maintain employment or even complete applications to receive entitlement funding. Housing and appropriate treatment are difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>This lack of resources, funding, treatment, and housing creates additional stress for the offender with mental illness, impairing self-control and judgment. When the mental illness is instrumental in the offender's patterns of crime, such stresses may lead to a worsening of his or her illness, reoffending, and a threat to public safety.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>It is the intent of the legislature to create a program to provide for postrelease mental health care and housing for a select group of offenders with mental illness entering community living, in order to reduce incarceration costs, increase public safety, and enhance the offender's quality of life.</li>

Additional funding sources may be used to offset these costs when available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The case manager shall collaborate with the assigned prison, work release, or community corrections staff during release planning, prior to discharge, and in ongoing supervision of the offender while under the authority of the department of corrections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medications including the full range of psychotropic medications including atypical antipsychotic medications may be required as a condition of the program. Medication prescription, medication monitoring, and counseling to support offender understanding, acceptance, and compliance with prescribed medication regimens must be included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A systematic effort to engage offenders to continuously involve themselves in current and long-term treatment and appropriate habilitative activities shall be made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classes appropriate to the clinical and living needs of the offender and appropriate to his or her level of understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The case manager shall assist the offender in the application and qualification for entitlement funding, including medicaid, state assistance, and other available government and private assistance at any point that the offender is qualified and resources are available.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence-based, research-based, and promising treatment and recovery services appropriate for target populations, including persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Options for leveraging existing integrated managed care, medicaid waiver, American Indian or Alaska Native fee-for-service behavioral health benefits, and private insurance service capacity for substance use disorders, including but not limited to coordination with managed care organizations, behavioral health administrative services organizations, the Washington health benefit exchange, accountable communities of health, and the office of the insurance commissioner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Framework and design assistance for jurisdictions to assist in compliance with the requirements of RCW 10.31.110 for diversion of individuals with complex or co-occurring behavioral health conditions to community-based care whenever possible and appropriate, and identifying resource gaps that impede jurisdictions in fully realizing the potential impact of this approach;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The design of recovery navigator programs in RCW 71.24.115, including reporting requirements by behavioral health administrative services organizations to monitor the effectiveness of the programs and recommendations for program improvement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposal of a funding framework in which, over time, resources are shifted from punishment sectors to community-based care interventions such that community-based care becomes the primary strategy for addressing and resolving public order issues related to behavioral health conditions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategic grant making to community organizations to promote public understanding and eradicate stigma and prejudice against persons with substance use disorder by promoting hope, empathy, and recovery;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations regarding the appropriate criminal legal system response, if any, to possession of controlled substances;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations regarding the collection and reporting of data that identifies the number of persons law enforcement officers and prosecutors engage related to drug possession and disparities across geographic areas, race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and income. The recommendations shall include, but not be limited to, the number and rate of persons who are diverted from charges to recovery navigator services or other services, who receive services and what type of services, who are charged with simple possession, and who are taken into custody; and</p>

<li>
<p>The plan and related rules adopted by the authority must give due consideration to persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions and the needs of youth. The plan must include the substance use outreach, treatment, and recovery services outlined in RCW 71.24.115 through 71.24.135 which must be available in or accessible by all jurisdictions. These services must be equitably distributed across urban and rural settings. If feasible and appropriate, service initiation shall be made available on demand through 24-hour, seven days a week peer recovery coach response, behavioral health walk-in centers, or other innovative rapid response models. These services must, at a minimum, incorporate the following principles: Establish low barriers to entry and reentry; improve the health and safety of the individual; reduce the harm of substance use and related activity for the public; include integrated and coordinated services; incorporate structural competency and antiracism; use noncoercive methods of engaging and retaining people in treatment and recovery services, including contingency management; consider the unique needs of rural communities; and have a focus on services that increase social determinants of health.</p>

<p>Coordinate its work with the efforts of the blue ribbon commission on the intersection of the criminal justice and behavioral health crisis systems and the crisis response improvement strategy committee established in chapter 302, Laws of 2021.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must submit a preliminary report by December 1, 2021, regarding progress toward the substance use recovery services plan. The authority must submit the final substance use recovery services plan to the governor and the legislature by December 1, 2022.

In addition to seeking public comment under chapter 34.05 RCW, the authority must adopt rules in accordance with the recommendations of the substance use recovery services advisory committee as provided in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with the substance use recovery services advisory committee, the authority must submit a report on the implementation of the substance use recovery services plan to the appropriate committees of the legislature and governor by December 1st of each year, beginning in 2023. This report shall include progress on the substance use disorder continuum of care, including availability of outreach, treatment, and recovery support services statewide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;recovery support services&quot; means a collection of resources that sustain long-term recovery from substance use disorder, including for persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, recovery housing, permanent supportive housing, employment and education pathways, peer supports and recovery coaching, family education, technological recovery supports, transportation and child care assistance, and social connectedness.</p>

<p>The criminal justice treatment account is created in the state treasury. Moneys in the account may be expended solely for: (a) Substance use disorder treatment and treatment support services for offenders with a substance use disorder that, if not treated, would result in addiction, against whom charges are filed by a prosecuting attorney in Washington state; (b) the provision of substance use disorder treatment services and treatment support services for nonviolent offenders within a drug court program; and (c) the administrative and overhead costs associated with the operation of a drug court. Amounts provided in this subsection must be used for treatment and recovery support services for criminally involved offenders and authorization of these services shall not be subject to determinations of medical necessity. During the 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia, funding from the criminal justice treatment account may be used to provide treatment and support services through the conclusion of an individual's treatment plan to individuals participating in a drug court program as of February 24, 2021, if that individual wishes to continue treatment following dismissal of charges they were facing under RCW 69.50.4013(1). Such participation is voluntary and contingent upon substantial compliance with drug court program requirements. During the 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia, the legislature may appropriate from the account for municipal drug courts and increased treatment options. During the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium, the legislature may direct the state treasurer to make transfers of moneys in the criminal justice treatment account to the home security fund account created in RCW 43.185C.060. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Treatment&quot; means services that are critical to a participant's successful completion of his or her substance use disorder treatment program, including but not limited to the recovery support and other programmatic elements outlined in RCW 2.30.030 authorizing therapeutic courts; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Treatment support&quot; includes transportation to or from inpatient or outpatient treatment services when no viable alternative exists, and child care services that are necessary to ensure a participant's ability to attend outpatient treatment sessions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

If appropriate medication-assisted treatment resources are not available or accessible within the jurisdiction, the health care authority's designee for assistance must assist the court with acquiring the resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counties must meet the criteria established in RCW 2.30.030(3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall annually review and monitor the expenditures made by any county or group of counties that receives appropriated funds distributed under this section. Counties shall repay any funds that are not spent in accordance with the requirements of its contract with the authority.</p>

<p>The state of Washington declares that substance use disorders are medical conditions. Substance use disorders should be treated in a manner similar to other medical conditions by using interventions that are supported by evidence, including medications approved by the federal food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder. It is also recognized that many individuals have multiple substance use disorders, as well as histories of trauma, developmental disabilities, or mental health conditions. As such, all individuals experiencing opioid use disorder should be offered evidence-supported treatments to include federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders and behavioral counseling and social supports to address them. For behavioral health agencies, an effective plan of treatment for most persons with opioid use disorder integrates access to medications and psychosocial counseling and should be consistent with the American society of addiction medicine patient placement criteria. Providers must inform patients with opioid use disorder or substance use disorder of options to access federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder or substance use disorder. Because some such medications are controlled substances in chapter 69.50 RCW, the state of Washington maintains the legal obligation and right to regulate the uses of these medications in the treatment of opioid use disorder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must work with other state agencies and stakeholders to develop value-based payment strategies to better support the ongoing care of persons with opioid and other substance use disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of corrections shall develop policies to prioritize services based on available grant funding and funds appropriated specifically for opioid use disorder treatment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must promote the use of medication therapies and other evidence-based strategies to address the opioid epidemic in Washington state. Additionally, by January 1, 2020, the authority must prioritize state resources for the provision of treatment and recovery support services to inpatient and outpatient treatment settings that allow patients to start or maintain their use of medications for opioid use disorder while engaging in services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state declares that the main goals of treatment for persons with opioid use disorder are the cessation of unprescribed opioid use, reduced morbidity, and restoration of the ability to lead a productive and fulfilling life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To achieve the goals in subsection (3) of this section, to promote public health and safety, and to promote the efficient and economic use of funding for the medicaid program under Title XIX of the social security act, the authority may seek, receive, and expend alternative sources of funding to support all aspects of the state's response to the opioid crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must partner with the department of social and health services, the department of corrections, the department of health, the department of children, youth, and families, and any other agencies or entities the authority deems appropriate to develop a statewide approach to leveraging medicaid funding to treat opioid use disorder and provide emergency overdose treatment. Such alternative sources of funding may include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Seeking a section 1115 demonstration waiver from the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services to fund opioid treatment medications for persons eligible for medicaid at or during the time of incarceration and juvenile detention facilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soliciting and receiving private funds, grants, and donations from any willing person or entity.</p>
</li>

<p>The authority shall work with the department of health to promote coordination between medication-assisted treatment prescribers, federally accredited opioid treatment programs, substance use disorder treatment facilities, and state-certified substance use disorder treatment agencies to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Increase patient choice in receiving medication and counseling;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Acknowledge and address the challenges presented for individuals needing treatment for multiple substance use disorders simultaneously; and</p>

<li>
<p>Study and review effective methods to identify and reach out to individuals with opioid use disorder who are at high risk of overdose and not involved in traditional systems of care, such as homeless individuals using syringe service programs, and connect such individuals to appropriate treatment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must work with stakeholders to develop a set of recommendations to the governor and the legislature that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Propose, in addition to those required by federal law, a standard set of services needed to support the complex treatment needs of persons with opioid use disorder treated in opioid treatment programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outline the components of and strategies needed to develop opioid treatment program centers of excellence that provide fully integrated care for persons with opioid use disorder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimate the costs needed to support these models and recommendations for funding strategies that must be included in the report;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outline strategies to increase the number of waivered health care providers approved for prescribing buprenorphine by the substance abuse and mental health services administration; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outline strategies to lower the cost of federal food and drug administration approved products for the treatment of opioid use disorder.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>State agencies shall review and promote positive outcomes associated with the accountable communities of health funded opioid projects and local law enforcement and human services opioid collaborations as set forth in the Washington state interagency opioid working plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority must partner with the department and other state agencies to replicate effective approaches for linking individuals who have had a nonfatal overdose with treatment opportunities, with a goal to connect certified peer counselors with individuals who have had a nonfatal overdose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State agencies must work together to increase outreach and education about opioid overdoses to non-English-speaking communities by developing a plan to conduct outreach and education to non-English-speaking communities. The department must submit a report on the outreach and education plan with recommendations for implementation to the appropriate legislative committees by July 1, 2020.</p>

<p>The behavioral health agency under (a) of this subsection must notify an enrollee's managed care organization as soon as practicable after admitting the enrollee, but not later than twenty-four hours after admitting the enrollee. The time of notification does not reduce the requirements established in (a) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The behavioral health agency under (a) of this subsection must provide the managed care organization with its initial assessment and initial treatment plan for the enrollee within two business days of admission, excluding weekends and holidays, or within three days in the case of a behavioral health agency that provides withdrawal management services.</p>

<p>After the time period in (a) of this subsection and receipt of the material provided under (c)(ii) of this subsection, the managed care organization may initiate a medical necessity review process. Medical necessity review must be based on the standard set of criteria established under RCW 41.05.528. If the health plan determines within one business day from the start of the medical necessity review period and receipt of the material provided under (c)(ii) of this subsection that the admission to the facility was not medically necessary and advises the agency of the decision in writing, the health plan is not required to pay the facility for services delivered after the start of the medical necessity review period, subject to the conclusion of a filed appeal of the adverse benefit determination.

<p>When the treatment plan approved by the managed care organization involves transfer of the enrollee to a different facility or to a lower level of care, the care coordination unit of the managed care organization shall work with the current agency to make arrangements for a seamless transfer as soon as possible to an appropriate and available facility or level of care. The managed care organization shall pay the agency for the cost of care at the current facility until the seamless transfer to the different facility or lower level of care is complete. A seamless transfer to a lower level of care may include same day or next day appointments for outpatient care, and does not include payment for nontreatment services, such as housing services. If placement with an agency in the managed care organization's network is not available, the managed care organization shall pay the current agency at the service level until a seamless transfer arrangement is made.</p>

<p>The steering committee of the crisis response improvement strategy committee established under RCW 71.24.892 must monitor and make recommendations related to the funding of crisis response services out of the account created in RCW 82.86.050. The crisis response improvement strategy steering committee must analyze:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The projected expenditures from the account created under RCW 82.86.050, taking into account call volume, utilization projections, and other operational impacts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The costs of providing statewide coverage of mobile rapid response crisis teams or other behavioral health first responder services recommended by the crisis response improvement strategy committee, based on 988 crisis hotline utilization and taking into account existing state and local funding;</p>

<li>
<p>Potential options to reduce the tax imposed in RCW 82.86.020, given the expected level of costs related to infrastructure development and operational support of the 988 crisis hotline and crisis call center hubs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The viability of providing funding for in-person mobile rapid response crisis services or other behavioral health first responder services recommended by the crisis response improvement strategy committee funded from the account created in RCW 82.86.050, given the expected revenues to the account and the level of expenditures required under (a) of this subsection.</p>
