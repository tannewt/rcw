<h2 id="section-1-2698">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2698">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the importance of internet-accessible learning devices for the ability of students to receive a modern education. When Washington schools closed in March 2020, schools and school districts shifted quickly to offering education in an online environment. Teachers adapted their lessons for videoconferencing platforms and arranged for students to submit homework via email. However, limited opportunities for in-person instruction amplified digital deserts and disparities among students that are likely to continue to grow for the foreseeable future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that students from low-income families face disproportionate barriers to accessing learning over the internet in their homes, partly because they do not have internet-accessible devices appropriate for learning. The legislature also recognizes that accessing learning over the internet requires more than just an internet-accessible device appropriate for learning. For students and their families to be truly connected, they need the digital literacy, digital skills, and digital support to use internet-accessible devices and to navigate the web in support of student learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the goal of the legislature to: Accelerate universal 1:1, which means one learning device for each student, by increasing student access to, and training for, learning devices and other technology-related services and products; expand the provision of training and technical assistance to instructional staff using technology to support student learning; and build the capacity of schools to provide digital navigation services to students and their families.</p>
</li>
</ol>
