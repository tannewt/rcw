<h2 id="section-1-2541">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-2541">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the importance of internet-accessible learning devices to the ability of students to receive a modern education. When Washington schools closed in March 2020, school districts shifted quickly to offering education in an online environment. Teachers adapted their lessons for videoconferencing platforms and arranged for students to submit homework via email. However, distance learning amplified digital deserts and disparities among students that will only continue to grow for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that low-income and Black Washingtonians face disproportionate barriers to accessing internet in their homes. Recent census household pulse survey data shows that a computer is rarely or never available for a child's educational use for 59% of households experiencing poverty and 80% of Black households in Washington state.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the legislature finds that accessing the internet requires more than just a computer. For families and students to be truly connected, they need the digital literacy, skills, and support to use their device and navigate the web.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to provide every student and every educator in Washington with an appropriate learning device as well as the necessary digital literacy support to ensure digital equity and access.</p>
