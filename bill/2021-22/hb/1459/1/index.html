<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the data center industry is experiencing explosive growth across the nation and the competition among states for data center investments has increased dramatically. A department of commerce study, 2018 State of the Data Center Industry, An Analysis of Washington's Competitiveness, found that data center growth in rural Washington is at the lower end of the growth rate experienced by other major competitive markets. If the state desires to attract more projects, Washington should improve its promotional strategy for this industry segment and reexamine the competitiveness of its overall incentives strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to encourage additional investments in data technology facilities that in turn incentivize local economic development, increased local tax revenues, and rural construction and trade jobs through the development of additional data center facilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-1724">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1724">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 3 and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (sections 3 and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes the sales and use tax exemptions on eligible server equipment and eligible power infrastructure equipment at eligible computer data centers as ones intended to: Induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a); improve industry competitiveness as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(b); create or retain jobs as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(c); and reduce structural inefficiencies in the tax structure as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(d).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to maintain and grow the existing data center sector in Washington state, and encourage development of new data center facilities and refurbishment of existing data centers, thereby increasing the competitiveness of Washington's tax structure, which will increase or maintain construction and trade job growth in rural areas, and increase local tax revenue streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preference if a review finds that the tax preference is (a) generating capital investment in new computer data centers, refurbished data centers, and existing data centers (e.g., replacement server equipment), (b) generating state and local tax collections from data center investment and operations, and (c) generating construction and trade jobs in the state. The review must factor in changing economic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any available data source, including data available from the department of revenue regarding rural county property tax assessments and employment data from the employment security department.</p>
