<h2 id="section-1-1242">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1242">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that on June 19, 1865, two and one-half years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and two months after the end of the Civil War, news finally reached Galveston, Texas, that the Civil War had ended and that all enslaved persons were now released from the bondage of slavery. Slavery has left a catastrophic and unrelenting legacy of trauma for generations of Black/African Americans. Racism, discrimination, and inequity have been prevalent throughout the United States of America since 1619, which has cost Black/African Americans life, liberty, and prosperity.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that June 19th has been celebrated in smaller communities across the nation as Juneteenth. Also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Liberation Day, and Emancipation Day, Juneteenth is a holiday that celebrates the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the United States. Although this day has special significance for Black/African Americans in the state of Washington, the historical and continued harms of slavery and the rejoicing of the end of this atrocity should be acknowledged and celebrated by all Washingtonians.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to designate Juneteenth as a state legal holiday to celebrate the end of chattel slavery. The legislature encourages that this be a day to engage in fellowship with Black/African Americans; revisit our solidarity and commitment to antiracism; educate ourselves about slave history; and continue having conversations that uplift every Washingtonian.</p>

<p>Employees of the state and its political subdivisions, including employees of school districts and those nonclassified employees of institutions of higher education who hold appointments or are employed under contracts to perform services for periods of less than twelve consecutive months, are entitled to two unpaid holidays per calendar year for a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization. This includes employees of public institutions of higher education, including community colleges, technical colleges, and workforce training programs. The employee may select the days on which the employee desires to take the two unpaid holidays after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority. If an employee prefers to take the two unpaid holidays on specific days for a reason of faith or conscience, or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization, the employer must allow the employee to do so unless the employee's absence would impose an undue hardship on the employer or the employee is necessary to maintain public safety.
