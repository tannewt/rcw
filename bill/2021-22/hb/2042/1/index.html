<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that parents are uniquely and exclusively suited to making decisions about their children, including education decisions. It is imperative that Washington state empowers and supports parents and students to choose the educational environment that best suits their needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the state has authorized many education options including traditional public schools, charter schools, home-based instruction, and private schools. While many students are currently benefiting from these options, there are more students who desire access to these education alternatives and outcomes. However, there are many parents who do not have the means to choose the option that is best for their children. This increases inequity in the education system with the parents and children with the least means, but the most need, trapped in a failing school or a school that does not otherwise meet their needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the paramount duty of the state is to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, economic status, or sex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature realizes the need to provide for in-person or hybrid schooling models for optimum learning for students, especially when public schools are not offering these options, for example during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that with the recent United States supreme court decision in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, 140 S.Ct. 2246 (2020), now is the time to remedy years of funding inequity for students who are not in the public school system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to establish a program that addresses educational inequities for students both inside and outside the public school system. The program will empower parents to choose the educational environment that best suits their children's unique needs by providing K-12 education scholarships.</p>
</li>
