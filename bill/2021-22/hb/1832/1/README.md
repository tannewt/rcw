If the resolution or petition proposes a plan of government other than those authorized in chapters 35A.12 RCW and 35A.13 RCW of this title, the resolution or petition shall specify the class under which such city will be classified upon adoption of such plan.

2. **A resolution proposing abandonment of a city's current plan of government and the adoption of a council-manager plan of government under subsection (1) of this section may be combined with a resolution proposing to designate the person elected to council position one as the chair of the council as described in RCW 35A.13.033, and such a combined proposal may be placed before the voters of the city as a single proposition.**
