<p>The legislature hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sexual assault is a serious crime in society, affecting a large number of children, women, and men each year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efforts over many years to distribute information and collect data have demonstrated the incidence of sexual assault that continues to impact communities, families, and individuals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the past three decades, law enforcement, prosecutors, medical professionals, educators, mental health providers, public health professionals, and victim advocates have benefited from a commitment to training and learning regarding appropriate responses to and services for victims of sexual assault;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This same effort has resulted in increased public awareness of sexual assault and its impact on communities, families, and individuals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law enforcement, prosecutors, medical professionals, educators, mental health providers, public health professionals, and victim advocates should continue to work closely and collaboratively to improve responses to and services for victims of sexual assault;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The physical, emotional, financial, and psychological needs of victims and their families are particularly well-served by timely and effective services provided in local communities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who are victims of sexual assault benefit directly from continued public awareness and education, prosecutions of offenders, a criminal justice system which treats them in a humane manner, and access to victim-centered, culturally relevant services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
