Except as otherwise provided in this section, the privileges and requirements of a craft cannabis producer/processor license issued under this section are the same privileges and requirements of a marijuana producer license and of a marijuana processor license issued under RCW 69.50.325. To qualify for a craft cannabis producer/processor license an applicant must meet all qualifications for a marijuana license in RCW 69.50.331.</p>

<p>The board shall establish a reduced application fee and reduced license fee for a craft cannabis producer/processor applicant or licensee who meets the definition of a social equity applicant in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an applicant who switches from operating under two marijuana producer licenses to one license under this section, the annual license fee is $4,143 if the licensee is authorized to have up to an additional 30,000 square feet of seasonal sungrown production canopy in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. For an applicant who switches from operating under three marijuana producer licenses to one license under this section, the license fee is $5,524 if the licensee is authorized to have up to an additional 60,000 square feet of seasonal sungrown production canopy in accordance with subsection (3) of this section.</p>

<p>The holder of a craft cannabis producer/processor license may not hold any other marijuana license issued under this chapter, including another craft cannabis producer/processor license, or have an ownership interest in, management role in, or exercise control over a business or entity that holds any other marijuana license or craft cannabis producer/processor license issued under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, a craft cannabis producer/processor licensee is subject to the following production and processing limits:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If production is indoors, the licensee may have no more than 10,000 square feet of production canopy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If production is seasonal sungrown production, the licensee may have no more than 30,000 square feet of production canopy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If production is at a facility at which marijuana is cultivated by indoor production and seasonal sungrown production, the licensee must have less than 10,000 square feet of indoor production canopy. Additionally, the licensee may have seasonal sungrown production canopy equal to three times the difference between 10,000 square feet and the number of square feet of indoor production canopy authorized for the licensee. By way of example, without limiting the authorized combinations of indoor and seasonal sungrown production canopy under this subsection (3)(b)(iii), a licensee may have:</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p>(A) Four thousand square feet of indoor production canopy and 18,000 square feet of seasonal sungrown production canopy;</p>

<p>Pursuant to rules adopted by the board by January 1, 2022, licensees may make retail sales of marijuana products produced and processed entirely by the craft cannabis producer/processor from the licensed production facility. The retail sales limits in RCW 69.50.360(3) apply to retail sales authorized under this subsection. All taxes applicable to retail sales of marijuana by a marijuana retailer apply to retail sales of marijuana products by a craft cannabis producer/processor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of local zoning and land use ordinances, retail sales of marijuana by a licensee under this section are considered ancillary to, and do not alter, the primary use of the property as an agricultural, industrial, or commercial use.

<p>There is a maximum number of licenses available under this section. The board shall issue no more than 50 new craft cannabis producer/processor licenses to social equity applicants as defined in this section. A social equity applicant must submit a social equity plan with the license application. In determining the issuance of a license among social equity applicants, the board may prioritize applicants based on the extent to which the application addresses the components of the social equity plan. The board may deny any application submitted under this subsection if the board determines that the application does not meet social equity goals, does not meet social equity plan requirements, or the application does not otherwise meet the licensing requirements of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to licenses issued through (c)(i) of this subsection, the board shall issue a craft cannabis producer/processor license to all currently licensed marijuana producers who qualify and choose to be licensed under this section instead of RCW 69.50.325.</p>
