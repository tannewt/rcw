<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes and respects the sovereign status of the federally recognized Indian tribes and the state in a government-to-government relationship and seeks to enhance and improve communications and facilitate resolution of issues between federally recognized Indian tribes and the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that in 1989, the governor signed the centennial accord on behalf of the state, along with federally recognized Indian tribes of the state, to achieve mutual tribal-state goals through an improved relationship and shared respect between sovereign governments. The centennial accord provided a framework and procedures for implementing this government-to-government relationship. In 1999, the governor and the federally recognized Indian tribes signed the new millennium agreement, which reaffirmed the commitments of the centennial accord, and strengthened the foundation for government-to-government relations and cooperation. The new millennium agreement specifically called upon the legislature &quot;... to establish a structure to address issues of mutual concern to the state and tribes.&quot; Washington has also recognized a similar commitment to government-to-government relationships with federally recognized Indian tribes located out-of-state who have treaty reserved rights within Washington. The Yakama Nation has not signed onto any of the mentioned agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the executive branch has established and continues its efforts to improve and promote a government-to-government relationship and further recognizes, as a coequal branch of state government, its own responsibility and role in maintaining a government-to-government relationship with the federally recognized Indian tribes of this state and federally recognized Indian tribes located out-of-state with treaty reserved rights within Washington. The legislature has a particular concern and interest in growing and maintaining strong relationships with the federally recognized Indian tribes to preserve, protect, and manage resources, and recognizes that the tribes have specific treaty rights including, but not limited to, the right of taking fish and the privilege to hunt within the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For these reasons, the legislature intends to establish a joint legislative tribal-state relations committee to address issues of mutual concern to the federally recognized Indian tribes and the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
