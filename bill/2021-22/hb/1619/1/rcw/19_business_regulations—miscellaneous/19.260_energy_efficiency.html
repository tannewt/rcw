<p>The legislature finds that appliance standards and design requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For certain products sold or installed in the state assure consumers and businesses that such products meet minimum efficiency performance levels thus saving money on utility bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save energy and reduce pollution and other environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution, and use of electricity and natural gas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute to the economy of Washington by helping to better balance energy supply and demand, thus reducing pressure for higher natural gas and electricity prices. By saving consumers and businesses money on energy bills, efficiency standards help the state and local economy, since energy bill savings can be spent on local goods and services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can make electricity systems more reliable by reducing the strain on the electricity grid during peak demand periods. Furthermore, improved energy efficiency can reduce or delay the need for new power plants, power transmission lines, and power distribution system upgrades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help ensure renters have the same access to energy efficient appliances as homeowners.</p>

<p>The department may adopt rules that incorporate by reference federal efficiency standards for federally covered products only as the standards existed on January 1, 2018. The department, in consultation with the office of the attorney general, must regularly submit a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature on federal standards that preempt the state standards set forth in RCW 19.260.040. Any report on federal preemption must be transmitted at least thirty days before the start of any regular legislative session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may recommend updates to the energy efficiency standards and test methods for products listed in RCW 19.260.030. The department may also recommend establishing state standards for additional nonfederally covered products. In making its recommendations, the department shall use the following criteria: (a) Multiple manufacturers produce products that meet the proposed standard at the time of recommendation; (b) products meeting the proposed standard are available at the time of recommendation; (c) the products are cost-effective to consumers on a life-cycle cost basis using average Washington resource rates; (d) the utility of the energy efficient product meets or exceeds the utility of the comparable product available for purchase; and (e) the standard exists in at least two other states in the United States. For recommendations concerning commercial clothes washers, the department must also consider the fiscal effects on the low-income, elderly, and student populations. Any recommendations shall be transmitted to the appropriate committees of the legislature sixty days before the start of any regular legislative session.</p>

The department shall establish rules governing the identification of these products and packaging, which shall be coordinated to the greatest practical extent with the labeling programs of other states and federal agencies with equivalent efficiency standards. Manufacturers of general service lamps that meet the efficiency standards under RCW 19.260.040 are not required to label each individual lamp offered for sale or installation in the state.</p>

<p>An electric storage water heater, if manufactured on or after January 1, 2021, may not be installed, sold, or offered for sale, lease, or rent in the state unless it complies with the following design requirement:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The product must have a modular demand response communications port compliant with: (i) The March 2018 version of the ANSI/CTA–2045-A communication interface standard, or equivalent and (ii) the March 2018 version of the ANSI/CTA-2045-A application layer requirements.</p>
