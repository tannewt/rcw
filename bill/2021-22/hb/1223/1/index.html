<h2 id="section-3-1590">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-1590">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided by sections 5 through 10 of this act, a custodial interrogation, including the giving of any required warning, advice of the rights of the individual being questioned, and the waiver of any rights by the individual, must be recorded electronically in its entirety if the interrogation subject is a juvenile or if the interrogation relates to a felony crime. A custodial interrogation at a place of detention must be recorded by both audio and video means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a law enforcement officer conducts a custodial interrogation to which subsection (1) of this section applies without electronically recording it in its entirety, the officer shall prepare a written or electronic report explaining the reason for not complying with this section and summarizing the custodial interrogation process and the individual's statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A law enforcement officer shall prepare the report required by subsection (2) of this section as soon as practicable after completing the interrogation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as practicable, a law enforcement officer conducting a custodial interrogation outside a place of detention shall prepare a written report explaining the decision to interrogate outside a place of detention and summarizing the custodial interrogation process and the individual's statements made outside a place of detention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not apply to a spontaneous statement made outside the course of a custodial interrogation or a statement made in response to a question asked routinely during the processing of the arrest of an individual.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4-1251">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-1251">¶</a></h2>
<p>Notwithstanding RCW 9.73.030 and 9.73.090, a law enforcement officer conducting a custodial interrogation is not required to obtain consent to electronic recording from the individual being interrogated, but must inform the individual that an electronic recording is being made of the interrogation. This chapter does not permit a law enforcement officer or a law enforcement agency to record a private communication between an individual and the individual's lawyer.</p>
<h2 id="section-5-1021">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-1021">¶</a></h2>
<p>A custodial interrogation to which section 3 of this act otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically if recording is not feasible because of exigent circumstances. The law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation shall record electronically an explanation of the exigent circumstances before conducting the interrogation, if feasible, or as soon as practicable after the interrogation is completed.</p>
<h2 id="section-6-813">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-813">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A custodial interrogation to which section 3 of this act otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically if the individual to be interrogated indicates that the individual will not participate in the interrogation if it is recorded electronically. If feasible, the agreement to participate without recording must be recorded electronically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, during a custodial interrogation to which section 3 of this act otherwise applies, the individual being interrogated indicates that the individual will not participate in further interrogation unless electronic recording ceases, the remainder of the custodial interrogation need not be recorded electronically. If feasible, the individual's agreement to participate without further recording must be recorded electronically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A law enforcement officer, with intent to avoid the requirement of electronic recording in section 3 of this act, may not encourage an individual to request that a recording not be made.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-7-693">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-693">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a custodial interrogation occurs in another state in compliance with that state's law or is conducted by a federal law enforcement agency in compliance with federal law, the interrogation need not be recorded electronically unless the interrogation is conducted with intent to avoid the requirement of electronic recording in section 3 of this act.</p>
<h2 id="section-8-589">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-589">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A custodial interrogation to which section 3 of this act otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically if the interrogation occurs when no law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation has knowledge of facts and circumstances that would lead an officer reasonably to believe that the individual being interrogated may have committed an act for which section 3 of this act requires that a custodial interrogation be recorded electronically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, during a custodial interrogation under subsection (1) of this section, the individual being interrogated reveals facts and circumstances giving a law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation reason to believe that an act has been committed for which section 3 of this act requires that a custodial interrogation be recorded electronically, continued custodial interrogation concerning that act must be recorded electronically, if feasible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-9-493">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-493">¶</a></h2>
<p>A custodial interrogation to which section 3 of this act otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically if a law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation or the officer's superior reasonably believes that electronic recording would disclose the identity of a confidential informant or jeopardize the safety of an officer, the individual being interrogated, or another individual. If feasible and consistent with the safety of a confidential informant, an explanation of the basis for the belief that electronic recording would disclose the informant's identity must be recorded electronically at the time of the interrogation. If contemporaneous recording of the basis for the belief is not feasible, the recording must be made as soon as practicable after the interrogation is completed.</p>
<h2 id="section-10-429">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10-429">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All or part of a custodial interrogation to which section 3 of this act otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically to the extent that recording is not feasible because the available electronic recording equipment fails, despite reasonable maintenance of the equipment, and timely repair or replacement is not feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If both audio and video recording of a custodial interrogation are otherwise required by section 3 of this act, recording may be by audio alone if a technical problem in the video recording equipment prevents video recording, despite reasonable maintenance of the equipment, and timely repair or replacement is not feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If both audio and video recording of a custodial interrogation are otherwise required by section 3 of this act, recording may be by video alone if a technical problem in the audio recording equipment prevents audio recording, despite reasonable maintenance of the equipment, and timely repair or replacement is not feasible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-11-385">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-385">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the prosecution relies on an exception in sections 5 through 10 of this act to justify a failure to record electronically a custodial interrogation, the prosecution must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the exception applies.</p>
<h2 id="section-12-329">Section 12 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12-329">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the prosecution intends to introduce in its case in chief a statement made during a custodial interrogation to which section 3 of this act applies which was not recorded electronically, the prosecution, not later than the time specified by the local rules governing discovery, shall serve the defendant with written notice of that intent and of any exception on which the prosecution intends to rely.</p>
<h2 id="section-13-297">Section 13 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-13-297">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unless the court finds that an exception in sections 5 through 10 of this act applies, the court shall consider the failure to record electronically all or part of a custodial interrogation to which section 3 of this act applies in determining whether a statement made during the interrogation is admissible, including whether it was voluntarily made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court admits into evidence a statement made during a custodial interrogation that was not recorded electronically in compliance with section 3 of this act, the court, on request of the defendant, shall give a cautionary instruction to the jury.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-14-252">Section 14 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14-252">¶</a></h2>
