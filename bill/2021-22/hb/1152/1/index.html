<h2 id="section-1-3424">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3424">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds the COVID-19 pandemic has been the most difficult challenge in Washington's public health history since the 1918 flu pandemic. More Americans have died from COVID-19 than the number of United States troops killed in combat during World War II. The COVID-19 pandemic response has stressed and strained every part of our society and far surpassed the capabilities of local, state, tribal, and even federal public health agencies. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the legislature had initiated action to address the critical challenges Washington's public health system faces, including limited organizational capacity, financial resources, and understaffing through beginning to specifically fund foundational public health services. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the shortcomings of Washington's current public health system which have been studied and identified for over a decade. Washington's current public health system was not able to consistently monitor and track the pandemic, staff the many required missions, adequately address the health inequities, and implement standard approaches to disease containment.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that, in Washington, local health services are currently provided through a decentralized means by 35 local health jurisdictions. In many cases, rural communities are served by smaller local health jurisdictions that have less capacity to provide the full spectrum of foundational public health services than their urban peers. Local health jurisdictions serving smaller populations face challenges providing the full spectrum of foundational public health services and activities to promote and protect the health of all people. In addition, local health jurisdictions are overseen by boards in which most the members do not have direct experience in public health or health care. Since April 2020, a Kaiser health news investigation reports at least 181 local and state health leaders have resigned, retired, or been fired, including 11 local health leaders in Washington. Diseases do not respect borders or boundaries, yet the current decentralized system in Washington creates a patchwork approach with limited accountability and consistency. National peer-review studies report larger jurisdictions perform better on most foundational comprehensive public health services. Therefore, the legislature finds comprehensive public health districts comprising larger populations, balanced governance, and interdependence between all levels of the public health system will increase accountability, effectiveness, and performance in delivering foundational public health services.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the health and social inequities in Washington that existed before its emergence. There are vast inequities in per capita spending for local public health services by population size and geographic location. National peer-review studies report communities with limited public health systems experience low levels of activity participation, low perceived effectiveness, and sparse organizational networks compared to comprehensive public health systems. The inequitable distribution of morbidity and mortality between Black, indigenous, and people of color and other populations demonstrates the large health inequities that must be addressed. Therefore, the legislature finds the state must determine adequate funding of comprehensive public health districts from cities, counties, and the state, with the goal of providing all people with equitable access to foundational public health services, and once this funding is determined, the legislature finds this investment in the public's health will continue to be prioritized.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that public health and health care staff have been overwhelmed, overworked and their mental and physical health are at risk due to the pandemic. The legislature is thankful for the countless contributions that public health and health care staff have made to combat this deadly public health crisis and pandemic. These contributions and efforts have increased public awareness about the importance of strong infrastructure for our public health system. Therefore, the legislature finds that meaningful discourse about the current public health system is necessary to ensure public trust.</p>
<p>The legislature expects emergencies that threaten the health and well-being of all Washingtonians, emergent and routine, to increase. Restructuring state funding of foundational public health services is not enough to face these threats. The legislature intends for Washington to have a public health system that can respond to 21st century public health emergencies and public health issues, have the capacity to improve health outcomes of BIPOC communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ+, rural communities, limited English-speaking persons, and address health equity across the life span.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the mortality rate in Washington state among infants and children less than eighteen years of age is unacceptably high, and that such mortality may be preventable. The legislature further finds that, through the performance of child mortality reviews, preventable causes of child mortality can be identified and addressed, thereby reducing the infant and child mortality in Washington state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to encourage the performance of child death reviews by <strong>district</strong> health departments by providing necessary legal protections to the families of children whose deaths are studied, <strong>district</strong> health department officials and employees, and health care professionals participating in child mortality review committee activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;child mortality review&quot; means a process authorized by a <strong>district</strong> health department as such department is defined in RCW 70.05.010 for examining factors that contribute to deaths of children less than eighteen years of age. The process may include a systematic review of medical, clinical, and hospital records; home interviews of parents and caretakers of children who have died; analysis of individual case information; and review of this information by a team of professionals in order to identify modifiable medical, socioeconomic, public health, behavioral, administrative, educational, and environmental factors associated with each death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>District</strong> health departments are authorized to conduct child mortality reviews. In conducting such reviews, the following provisions shall apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All health care information collected as part of a child mortality review is confidential, subject to the restrictions on disclosure provided for in chapter 70.02 RCW. When documents are collected as part of a child mortality review, the records may be used solely by <strong>district</strong> health departments for the purposes of the review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No identifying information related to the deceased child, the child's guardians, or anyone interviewed as part of the child mortality review may be disclosed. Any such information shall be redacted from any records produced as part of the review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any witness statements or documents collected from witnesses, or summaries or analyses of those statements or records prepared exclusively for purposes of a child mortality review, are not subject to public disclosure, discovery, subpoena, or introduction into evidence in any administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding related to the death of a child reviewed. This provision does not restrict or limit the discovery or subpoena from a health care provider of records or documents maintained by such health care provider in the ordinary course of business, whether or not such records or documents may have been supplied to a <strong>district</strong> health department pursuant to this section. This provision shall not restrict or limit the discovery or subpoena of documents from such witnesses simply because a copy of a document was collected as part of a child mortality review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No <strong>district</strong> health department official or employee, and no members of technical committees established to perform case reviews of selected child deaths may be examined in any administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding as to the existence or contents of documents assembled, prepared, or maintained for purposes of a child mortality review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section shall not be construed to prohibit or restrict any person from reporting suspected child abuse or neglect under chapter 26.44 RCW nor to limit access to or use of any records, documents, information, or testimony in any civil or criminal action arising out of any report made pursuant to chapter 26.44 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall assist <strong>district</strong> health departments to collect the reports of any child mortality reviews conducted by <strong>district</strong> health departments and assist with entering the reports into a database to the extent that the data is not protected under subsection (3) of this section. Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, the department shall respond to any requests for data from the database to the extent permitted for health care information under chapter 70.02 RCW. In addition, the department shall provide technical assistance to <strong>district</strong> health departments and child death review coordinators conducting child mortality reviews and encourage communication among child death review teams. The department shall conduct these activities using only federal and private funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not prevent a <strong>district</strong> health department from publishing statistical compilations and reports related to the child mortality review. Any portions of such compilations and reports that identify individual cases and sources of information must be redacted.</p>

<p>A law enforcement officer, firefighter, health care provider, health care facility staff person, department of corrections' staff person, jail staff person, or person employed in other categories of employment to be at risk of exposure that presents a possible risk of transmission of a blood-borne pathogen, who has experienced an exposure to another person's bodily fluids in the course of his or her employment, may request a state or <strong>district</strong> health officer to order blood-borne pathogen testing for the person whose bodily fluids he or she has been exposed to. If the state or <strong>district</strong> health officer refuses to order testing under this section, the person who made the request may petition the superior court for a hearing to determine whether an order shall be issued. The hearing on the petition shall be held within seventy-two hours of filing the petition, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The standard of review to determine whether the state or <strong>district</strong> health officer shall be required to issue the order is whether an exposure occurred and whether that exposure presents a possible risk of transmission of a blood-borne pathogen. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the court shall issue the appropriate order.</p>
<p>The person who is subject to the state or <strong>district</strong> health officer's order to receive testing shall be given written notice of the order promptly, personally, and confidentially, stating the grounds and provisions of the order, including the factual basis therefor. If the person who is subject to the order refuses to comply, the state or <strong>district</strong> health officer may petition the superior court for a hearing. The hearing on the petition shall be held within seventy-two hours of filing the petition, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The standard of review for the order is whether an exposure occurred and whether that exposure presents a possible risk of transmission of a blood-borne pathogen. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the court shall issue the appropriate order.</p>
<p>The state or <strong>district</strong> health officer shall perform testing under this section if he or she finds that the exposure presents a possible risk of transmission of a blood-borne pathogen or if he or she is ordered to do so by a court.</p>
<p>The testing required under this section shall be completed as soon as possible after the substantial exposure or, if ordered by the court, within seventy-two hours of the order's issuance.</p>

<p>Jail administrators, with the approval of the <strong>district</strong> health officer, may order blood-borne pathogen testing for a person detained in the jail if the <strong>district</strong> health officer determines that the detainee's behavior exposed the staff, general public, or other persons, and that exposure presents a possible risk of transmitting a blood-borne pathogen. Documentation of the behavior shall be reviewed with the person to ensure that the person understands the basis for testing.</p>
