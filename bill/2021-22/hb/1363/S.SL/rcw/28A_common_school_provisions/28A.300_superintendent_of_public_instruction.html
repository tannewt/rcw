<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall, where it is practicable to do so within available resources, prepare school district fiscal notes on proposed legislation that increases or decreases, or tends to increase or decrease, school district revenues or expenditures in a manner that uniquely affects school districts. Proposed legislation that uniquely affects school districts includes, but is not limited to, legislation that affects school districts' responsibilities as providers of educational services under this title, as employers under chapter 41.59 RCW, or as excess levy taxing authorities under RCW 84.52.053 and 84.52.0531, but excludes proposed legislation that affects school districts only in the same manner that it affects other units of local government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where practicable, the school district fiscal note shall show the fiscal impact of the proposed legislation on each school district. Where it is not practicable to do so, the school district fiscal note shall show the effect of the legislation on a range of representative school districts. The fiscal note must set forth any assumptions that were used in selecting the representative districts, along with any other assumptions made about the fiscal impact.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a statewide student assessment system should improve and inform classroom instruction, support accountability, and provide useful information to all levels of the educational system, including students, parents, teachers, schools, school districts, and the state. The legislature intends to redesign the current statewide system, in accordance with the recommendations of the Washington assessment of student learning legislative work group, to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Include multiple assessment formats, including both formative and summative, as necessary to provide information to help improve instruction and inform accountability;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable collection of data that allows both statewide and nationwide comparisons of student learning and achievement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be balanced so that the information used to make significant decisions that affect school accountability or student educational progress includes many data points and does not rely on solely the results of a single assessment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that one component of the assessment system should be instructionally supportive formative assessments. The key design elements or characteristics of an instructionally supportive assessment must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Be aligned to state standards in areas that are being assessed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure student growth and competency at multiple points throughout the year in a manner that allows instructors to monitor student progress and have the necessary trend data with which to improve instruction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide rapid feedback;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link student growth with instructional elements in order to gauge the effectiveness of educators and curricula;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide tests that are appropriate to the skill level of the student;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support instruction for students of all abilities, including highly capable students and students with learning disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be culturally, linguistically, and cognitively relevant, appropriate, and understandable to each student taking the assessment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform parents and draw parents into greater participation of the student's study plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a way to analyze the assessment results relative to characteristics of the student such as, but not limited to, English language learners, gender, ethnicity, poverty, age, and disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strive to be computer-based and adaptive; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage students in their learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that a second component of the assessment system should be a state-administered summative achievement assessment that can be used as a check on the educational system in order to guide state expectations for the instruction of children and satisfy legislative demands for accountability. The key design elements or characteristics of the state administered achievement assessment must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Be aligned to state standards in areas that are being assessed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain and increase academic rigor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measure student learning growth over years; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that a third component of the assessment system should include classroom-based assessments, which may be formative, summative, or both. Depending on their use, classroom-based assessments should have the same design elements and characteristics described in this section for formative and summative assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that to sustain a strong and viable assessment system, preservice and ongoing training should be provided for teachers and administrators on the effective use of different types of assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that as the statewide data system is developed, data should be collected for all state-required statewide assessments to be used for accountability and to monitor overall student achievement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the state board of education, shall begin design and development of an overall assessment system that meets the principles and characteristics described in this section. In designing formative and summative assessments, the superintendent shall solicit bids for the use of computerized adaptive testing methodologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning December 1, 2009, and annually thereafter, the superintendent and state board shall jointly report to the legislature regarding the assessment system, including a cost analysis of any changes and costs to expand availability and use of instructionally supportive formative assessments.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Supporting a school-based approach to promoting the success of all students by coordinating academic and nonacademic supports to reduce barriers to academic achievement and educational attainment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fulfilling a vision of public education where educators focus on education, students focus on learning, and auxiliary supports enable teaching and learning to occur unimpeded;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging the creation, expansion, and quality improvement of community-based supports that can be integrated into the academic environment of schools and school districts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing public awareness of the evidence showing that academic outcomes are a result of both academic and nonacademic factors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting statewide and local organizations in their efforts to provide leadership, coordination, technical assistance, professional development, and advocacy to implement high quality, evidence-based, student-centered, coordinated approaches throughout the state.</p>

<p>The Washington integrated student supports protocol must be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the unique needs of schools and districts across the state, yet sufficiently structured to provide all students with the individual support they need for academic success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The essential framework of the Washington integrated student supports protocol includes:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Needs assessments: A system-level needs assessment with resource mapping must be conducted in order to identify academic and nonacademic supports that are currently available or lacking in schools, school districts, and the community. A student-level needs assessment must be conducted for all at-risk students in order to develop or identify the needed academic and nonacademic supports within the students' school and community. These supports must be coordinated to provide students with a package of mutually reinforcing supports designed to meet the individual needs of each student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration and coordination: The school and district leadership and staff must establish clear, cooperative policies and procedures with community-based and other out-of-school providers of academic and nonacademic supports to enhance the effectiveness of the protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community partnerships: Community partners must be engaged to provide academic, nonacademic, and social-emotional supports to reduce barriers to students' academic success, including supports to students' families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data driven: Students' needs and outcomes must be tracked over time to determine student progress and evolving needs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The framework must facilitate the ability of any academic or nonacademic provider to support the needs of at-risk students, including, but not limited to: Out-of-school providers, social workers, mental health counselors, physicians, dentists, speech therapists, and audiologists.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In order to adequately prepare our youth for their meaningful participation in our democratic institutions and processes, there must be strong educational resources aimed at teaching students and the public about the fragile nature of our constitutional rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federal commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians was established by congress in 1980 to review the facts and circumstances surrounding executive order 9066, issued on February 19, 1942, and the impact of the executive order on American citizens and permanent residents, and to recommend appropriate remedies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The commission of [on] wartime relocation and internment of civilians issued a report of its findings in 1983 with the reports &quot;Personal Justice Denied&quot; and &quot;Personal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations.&quot; The reports were based on information gathered through twenty days of hearings in cities across the country, particularly the west coast. Testimony was heard from more than seven hundred fifty witnesses, including evacuees, former government officials, public figures, interested citizens, historians, and other professionals who have studied the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The lessons to be learned from the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II are embodied in &quot;Personal Justice Denied-Part II, Recommendations&quot; which found that executive order 9066 was not justified by military necessity, and the decisions that followed from it were not founded upon military considerations. These decisions included the exclusion and detention of American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese descent. The broad historical causes that shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. Widespread ignorance about Americans of Japanese descent contributed to a policy conceived in haste and executed in an atmosphere of fear and anger at Japan. A grave personal injustice was done to the American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry who, without individual review or any probative evidence against them were excluded, removed, and detained by the United States during World War II.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry by the evacuation, relocation, and internment of civilians during World War II. These actions were carried out without adequate security reasons and without any documented acts of espionage or sabotage, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. The excluded individuals of Japanese ancestry suffered enormous damages, both material and intangible, and there were incalculable losses in education and job training, all of which resulted in significant human suffering for which appropriate compensation has not been made. For these fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights of these individuals of Japanese ancestry, the United States congress apologized on behalf of the nation in the federal civil liberties act of 1988.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall create a competitive grant process to evaluate and award state-funded grants to school districts to increase identification of students experiencing homelessness and the capacity of the districts to provide support for students experiencing homelessness. Funds may be used in a manner that is complementary to federal McKinney-Vento funds and consistent with allowable uses as determined by the office of the superintendent of public instruction. The process must complement any similar federal grant program or programs in order to minimize agency overhead and administrative costs for the superintendent of public instruction and school districts. School districts may access both federal and state funding to identify and support students experiencing homelessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Award criteria for the state grants must be based on the demonstrated need of the school district and may consider the number or overall percentage, or both, of homeless children and youths enrolled in preschool, elementary, and secondary schools in the school district, and the ability of the local school district to meet these needs. Award criteria for these must also be based on the quality of the applications submitted. Selected grantees must reflect geographic diversity across the state. Greater weight must be given to districts that demonstrate a commitment to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Partnering with local housing and community-based organizations with experience in serving the needs of students experiencing homelessness or students of color;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serving the needs of unaccompanied youth; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing evidence-informed strategies to address the opportunity gap and other systemic inequities that negatively impact students experiencing homelessness and students of color. Specific strategies may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Enhancing the cultural responsiveness of current and future staff;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring all staff, faculty, and school employees are actively trained in trauma-informed care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing inclusive programming by intentionally seeking and utilizing input from the population being served;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a multidisciplinary approach when serving students experiencing homelessness and their families;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intentionally seeking and utilizing input from the families and students experiencing homelessness about how district policies, services, and practices can be improved; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying data elements and systems needed to monitor progress in eliminating disparities in academic outcomes for students experiencing homelessness with their housed peers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of each academic year, districts receiving grants shall monitor and report on the academic outcomes for students served by the grants. The academic outcomes are those recommended by the office of the superintendent of public instruction. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall review the reports submitted by the districts and assist school districts in using these data to identify gaps and needs, and develop sustainable strategies to improve academic outcomes for students experiencing homelessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students experiencing homelessness are defined as students without a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence in accordance with the definition of homeless children and youths in the federal McKinney-Vento homeless assistance act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11431 through 11435.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts may not use funds allocated under this section to supplant existing federal, state, or local resources for supports for students experiencing homelessness, which may include education liaisons.</p>
