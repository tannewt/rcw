<p>For purposes of the regulatory process established in this chapter, the department may consider any product identified in the department's final PFAS chemical action plan dated November 2021 as a source of or use of PFAS chemicals to be a priority consumer product under this chapter. No additional action, including publication in the Washington State Register, is required for the department to designate such a product as a priority consumer product for purposes of this chapter. For such products, the department may, under the process established in RCW 70A.350.040, determine regulatory actions and adopt rules to implement those regulatory determinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firefighting personal protective equipment, as defined in RCW 70A.400.005, is established as a priority consumer product for PFAS chemicals.</p>

<p>For the products identified in this section, the department is directed to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Determine an initial set of regulatory actions under this chapter by June 1, 2024; and</p>
