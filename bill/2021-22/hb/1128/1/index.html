<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Housing for low-income and middle-income households is a public purpose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing local governments with more options to increase residential capacity, especially in urban areas, consistent with RCW 43.21C.420 is essential to fulfill this public purpose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A history of segregation and displacement has led to disparities in access to education, living wage employment, affordable housing, and transportation, particularly for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities. This history has also allowed certain populations to obtain and build wealth and to access critical resources at the expense of others. Over time these factors have put pressure on, marginalized, and displaced many from these same communities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Black, Hispanic, and American Indian residents in the King, Pierce, and Snohomish county region experience disproportionate housing cost burden and are more likely to be renters than homeowners. According to 2018 data from the federal housing and urban development department, the rates of homeownership for Black residents were half the rate for White residents of the region. Black renters are also 30 percent more likely to be cost-burdened than White renters, and Black homeowners are 38 percent more likely to be cost-burdened than White homeowners. Similar disparities exist for Hispanic populations whose rates of homeownership are 58 percent of the rate of White homeownership, are 17 percent more likely to be rental cost-burdened than White renters, and 25 percent more likely to be owner cost-burdened than White homeowners. American Indian populations have rates of homeownership that are 71 percent that of White residents, are 12 percent more likely to be rental cost-burdened than White renters, and eight percent more likely to be owner cost-burdened than White homeowners;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the fair housing equity assessment for the central Puget Sound region published by the Puget Sound regional council in 2014:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Black residents continue to be the most segregated racial group in the region, which data suggests cannot be explained by income differences among racial groups; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>White and Asian residents are more likely to live in census tracts with high or very high access to opportunity relative to the total population when compared to foreign-born, American Indian, Hispanic, and Black residents who are more likely to live in census tracts with low or very low access to opportunity relative to the total population. Living in poverty is associated with a higher likelihood of living in an area of low or very low access to opportunity, but this cannot explain why Black and Hispanic persons living in poverty are more likely to live in areas of low or very low access to opportunity than their White or Asian peers;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publicly funded salaried professionals and paraprofessionals such as teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, nurses, social workers, and transit operators cannot afford to live in the districts in which they serve due to increasing housing costs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees of nonprofit organizations who help deliver essential public services on contract, as well as those who help provide essential services to the poor and infirm as part of their organizational mission, are similarly housing cost-constrained;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure to make adequate provision for low-income and middle-income housing pushes many households to seek housing further away from work, which leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, as well as congestion on state managed transportation infrastructure, so providing for more low-income and middle-income housing would enable the state to better meet established goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and commute trip reduction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better public policy outcomes, including improvements and benefits to transportation infrastructure and business, will occur if public servants and nonprofit employees can afford to live in the districts they serve;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communities across the state are facing an affordable housing crisis and there is a particularly acute need for affordable housing in the Puget Sound region. With historic investments in transit in the Puget Sound region, communities have the unprecedented and urgent opportunity to plan for, invest in, and build additional affordable housing, ensuring the region gets the most out of these investments in transit while meeting critical economic, environmental, and equity goals; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing can drive economic growth within neighborhoods if developed with a focus on services, jobs, infrastructure improvements, open spaces, and other elements that make housing vital and economically additive to nearby residents and the region as a whole.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends with this act to authorize the creation of housing benefit districts in order to produce more affordable low-income and middle-income housing to enable all members of the workforce to live in the district in which they serve, including members of racial and ethnic groups disproportionately experiencing adverse housing outcomes, to make sure that the transportation and housing investments in our state help to foster racial equity and rectify discriminatory practices.</p>

<p>A city planning pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040 may adopt a housing action plan as described in this subsection. The goal of any such housing plan must be to encourage construction of additional affordable and market rate housing in a greater variety of housing types and at prices that are accessible to a greater variety of incomes, including strategies aimed at the for-profit single-family home market. A housing action plan may utilize data compiled pursuant to RCW 36.70A.610. The housing action plan should:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Quantify existing and projected housing needs for all income levels, including extremely low-income households, with documentation of housing and household characteristics, and cost-burdened households;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop strategies to increase the supply of housing, and variety of housing types, needed to serve the housing needs identified in (a) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze population and employment trends, with documentation of projections;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider strategies to minimize displacement of low-income residents resulting from redevelopment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review and evaluate the current housing element adopted pursuant to RCW 36.70A.070, including an evaluation of success in attaining planned housing types and units, achievement of goals and policies, and implementation of the schedule of programs and actions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for participation and input from community members, community groups, local builders, local realtors, nonprofit housing advocates, and local religious groups; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a schedule of programs and actions to implement the recommendations of the housing action plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If adopted by April 1, 2023, ordinances, amendments to development regulations, and other nonproject actions taken by a city to implement the actions specified in subsection (1) of this section, with the exception of the action specified in subsection (1)(f) of this section, are not subject to administrative or judicial appeal under chapter 43.21C RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any action taken by a city prior to April 1, 2023, to amend their comprehensive plan, or adopt or amend ordinances or development regulations, solely to enact provisions under subsection (1) of this section is not subject to legal challenge under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In taking action under subsection (1) of this section, cities are encouraged to utilize strategies that increase residential building capacity in areas with frequent transit service and with the transportation and utility infrastructure that supports the additional residential building capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city that is planning to take at least two actions under subsection (1) of this section, and that action will occur between July 28, 2019, and April 1, 2021, is eligible to apply to the department for planning grant assistance of up to one hundred thousand dollars, subject to the availability of funds appropriated for that purpose. The department shall develop grant criteria to ensure that grant funds awarded are proportionate to the level of effort proposed by a city, and the potential increase in housing supply or regulatory streamlining that could be achieved. Funding may be provided in advance of, and to support, adoption of policies or ordinances consistent with this section. A city can request, and the department may award, more than one hundred thousand dollars for applications that demonstrate extraordinary potential to increase housing supply or regulatory streamlining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city seeking to develop a housing action plan under subsection (2) of this section <strong>or participating jurisdictions required to adopt a housing action plan under section 3(5) of this act are</strong> eligible to apply to the department for up to one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish grant award amounts under subsections (6) and (7) of this section based on the expected number of cities <strong>or participating jurisdictions</strong> that will seek grant assistance, to ensure that all cities <strong>and participating jurisdictions</strong> can receive some level of grant support. If funding capacity allows, the department may consider accepting and funding applications from cities with a population of less than twenty thousand if the actions proposed in the application will create a significant amount of housing capacity or regulatory streamlining and are consistent with the actions in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In implementing chapter 348, Laws of 2019, cities are encouraged to prioritize the creation of affordable, inclusive neighborhoods and to consider the risk of residential displacement, particularly in neighborhoods with communities at high risk of displacement.</p>
