<p>The commission may, upon complaint or upon its own motion, prescribe and authorize just and reasonable rates for the transportation of persons or property for any public service company subject to regulation by the commission as to rates and service, whenever and as often as it deems necessary or proper. The commission shall, before any hearing upon the complaint or motion, notify the complainants and the carrier concerned of the time and place of the hearing by giving at least ten days' written notice thereof, specifying that at the time and place designated a hearing will be held for the purpose of prescribing and authorizing the rates. The notice is sufficient to authorize the commission to inquire into and pass upon the matters designated in this section.</p>
<p>In exercising this power, the commission may use any standard, formula, method, or theory of valuation reasonably calculated to arrive at the objective of prescribing and authorizing just and reasonable rates.</p>
<p>In the exercise of this power, the commission may consider, in addition to other factors, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The effect of the rates upon movement of traffic by the carriers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public need for adequate transportation facilities, equipment, and service at the lowest level of charges consistent with the provision, maintenance, and renewal of the facilities, equipment, and service; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The carrier need for revenue of a level that under honest, efficient, and economical management is sufficient to cover the cost, including all operating expenses, depreciation accruals, rents, and taxes of every kind, of providing adequate transportation service, plus an amount equal to the percentage of that cost as is reasonably necessary for the provision, maintenance, and renewal of the transportation facilities or equipment and a reasonable profit to the carrier. The relation of carrier expenses to carrier revenues may be deemed the proper test of a reasonable profit.</p>

The attorney general shall thereupon begin such action or proceeding by petition to such superior court, alleging the violation complained of, and praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or injunction. It shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify a time, not exceeding twenty days after the service of the copy of the petition, within which the public service company complained of must answer the petition. In case of default in answer or after answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances in such manner as the court shall direct, without other or formal pleadings, and without respect to any technical requirement. Such persons or corporations as the court may deem necessary or proper to be joined as parties, in order to make its judgment, order or writ effective, may be joined as parties. The final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that the writ of mandamus or injunction, or both, issue as prayed for in the petition, or in such other modified form as the court may determine will afford appropriate relief. Appellate review of the final judgment may be sought in the same manner and with the same effect as review of judgments of the superior court in actions to review orders of the commission. All provisions of this chapter relating to the time of review, the manner of perfecting the same, the filing of briefs, hearings and supersedeas, shall apply to appeals to the supreme court or the court of appeals under the provisions of this section.</p>
