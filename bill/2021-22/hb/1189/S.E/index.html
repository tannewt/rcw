<li>
<p>A local government may designate an increment area under this chapter and use the tax allocation revenues to pay public improvement costs, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The local government must adopt an ordinance designating an increment area within its boundaries and describing the public improvements proposed to be paid for, or financed with, tax allocation revenues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government may not designate increment area boundaries such that the entirety of its territory falls within an increment area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government can create no more than three active increment areas at any given time and they may not physically overlap by including the same land in more than one increment area at any time;</p>

<li>
<p>The ordinance must set a sunset date for the increment area, which may be no more than 25 years after the adoption of the ordinance designating the increment area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ordinance must indicate whether the local government intends to issue bonds or other obligations, payable in whole or in part, from tax allocation revenues to finance the public improvement costs, and must estimate the maximum amount of obligations contemplated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ordinance must provide that the increment takes effect on June 1st following the adoption of the ordinance in (a) of this subsection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government must make a finding that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The public improvements proposed to be paid or financed with tax allocation revenues are expected to encourage private development within the increment area and to increase the assessed value of real property within the increment area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private development that is anticipated to occur within the increment area as a result of the proposed public improvements will be permitted consistent with the permitting jurisdiction's applicable zoning and development standards;</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In considering whether to designate an increment area, the legislative body of the local government must prepare a project analysis that shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A statement of objectives of the local government for the designated increment area;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An estimate of the job creation reasonably expected to result from the public improvements and the private development expected to occur in the increment area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of any impacts and any necessary mitigation to address the impacts identified on the following:</p>

<p>If the project analysis indicates that an increment area will impact at least 20 percent of the assessed value in a fire district, the local government must negotiate a mitigation plan with the fire district prior to implementing the increment area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government may reimburse the assessor and treasurer for their costs as provided in section 1(6)(e) of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the adoption of an ordinance authorizing creation of an increment area, the local government must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Hold at least two public briefings for the community solely on the tax increment project that include the description of the increment area, the public improvements proposed to be financed with the tax allocation revenues, and a detailed estimate of tax revenues for the participating local governments and taxing districts, including the amounts allocated to the increment public improvements. The briefings must be announced at least two weeks prior to the date being held, including publishing in legal newspaper of general circulation and posting information on the local government website and all local government social media sites; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit the project analysis to the office of the treasurer for review and consider any comments that the treasurer may provide upon completion of their review of the project analysis as provided under this subsection.

The local government that designated the increment area may agree to receive less than the full amount of this portion, as long as bond debt service, reserve, and other bond covenant requirements are satisfied, in which case the balance of these tax receipts shall be allocated to the taxing districts that imposed regular property taxes, or have regular property taxes imposed for them, in the increment area for collection that year in proportion to their regular tax levy rates for collection that year. The local government may request that the treasurer transfer this additional portion of the property taxes to its designated agent.

<ol>
<li>
<p>A local government may issue revenue bonds to fund revenue-generating public improvements, or portions of public improvements, that are located within an increment area and that it is authorized to provide or operate. Whenever revenue bonds are to be issued, the legislative authority of the local government shall create or have created a special fund or funds from which, along with any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140, the principal and interest on these revenue bonds shall exclusively be payable. The legislative authority of the local government may obligate the local government to set aside and pay into the special fund or funds a fixed proportion or a fixed amount of the revenues from the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds. This amount or proportion is a lien and charge against these revenues, subject only to operating and maintenance expenses. The local government shall have due regard for the cost of operation and maintenance of the public improvements that are funded by the revenue bonds, and shall not set aside into the special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues that in its judgment will be available over and above the cost of maintenance and operation and the amount or proportion, if any, of the revenue previously pledged. The local government may also provide that revenue bonds payable out of the same source or sources of revenue may later be issued on a parity with any revenue bonds being issued and sold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue bonds issued under this section are not an indebtedness of the local government issuing the bonds, and the interest and principal on the bonds shall only be payable from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The owner or bearer of a revenue bond or any interest coupon issued under this section shall not have any claim against the local government arising from the bond or coupon except for payment from the revenues lawfully pledged to meet the principal and interest requirements and any reserves created pursuant to RCW 39.44.140. The substance of the limitations included in this subsection shall be plainly printed, written, or engraved on each bond issued under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revenue bonds with a maturity in excess of 25 years shall not be issued under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of the local government shall by resolution determine for each revenue bond issue the amount, date, form, terms, conditions, denominations, maximum fixed or variable interest rate or rates, maturity or maturities, redemption rights, registration privileges, manner of execution, manner of sale, callable provisions, if any, and covenants including the refunding of existing revenue bonds. Facsimile signatures may be used on the bonds and any coupons. Refunding revenue bonds may be issued in the same manner as revenue bonds are issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority to issue revenue bonds under this section is supplementary and in addition to any authority otherwise existing. Nothing in this section limits a local government in the issuance of revenue bonds that are otherwise authorized by law for the construction of additions, betterments, or extensions of utilities within the increment area.</p>
