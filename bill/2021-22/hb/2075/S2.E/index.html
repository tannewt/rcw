<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that establishing minimum service requirements for the department of social and health services economic services administration's community services division is necessary due to the increase in call center wait times due to the closure of community services offices during the COVID-19 public health emergency, resulting in individuals being unable to access safety net programs administered by the department.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish minimum service expectations and requirements to ensure that eligible individuals receive needed services through the department's community services offices. The legislature further intends to prohibit the department's community services division from imposing punitive measures against individuals when they have attempted to contact or access the community services office, per requirements to apply for and maintain their benefits, and are unable to connect due to long wait times over the phone or due to closure of the community services offices, to the extent allowable under federal and state law.</p>
