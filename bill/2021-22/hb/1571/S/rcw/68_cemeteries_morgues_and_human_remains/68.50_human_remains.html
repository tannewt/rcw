<p>The missing person's dentist or dentists shall provide diagnostic quality copies of the missing person's dental records or original dental records to the sheriff, chief of police, county coroner or county medical examiner, or other law enforcement authority, when presented with the written consent from the missing person's family or next of kin or with a statement from the sheriff, chief of police, county coroner or county medical examiner, or other law enforcement authority that the missing person's family or next of kin could not be located in the exercise of due diligence or that the missing person's family or next of kin refuse to consent to the release of the missing person's dental records and there is reason to believe that the missing person's family or next of kin may have been involved in the missing person's disappearance.</p>
<p>As soon as possible after collecting the DNA samples, the sheriff, chief of police, or other law enforcement authority shall submit the DNA samples to the appropriate laboratory. Dental records shall be submitted as soon as possible to the Washington state patrol missing and unidentified persons unit.</p>
<p>The descriptive information from missing person's reports and dental data submitted to the Washington state patrol missing and unidentified persons unit shall be recorded and maintained by the Washington state patrol missing and unidentified persons unit in the applicable dedicated missing person's databases.</p>

If the county coroner or county medical examiner with the aid of the dental examination and other identifying findings is still unable to establish the identity of the body or human remains, he or she shall prepare and forward such dental examination records within thirty days of the date the body or human remains were found to the dental identification system of the state patrol identification and criminal history section on forms supplied by the state patrol for such purposes.</p>
<p>The dental identification system shall act as a repository or computer center or both with respect to such dental examination records.

<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the duty of every person who knows of the existence and location of skeletal human remains to notify the coroner and local law enforcement in the most expeditious manner possible, unless such person has good reason to believe that such notice has already been given. Any person knowing of the existence of skeletal human remains and not having good reason to believe that the coroner and local law enforcement has notice thereof and who fails to give notice to the coroner and local law enforcement, is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person engaged in ground disturbing activity and who encounters or discovers skeletal human remains in or on the ground shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Immediately cease any activity which may cause further disturbance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a reasonable effort to protect the area from further disturbance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report the presence and location of the remains to the coroner and local law enforcement in the most expeditious manner possible; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be held harmless from criminal and civil liability arising under the provisions of this section provided the following criteria are met:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The finding of the remains was based on inadvertent discovery;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirements of the subsection are otherwise met; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person is otherwise in compliance with applicable law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coroner must make a determination of whether the skeletal human remains are forensic or nonforensic within five business days of receiving notification of a finding of such human remains provided that there is sufficient evidence to make such a determination within that time period. The coroner will retain jurisdiction over forensic remains.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Upon determination that the remains are nonforensic, the coroner must notify the department of archaeology and historic preservation within two business days. The department will have jurisdiction over such remains until provenance of the remains is established. A determination that remains are nonforensic does not create a presumption of removal or nonremoval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving notice from a coroner of a finding of nonforensic skeletal human remains, the department must notify the appropriate local cemeteries, and all affected Indian tribes via certified mail to the head of the appropriate tribal government, and contact the appropriate tribal cultural resources staff within two business days of the finding. The determination of what are appropriate local cemeteries to be notified is at the discretion of the department. A notification to tribes of a finding of such nonforensic skeletal human remains does not create a presumption that the remains are Indian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state physical anthropologist must make an initial determination of whether nonforensic skeletal human remains are Indian or non-Indian to the extent possible based on the remains within two business days of notification of a finding of nonforensic remains. If the remains are determined to be Indian, the department must notify all affected Indian tribes via certified mail to the head of the appropriate tribal government within two business days and contact the appropriate tribal cultural resources staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The affected tribes have five business days to respond via telephone or writing to the department as to their interest in the remains.</p>

<li>
<p>Those federally recognized tribes with usual and accustomed areas in the jurisdiction where the remains were found;</p>

<li>
<p>Those federally recognized tribes that submit to the department maps that reflect the tribe's geographical area of cultural affiliation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other tribes with historical and cultural affiliation in the jurisdiction where the remains were found.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>A county coroner having jurisdiction over human remains pursuant to RCW 68.50.010 shall, upon knowledge that the remains are of an indigenous person, cooperate with law enforcement to attempt to identify and immediately contact family members and any affected tribes, tribal organizations, and communities prior to removal or disturbance of the remains, except as deemed necessary by the county coroner and law enforcement in the interest of safety or to preserve evidence for any ongoing criminal investigation. Efforts to contact family members and affected tribes, tribal organizations, and communities must include an attempt to facilitate contact through the regional liaison for missing and murdered indigenous persons pursuant to RCW 43.43.874 within 10 days of the county coroner having jurisdiction over the remains.</p>
