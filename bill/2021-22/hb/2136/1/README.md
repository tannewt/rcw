## Section 1
The legislature declares that the public policy of this state is to ensure vital, thriving communities for all Washingtonians. The legislature believes that no person's health or economic outcomes should be determined by their zip code, and it recognizes that the state is responsible for improving its engagement with people who live in rural areas. In order to improve the lives and livelihoods of people in rural areas, the legislature seeks to implement effective policies that recognize their unique needs and to include rural experiences and expertise in all aspects of policymaking and state government. Therefore, the legislature deems it necessary to create a commission to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
