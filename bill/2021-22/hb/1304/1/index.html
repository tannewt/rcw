The entities are authorized to convey or lease property to an authority or to contract for their joint use on terms fixed by agreement between the entity and the authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To fix rates, tolls, fares, and charges for the use of facilities and to establish various routes and classes of service.

</li>
<li>
<p>To acquire any existing public transportation facility by conveyance, sale, or lease. In any acquisition from a county, city, <strong>regional transit authority,</strong> or other political subdivision of the state, the authority will receive credit from the county or city or <strong>regional transit authority or</strong> other political subdivision for any federal assistance and state matching assistance used by the county or city <strong>or regional transit authority</strong> or other political subdivision in acquiring any portion of the public transportation facility. Upon acquisition, the authority must assume and observe all existing labor contracts relating to the public transportation facility and, to the extent necessary for operation of the public transportation facility, all of the employees of the public transportation facility whose duties are necessary to efficiently operate the public transportation facility must be appointed to comparable positions to those which they held at the time of the transfer, and no employee or retired or pensioned employee of the public transportation facility will be placed in any worse position with respect to pension seniority, wages, sick leave, vacation, or other benefits than he or she enjoyed as an employee of the public transportation facility prior to the acquisition. Furthermore, the authority must engage in collective bargaining with the duly appointed representatives of any employee labor organization having existing contracts with the acquired facility and may enter into labor contracts with the employee labor organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To  prepare, adopt, and carry out a comprehensive public <strong>grade-separated system plan and financing</strong> plan and to make other plans and studies and to perform programs as the authority deems necessary to implement and comply with those laws**. To the extent that new public grade-separated transportation corridors are planned, financing and system plans shall take into account (a) 30-year projected ridership, (b) the number of income-restricted affordable housing units within a 15-minute walking radius of stations, and (c) the number of transit-dependent households within a 15-minute walking radius of stations. On at least an annual basis throughout the planning process for each corridor, the authority shall consider and report the anticipated ridership, the number of income-restricted affordable housing units within a 15-minute walking radius of stations, and the number of transit-dependent households within a 15-minute walking radius of stations for each studied alternative within each corridor.

<li>
<p>To establish local improvement districts within the authority area to finance public <strong>grade-separated</strong> transportation facilities, to levy special assessments on property specially benefited by those facilities, and to issue local improvement bonds to be repaid by the collection of local improvement assessments. The method of establishment, levying, collection, enforcement, and all other matters relating to the local improvement districts, assessments, collection, and bonds are as provided in the statutes governing local improvement districts of cities and towns. The duties devolving upon the city treasurer in those statutes are imposed on the treasurer of the authority;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To exercise all other powers necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities, including without limitation the power to sue and be sued, to own, construct, purchase, lease, add to, and maintain any real and personal property or property rights necessary for the conduct of the affairs of the authority, to enter into contracts, and to employ the persons as the authority deems appropriate.

<p><strong>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, to the extent new public grade-separated transportation facilities are to be constructed by the authority, or using the funds collected by the authority, the authority may construct new public grade-separated transportation facilities for operation in entirely exclusive rights-of-way without grade crossings.

All insurance obtained for construction of authority projects with a total project cost exceeding $100,000,000 may be acquired by bid or by negotiation. In order to allow the authority flexibility to secure appropriate insurance by negotiation, the authority is exempt from RCW 48.30.270;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To dispose of any real or personal property acquired in connection with any authority function and that is no longer required for the purposes of the authority, in the same manner as provided for cities of the first class.
