<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the work of the state suicide prevention plan steering committee has produced a valuable, comprehensive suicide prevention plan. This plan finds that about one-half of mental health conditions appear by age 14 and identifies a need for preventing youth suicide risk farther upstream in a child's life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish a youth suicide review team to complement the work of the state suicide prevention plan steering committee by providing a focused investigation of the lives of youth who have died by suicide. The work of the review team shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide a more detailed picture of the lives of youth who have died by suicide in Washington to allow for more targeted intervention programs to reach youth earlier in their lives; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic or the state's response to the pandemic have impacted youth suicide rates.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze circumstances affecting the lives of the persons who have been reviewed according to (a) of this subsection to ascertain the existence of any common factors that may have contributed to the persons' suicide. The analysis may include:</p>
