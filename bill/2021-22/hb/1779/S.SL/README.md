2. The health care employer may select any smoke evacuation system that accounts for surgical techniques and procedures vital to patient safety and that takes into account employee safety.

3. The department shall ensure compliance with this section during any on-site inspection.

4. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Energy generating device" means a tool that performs a surgical function using heat, laser, electricity, or other form of energy.
