<li>
<p>The sentencing court may grant or deny a petition under this section. If the court grants a petition, the court shall resentence the offender in the same manner as if the offender had not previously been sentenced, except: The court may, in its discretion, order the firearm or deadly weapon enhancements to be served concurrently, regardless of the date of the offense; and the new sentence, if any, may not be greater than the initial sentence.</p>

<p>The changes to restrictions on partial confinement and earned early release for sentencing enhancements under sections 2, 4, and 5 of this act apply retroactively to offenders currently serving a sentence in any facility or institution either operated by the state or utilized under contract. Pursuant to RCW 9.94A.729, the department of corrections shall recalculate the earned release date for any qualifying offender, regardless of the date of sentencing or date of offense.

<p>The legislature declares that section 10 of this act does not create any liberty interest. The department of corrections' recalculations of earned release time do not create any expectation that the percentage of earned release time will be revised before the effective date of this section, and offenders have no reason to conclude that the maximum percentage of earned release time is an entitlement. The department of corrections has discretion to implement the retroactive changes to earned early release for qualifying offenders over a period of time not to exceed 12 months following the effective date of this section</p>
