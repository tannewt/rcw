<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis that has resulted in immense loss of human life and economic damage that will be felt for a very long time. Fur farms are not immune to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. During the summer and fall of 2020, farms in at least nine countries and at least four states in the United States, including Oregon, have been host to COVID-19 outbreaks at mink farms. As recently as December 2020, the virus that causes COVID-19 was discovered in mink samples from a farm in British Columbia, Canada, where workers on the farm tested positive for the virus. According to the Oregon department of agriculture, mink can transmit the disease to other animals. Investigations on mink farms around the world where the virus causing COVID-19 is present identified dogs and cats who tested positive for the virus. While there has not yet been evidence of a mink transmitting the virus to a human, these outbreaks have proven deadly to the animals and pose an unacceptable and unknown risk to the humans involved in the farming operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that it is necessary to take steps to stop the spread of the disease and intends to do so while minimizing overarching economic impacts and promote the health and safety of the people and animals of the state. The risk to public health is too high to continue this practice.</p>
