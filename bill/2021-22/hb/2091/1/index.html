<h2 id="section-1-3322">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3322">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Pharmaceutical warehouse distributors serve as the purveyors of opioids and other drugs to pharmacies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pharmaceutical warehouse distributor tax preferential rate was created in 1998 to level the playing field for Washington distributors. At that time, the constitutionally permissible limits of state tax authority required companies to have a physical presence within Washington in order to be subject to the business and occupation tax. This left Washington's distributors, who were required to pay the tax, at an economic disadvantage compared to out-of-state distributors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2018, this physical presence tax standard was discarded in the United States supreme court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018), and replaced with an economic presence test. Now, all pharmaceutical warehouse distributors are subject to the business and occupation tax, regardless of their physical location. The original rationale that led to the creation of this tax preference is no longer applicable, yet the tax preference remains in law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Washington state is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, with a staggering death toll;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington's opioid epidemic has ripped children from their parents and parents from their children;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The opioid epidemic has contributed to a dramatic increase in jail and prison populations and skyrocketing health care usage, all at public expense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opioid use disorder is a treatable brain disease from which people can and do recover;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovery from substance use disorder is predicated upon advancing an individual through the stages of change until the individual is willing to seek help. Building bridges of trust and hope and the use of evidence-based practices such as motivational interviewing are effective outreach tools to engage individuals in treatment. Outreach and engagement services are not reimbursable through medicaid or commercial insurance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment alone does not support long-term recovery from addiction. Recovery support services are a suite of critical services that help individuals in early recovery from addiction maintain their recovery during and after treatment. Lack of access to recovery support services is a leading driver of return to use. Recovery support services include recovery housing, education and employment supports, recovery community programs, legal support services, and family education. Recovery support services are generally not reimbursable through medicaid or commercial insurance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to close the obsolete pharmaceutical warehouse distributor tax preference and allocate the new revenue to fund the outreach and recovery support services that are essential to combating the opioid epidemic.</p>
</li>
