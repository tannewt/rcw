<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that having a conviction history or having been incarcerated are significant risk factors for housing instability and homelessness. Formerly incarcerated individuals are almost 10 times more likely to experience homelessness than the rest of the population, and much more likely to experience housing insecurity in general. The legislature recognizes that formerly incarcerated people and their families report being denied housing due to a criminal conviction. These barriers to housing have detrimental economic, emotional, and psychological impacts, including separating families when one member of a household is not permitted to live in the home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that criminal record screening for rental housing applicants and tenants has a disparate impact on people and communities of color due to racial inequities in the criminal legal system. These impacts are further compounded by racial bias in the tenant application and selection process. The legislature further finds that stable housing with appropriate supportive services is a key factor in preventing homelessness and reducing recidivism for individuals who were formerly incarcerated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to address housing discrimination against people impacted by the criminal legal system. Restricting the use of a conviction history as a reason to deny housing will reduce the harmful impacts that result in high rates of homelessness and housing insecurity among formerly incarcerated individuals.</p>

<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.18_residential_landlord-tenant_act.html">59.18</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.18_residential_landlord-tenant_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A landlord or any third-party entity may not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Advertise, publicize, or implement any policy or practice that automatically or categorically excludes from any rental housing all individuals with any arrest record or conviction record;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require disclosure, inquire about, or take an adverse action against a prospective tenant, tenant, or member of the tenant's household, based on any arrest record or conviction record, except as provided in (c) of this subsection and subject to the exclusions and legal requirements in subsection (7) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out an adverse action based on registry information of a prospective tenant, tenant, or member of the tenant's household, unless the landlord has a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for taking such action.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If a landlord takes an adverse action based on a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the landlord must provide written notice by email, mail, or in person of the adverse action to the prospective tenant or tenant and state the specific registry information that was the basis for the adverse action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a tenant screening report or comprehensive reusable tenant screening report is used by a landlord as part of the screening process, the landlord must provide the name and address of the consumer reporting agency and the prospective occupant's or tenant's rights to obtain a free copy of the tenant screening report in the event of a denial or other adverse action and to dispute the accuracy of information appearing in the tenant screening report. The prospective tenant or tenant must be provided at least five business days from the time of notice to dispute the accuracy and relevance of the tenant screening report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any refusal of tenancy under this subsection must be communicated to the tenant pursuant to RCW 59.18.257.</p>

<p>Any violation of this section by a landlord occurs in the course of trade or commerce as defined in the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW and is, for the purpose of applying that chapter, a matter affecting the public interest, is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business, and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a defense to an unlawful detainer action under chapter 59.12 RCW that the action to remove the tenant and recover possession of the premises is in violation of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not prohibit adverse housing decisions based upon other lawful factors within the landlord's knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not affect, modify, or limit the authority of a local government to adopt any rule, regulation, code, or ordinance to the extent that it is consistent with this section or offers greater protection than this section to a prospective tenant, tenant, or member of the tenant's household with respect to a landlord or third-party entity's use of an arrest record, conviction record, registry information, tenant screening report, or comprehensive reusable tenant screening report. This section also does not affect the authority of a local government to enforce, maintain, or amend any local rule, regulation, code, or ordinance enacted prior to January 1, 2022, related to a landlord or third-party entity's use of an arrest record, conviction record, registry information, tenant screening report, or comprehensive reusable tenant screening report. This section supersedes and preempts any local rule, regulation, code, or ordinance enacted on or after January 1, 2022, to the extent that it offers less protection than this section to a prospective tenant, tenant, or member of the tenant's household with respect to a landlord or third-party entity's use of an arrest record, conviction record, registry information, tenant screening report, or comprehensive reusable tenant screening report.</p>
</li>
