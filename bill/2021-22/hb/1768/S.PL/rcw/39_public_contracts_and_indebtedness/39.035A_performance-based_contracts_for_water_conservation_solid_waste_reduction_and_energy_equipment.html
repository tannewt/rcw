<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conserving energy and water in publicly owned buildings will have a beneficial effect on our overall supply of energy and water;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conserving energy and water in publicly owned buildings can result in cost savings for taxpayers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance-based energy contracts are a means by which municipalities can achieve energy and water conservation without capital outlay.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the legislature declares that it is the policy that a municipality may, after a competitive selection process, negotiate a performance-based energy contract with a firm that offers the best proposal.</p>
