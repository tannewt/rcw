<p>The city or county must permit accessory dwelling units in structures detached from the principal unit, must allow an accessory dwelling unit on any lot that meets the minimum lot size required for the principal unit, and must allow attached accessory dwelling units on any lot with a principal unit that is nonconforming solely because the lot is smaller than the minimum size, as long as the accessory dwelling unit would not increase nonconformity of the residential use with respect to building height, bulk, or lot coverage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county may not establish a maximum gross floor area requirement for accessory dwelling units that are less than 1,000 square feet or 60 percent of the principal unit, whichever is greater, or that exceeds 1,200 square feet;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A city or county may not require installation of a new or separate utility connection between an accessory dwelling unit and a utility unless unusual site conditions make it unavoidable, and if such connection is necessary, the connection fees of capacity charges must be consistent with water availability requirements, water system plans, small water system management plans, or established policies adopted by the water or sewer utility provider.</p>
