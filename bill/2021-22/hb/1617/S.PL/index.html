<p>In 2021, the state enacted House Bill No. 1016 to declare Juneteenth a state legal holiday. The legislature finds that there is ambiguity about whether Juneteenth is also a school holiday as a result of that act. The legislature intends to clarify that Juneteenth, like all other state legal holidays, is a school holiday on which school may not be taught.</p>
