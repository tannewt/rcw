<h2 id="section-1-1941">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1941">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act may be known and cited as the solitary confinement restriction act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1543">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1543">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that almost 600 adults continue to be held in solitary confinement in state correctional facilities. Solitary confinement has been shown to create devastating and lasting psychological impacts. Recent studies have shown that persons placed in solitary confinement have higher rates of medical concerns and a shorter life expectancy once released to the community. Studies have also shown that persons released to the community directly from solitary confinement have higher recidivism rates. Further, solitary confinement is disproportionately imposed upon Black, indigenous, and Hispanic people in state correctional facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that the use of solitary confinement in state correctional facilities should be restricted to ensure the safe and humane operation of these facilities, consistent with the state and federal Constitutions, the laws and public policies of this state, the mission of the correctional system, evolving medical knowledge, and international human rights standards that have recognized prolonged solitary confinement as torture. Solitary confinement should only be used when necessary, and should not be used against vulnerable populations or under conditions or for time periods that foster psychological trauma, psychiatric disorders, or serious, long-term damage to a person's brain. The standards established in this act apply to all incarcerated persons in the custody of the department of corrections.</p>

<p>An incarcerated person may be placed in solitary confinement for emergency purposes if: The incarcerated person has not been determined to be a vulnerable person; the superintendent of the correctional facility finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that the solitary confinement is necessary to reduce or protect against a substantial risk of immediate serious harm to the incarcerated person or another person, as evidenced by recent threats or conduct; and the superintendent of the correctional facility finds that a less restrictive intervention would insufficiently reduce this risk.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>INITIAL MEDICAL EVALUATION. A qualified medical provider shall conduct a personal and comprehensive medical and mental health examination of the incarcerated person prior to the incarcerated person being placed in solitary confinement under this section, unless there is reasonable cause to believe that such advance evaluation would create a substantial threat to security or safety, in which case the qualified medical provider shall conduct the evaluation within one hour of the person being placed in solitary confinement. The examination must include an assessment as to whether the incarcerated person is a vulnerable person and whether the person's age or circumstance makes them particularly vulnerable to the harm of isolation, such that the person should be considered a vulnerable person. A report of the evaluations must be immediately provided to the superintendent and the secretary.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>24-HOUR LIMIT.

</li>
<li>
<p>EXTENDED SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND ONGOING REVIEW. An incarcerated person may not be placed in extended solitary confinement for more than 15 consecutive days and for more than 45 cumulative days during a single fiscal year. For an incarcerated person in extended solitary confinement:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A qualified medical provider shall conduct a daily mental health and physical health status examination of the incarcerated person, in a confidential setting outside of the cell unless doing so would present a substantial threat to security or safety; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall provide the incarcerated person with timely, fair, and meaningful opportunities to contest the extended solitary confinement, including: An initial hearing within 72 hours of placement; the right to appear at the hearing; the right to request assistance at the hearing by a lay advisor or other person of the incarcerated person's choosing, including but not limited to other incarcerated individuals, outside advocates, or retained counsel; an independent hearing officer; a written statement of reasons for the decision made at the hearing; and a written statement on how to appeal a hearing determination.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>VULNERABLE PERSONS. If the incarcerated person is determined to be a vulnerable person during the initial examination under subsection (2) of this section or any status examination under subsection (3)(b) of this section, then the incarcerated person must be removed from solitary confinement and, if necessary, transferred to an appropriate residential treatment unit, medical unit, or other appropriate or specialized unit designated by the secretary. If the incarcerated person is identified as a vulnerable person due to having a mental disorder or developmental disability, as identified in RCW 72.09.015, the incarcerated person may also be screened by a qualified medical provider for transfer to the least restrictive appropriate short-term care or psychiatric facility designated by the department of social and health services pursuant to RCW 72.68.031.</p>

<p>An incarcerated person may be placed in solitary confinement for medical isolation if a qualified medical provider determines, based on a personal examination, that such confinement is necessary for medical reasons, which may include, but are not limited to, responding to a medical or mental health emergency or preventing the spread of a communicable disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any incarcerated person placed in solitary confinement under this section, an in-person clinical review must be conducted at least every six hours and as clinically indicated. An incarcerated person in solitary confinement under this section must be placed in a residential treatment unit, a close observation unit, or a medical unit, designated by the secretary.</p>

<li>
<p>An incarcerated person may not be placed in solitary confinement under this section for more than 15 consecutive days and for more than 45 cumulative days during a single fiscal year, unless a qualified medical provider determines that additional time is necessary: To prevent the spread of a communicable disease; to facilitate the provision of medical treatment to the incarcerated person; or for some other clearly stated medical purpose. If additional time is deemed necessary, the medical provider shall document specific reasons why the isolation is required and why less restrictive interventions are insufficient to accomplish the safety of incarcerated persons in the facility.

<p>An incarcerated person may be placed in solitary confinement if: The person is not a vulnerable person; the person has capacity to make an informed decision about placement in solitary confinement; there is reasonable cause to believe that solitary confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm; and the incarcerated person voluntarily requests such confinement conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incarcerated person may be placed in solitary confinement under this section only if the person provides informed, written consent. If an incarcerated person initiates an informed, written request for solitary confinement under this section, the correctional facility has the burden of establishing a basis for refusing the request. The department shall maintain a written record of any request provided under this section. Prior to declining a request or removing an incarcerated person who previously requested solitary confinement under this section, the department shall provide the incarcerated person with a timely, fair, and meaningful opportunity to contest the decision. An incarcerated person in solitary confinement under this section may revoke his or her request to such confinement conditions by providing informed, written notice, in which case the incarcerated person must be transferred to a less restrictive intervention or other appropriate setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LESS RESTRICTIVE INTERVENTION. The department shall make a less restrictive intervention available to any incarcerated person requesting solitary confinement who meets the standard under subsection (1) of this section, which may include provision of accommodations in the general population, a transfer to the general population of another institution or to a unit designated for incarcerated persons who face similar threats, or other specialized housing, as appropriate. A transfer to an out-of-state facility is not a less restrictive intervention under this section unless such a transfer is requested by the incarcerated person. The department shall notify the incarcerated person of the available less restrictive intervention when receiving any request under subsection (1) of this section and shall formulate an individualized intervention plan that addresses the support or services the person may need to move to a less restrictive intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who has requested solitary confinement under this section must be assessed by a qualified medical provider every 90 days. If the qualified medical provider finds that continued placement in solitary confinement would be detrimental to the health or well-being of the incarcerated person, the incarcerated person must be transferred to a less restrictive intervention.</p>
