<h2 id="7209010---legislative-intent-57">72.09.010 - Legislative intent. <a class="header-anchor" href="#7209010---legislative-intent-57">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish a comprehensive system of corrections for convicted law violators within the state of Washington to accomplish the following objectives.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The system should ensure the public safety. The system should be designed and managed to provide the maximum feasible safety for the persons and property of the general public, the staff, and the inmates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system should punish the offender for violating the laws of the state of Washington. This punishment should generally be limited to the denial of liberty of the offender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system should positively impact offenders by stressing personal responsibility and accountability and by discouraging recidivism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system should treat all offenders fairly and equitably without regard to race, religion, sex, national origin, residence, or social condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system, as much as possible, should reflect the values of the community including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Avoiding idleness. Idleness is not only wasteful but destructive to the individual and to the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adoption of the work ethic. It is the community expectation that all individuals should work and through their efforts benefit both themselves and the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing opportunities for self improvement. All individuals should have opportunities to grow and expand their skills and abilities so as to fulfill their role in the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linking the receipt or denial of privileges to responsible behavior and accomplishments. The individual who works to improve himself or herself and the community should be rewarded for these efforts. As a corollary, there should be no rewards for no effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing in the obligations of the community. All citizens, the public and inmates alike, have a personal and fiscal obligation in the corrections system. All communities must share in the responsibility of the corrections system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system should provide for prudent management of resources. The avoidance of unnecessary or inefficient public expenditures on the part of offenders and the department is essential. Offenders must be accountable to the department, and the department to the public and the legislature. The human and fiscal resources of the community are limited. The management and use of these resources can be enhanced by wise investment, productive programs, the reduction of duplication and waste, and the joining together of all involved parties in a common endeavor. Since most offenders return to the community, it is wise for the state and the communities to make an investment in effective rehabilitation programs for offenders and the wise use of resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system should provide for restitution. Those who have damaged others, persons or property, have a responsibility to make restitution for these damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system should be accountable to the citizens of the state. In return, the individual citizens and local units of government must meet their responsibilities to make the corrections system effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system should meet those national standards which the state determines to be appropriate.</p>
</li>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature to vest in the department the power to provide for a comprehensive inmate work program and to remove statutory and other restrictions which have limited work programs in the past. It is also the intent of the legislature to ensure that the department, in developing and selecting correctional industries work programs, does not encourage the development of, or provide for selection of or contracting for, or the significant expansion of, any new or existing class I correctional industries work programs that unfairly compete with Washington businesses. The legislature intends that the requirements relating to fair competition in the correctional industries work programs be liberally construed by the department to protect Washington businesses from unfair competition. For purposes of establishing such a comprehensive program, the legislature recommends that the department consider adopting any or all, or any variation of, the following classes of work programs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>CLASS I: FREE VENTURE INDUSTRIES.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The employer model industries in this class shall be operated and managed in total or in part by any profit or nonprofit organization pursuant to an agreement between the organization and the department. The organization shall produce goods or services for sale to both the public and private sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The customer model industries in this class shall be operated and managed by the department to provide Washington state manufacturers or businesses with products or services currently produced or provided by out-of-state or foreign suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall review these proposed industries, including any potential new class I industries work program or the significant expansion of an existing class I industries work program, before the department contracts to provide such products or services. The review shall include the analysis required under RCW 72.09.115 to determine if the proposed correctional industries work program will compete with any Washington business. An agreement for a new class I correctional industries work program, or an agreement for a significant expansion of an existing class I correctional industries work program, that unfairly competes with any Washington business is prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall supply appropriate security and custody services without charge to the participating firms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inmates who work in free venture industries shall do so at their own choice. They shall be paid a wage comparable to the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located, as determined by the director of correctional industries. If the director cannot reasonably determine the comparable wage, then the pay shall not be less than the federal minimum wage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An inmate who is employed in the class I program of correctional industries shall not be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to any of the provisions of Title 50 RCW until released on parole or discharged.</p>

<p>The department must prepare a threshold analysis for any proposed new class I correctional industries work program or the significant expansion of an existing class I correctional industries work program before the department enters into an agreement to provide such products or services. The analysis must state whether the proposed new or expanded program will impact any Washington business and must be based on information sufficient to evaluate the impact on Washington business.</p>

The business impact analysis must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A detailed statement identifying the scope and types of impacts caused by the proposed new or expanded correctional industries work program on Washington businesses; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A detailed statement of the business costs of the proposed correctional industries work program compared to the business costs of the Washington businesses that may be impacted by the proposed class I correctional industries work program. Business costs of the proposed correctional industries work program include rent, water, sewer, electricity, disposal, labor costs, and any other quantifiable expense unique to operating in a prison. Business costs of the impacted Washington business include rent, water, sewer, electricity, disposal, property taxes, and labor costs including employee taxes, unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation.</p>

<p>The completed threshold analysis and any completed business impact analysis with all supporting documents must be shared in a meaningful and timely manner with local chambers of commerce, trade or business associations, local and state labor union organizations, and government entities before a finding required under subsection (4) of this section is made on the proposed new or expanded class I correctional industries work program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a business impact analysis is completed, the department must conduct a public hearing to take public testimony on the business impact analysis. The department must, at a minimum, establish a publicly accessible website containing information reasonably calculated to provide notice to each Washington business assigned the same three-digit standard industrial classification code, or the corresponding North American industry classification system code, as the organization seeking the class I correctional industries work program agreement of the date, time, and place of the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be posted at least thirty days prior to the hearing.</p>

<p>Following the public hearing, the department shall adopt a finding that the proposed new or expanded class I correctional industries work program: (a) Will not compete with any Washington business; (b) will not compete unfairly with any Washington business; or (c) will compete unfairly with any Washington business and is therefore prohibited under chapter 167, Laws of 2004.</p>

<p>The reentry community services program is established to provide intensive services to persons identified under this subsection and to thereby promote successful reentry, public safety, and recovery. The secretary shall identify persons in confinement or partial confinement who: (a) Are reasonably believed to present a danger to themselves or others if released to the community without supportive services; and (b) have a mental disorder. In evaluating these criteria, the secretary shall consider behavior known to the department and factors, based on research, that are linked to risk of dangerousness for persons with mental illnesses within the criminal justice system and shall include consideration of the person's history of substance use disorder or abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to release of a person identified under this section, a team consisting of representatives of the department of corrections, the health care authority, and, as necessary, the indeterminate sentence review board, divisions or administrations within the department of social and health services, specifically including the division of developmental disabilities, the appropriate managed care organization or behavioral health administrative services organization, and reentry community services providers, as appropriate, shall develop a plan, as determined necessary by the team, for delivery of treatment and support services to the person upon release. In developing the plan, the person shall be offered assistance in executing a mental health advance directive under chapter 71.32 RCW, after being fully informed of the benefits, scope, and purposes of such directive. The team may include a school district representative for persons under the age of 21. The team shall consult with the person's counsel, if any, and, as appropriate, the person's family and community. The team shall notify the crime victim/witness program, which shall provide notice to all people registered to receive notice under RCW 72.09.712 of the proposed release plan developed by the team. Victims, witnesses, and other interested people notified by the department may provide information and comments to the department on potential safety risk to specific individuals or classes of individuals posed by the specific person. The team may recommend: (a) That the person be evaluated by a designated crisis responder, as defined in chapter 71.05 RCW; (b) department-supervised community treatment; or (c) voluntary community mental health or substance use disorder or abuse treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to release of a person identified under this section, the team shall determine whether or not an evaluation by a designated crisis responder is needed. If an evaluation is recommended, the supporting documentation shall be immediately forwarded to the appropriate designated crisis responder. The supporting documentation shall include the person's criminal history, history of judicially required or administratively ordered involuntary antipsychotic medication while in confinement, and any known history of involuntary civil commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an evaluation by a designated crisis responder is recommended by the team, such evaluation shall occur not more than ten days, nor less than five days, prior to release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second evaluation by a designated crisis responder shall occur on the day of release if requested by the team, based upon new information or a change in the person's mental condition, and the initial evaluation did not result in an emergency detention or a summons under chapter 71.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the designated crisis responder determines an emergency detention under chapter 71.05 RCW is necessary, the department shall release the person only to a state hospital or to a consenting evaluation and treatment facility or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility. The department shall arrange transportation of the person to the hospital or facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the designated crisis responder believes that a less restrictive alternative treatment is appropriate, he or she shall seek a summons, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 71.05 RCW, to require the person to appear at an evaluation and treatment facility or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility. If a summons is issued, the person shall remain within the corrections facility until completion of his or her term of confinement and be transported, by corrections personnel on the day of completion, directly to the identified facility.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that high crime rates and a heightened sense of vulnerability have led to increased public pressure on criminal justice officials to increase offender punishment and remove the most dangerous criminals from the streets. As a result, there is unprecedented growth in the corrections populations and overcrowding of prisons and local jails. Skyrocketing costs and high rates of recidivism have become issues of major public concern. Attention must be directed towards implementing a long-range corrections strategy that focuses on inmate responsibility through intensive work ethic training.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that many offenders lack basic life skills and have been largely unaffected by traditional correctional philosophies and programs. In addition, many first-time offenders who enter the prison system learn more about how to be criminals than the important qualities, values, and skills needed to successfully adapt to a life without crime.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that opportunities for offenders to improve themselves are extremely limited and there has not been adequate emphasis on alternatives to total confinement for nonviolent offenders.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that the explosion of drug crimes since the inception of the sentencing reform act and the response of the criminal justice system have resulted in a much higher proportion of substance abuse-affected offenders in the state's prisons and jails. The needs of this population differ from those of other offenders and present a great challenge to the system. The problems are exacerbated by the shortage of drug treatment and counseling programs both in and outside of prisons.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that the concept of a work ethic camp that requires the offender to complete an appropriate and balanced combination of highly structured and goal-oriented work programs such as correctional industries based work camps and/or class I and class II work projects, drug rehabilitation, and intensive life management work ethic training, can successfully reduce offender recidivism and lower the overall cost of incarceration.</p>
<p>It is the purpose and intent of RCW 72.09.400 through * 72.09.420, 9.94A.690, and **section 5, chapter 338, Laws of 1993 to implement a regimented work ethic camp that is designed to directly address the high rate of recidivism, reduce upwardly spiraling prison costs, preserve scarce and high cost prison space for the most dangerous offenders, and provide judges with a tough and sound alternative to traditional incarceration without compromising public safety.</p>

<p>The department of corrections shall establish one work ethic camp. The secretary shall locate the work ethic camp within an already existing department compound or facility, or in a facility that is scheduled to come on line within the initial implementation date outlined in this section. The facility selected for the camp shall appropriately accommodate the logistical and cost-effective objectives contained in RCW 72.09.400 through * 72.09.420, 9.94A.690, and **section 5, chapter 338, Laws of 1993. The department shall be ready to assign inmates to the camp one hundred twenty days after July 1, 1993. The department shall establish the work ethic camp program cycle to last from one hundred twenty to one hundred eighty days. The department shall develop all aspects of the work ethic camp program including, but not limited to, program standards, conduct standards, educational components including preparation for a high school equivalency certificate as described in RCW 28B.50.536, offender incentives, drug rehabilitation program parameters, individual and team work goals, techniques for improving the offender's self-esteem, citizenship skills for successful living in the community, measures to hold the offender accountable for his or her behavior, and the successful completion of the work ethic camp program granted to the offender based on successful attendance, participation, and performance as defined by the secretary. The work ethic camp shall be designed and implemented so that offenders are continually engaged in meaningful activities and unstructured time is kept to a minimum. In addition, the department is encouraged to explore the integration and overlay of a military style approach to the work ethic camp.</p>

<p>In order to maximize the cost-efficient collection of unpaid offender debt existing after the period of an offender's incarceration, the department is authorized to use the following nonexclusive options: (a) Use the collection services available through the department of enterprise services, or (b) notwithstanding any provision of chapter 41.06 RCW, contract with collection agencies for collection of the debts. The costs for enterprise services or collection agency services shall be paid by the debtor. Any contract with a collection agency shall only be awarded after competitive bidding. Factors the department shall consider in awarding a collection contract include but are not limited to a collection agency's history and reputation in the community; and the agency's access to a local database that may increase the efficiency of its collections. The servicing of an unpaid obligation to the department does not constitute assignment of a debt, and no contract with a collection agency may remove the department's control over unpaid obligations owed to the department.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In addition to the policies set forth in this section, the department shall consider the following factors in establishing criteria for assessing the inclusion of education and work programs in an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan and in placing incarcerated individuals in education and work programs:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An incarcerated individual's release date and custody level. An incarcerated individual shall not be precluded from participating in an education or work program solely on the basis of his or her release date, except that incarcerated individuals with a release date of more than one hundred twenty months in the future shall not comprise more than ten percent of incarcerated individuals participating in a new class I correctional industry not in existence on June 10, 2004;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incarcerated individual's education history and basic academic skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incarcerated individual's work history and vocational or work skills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incarcerated individual's economic circumstances, including but not limited to an incarcerated individual's family support obligations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where applicable, an incarcerated individual's prior performance in department-approved education or work programs;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish, and periodically review, incarcerated individual behavior standards and program outcomes for all education and work programs. Incarcerated individuals shall be notified of applicable behavior standards and program goals prior to placement in an education or work program and shall be removed from the education or work program if they consistently fail to meet the standards or outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education or work programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish, by rule, a process for identifying and assessing incarcerated individuals with learning disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, and other cognitive impairments to determine whether the person requires accommodations in order to effectively participate in educational programming, including general educational development tests and postsecondary education. The department shall establish a process to provide such accommodations to eligible incarcerated individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish, and periodically review, goals for expanding access to postsecondary degree and certificate education programs and program completion for all incarcerated individuals, including persons of color. The department may contract and partner with any accredited educational program sponsored by a nonprofit entity, community-based postsecondary education program, or institution with historical evidence of providing education programs to people of color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish, by rule, objective medical standards to determine when an incarcerated individual is physically or mentally unable to participate in available education or work programs. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is permanently unable to participate in any available education or work program due to a health condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement under subsection (2) of this section. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is temporarily unable to participate in an education or work program due to a medical condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement of subsection (2) of this section for the period of time he or she is temporarily disabled. The department shall periodically review the medical condition of all incarcerated individuals with temporary disabilities to ensure the earliest possible entry or reentry by incarcerated individuals into available programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish policies requiring an incarcerated individual to pay all or a portion of the costs and tuition for any vocational training or postsecondary education program if the incarcerated individual previously abandoned coursework related to postsecondary degree or certificate education or vocational training without excuse as defined in rule by the department. Department policies shall include a formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay. The formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary costs. The formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any program on behalf of an incarcerated individual under this subsection. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, an incarcerated individual sentenced to death under chapter 10.95 RCW or subject to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Shall not be required to participate in education programming except as may be necessary for the maintenance of discipline and security;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May not participate in a postsecondary degree education program offered by the department or its contracted providers, unless the incarcerated individual's participation in the program is paid for by a third party or by the individual;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May participate in prevocational or vocational training that may be necessary to participate in a work program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this chapter relating to incarcerated individual financial responsibility for programming.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an incarcerated individual has participated in postsecondary education programs, the department shall provide the incarcerated individual with a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts, at no cost to the individual, upon the incarcerated individual's release or transfer to a different facility. Upon the incarcerated individual's completion of a postsecondary education program, the department shall provide to the incarcerated individual, at no cost to the individual, a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts. This requirement applies regardless of whether the incarcerated individual became ineligible to participate in or abandoned a postsecondary education program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;third party&quot; includes a nonprofit entity or community-based postsecondary education program that partners with the department to provide accredited postsecondary education degree and certificate programs at state correctional facilities.</p>

An incarcerated person may be placed in solitary confinement for emergency purposes if: The incarcerated person has not been determined to be a vulnerable person; the superintendent of the correctional facility finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that the solitary confinement is necessary to reduce or protect against a substantial risk of immediate serious harm to the incarcerated person or another person, as evidenced by recent threats or conduct; and the superintendent of the correctional facility finds that a less restrictive intervention would insufficiently reduce this risk.</p>
<ol start="2">

<p>INITIAL MEDICAL EVALUATION. A qualified medical provider shall conduct a personal and comprehensive medical and mental health examination of the incarcerated person prior to the incarcerated person being placed in solitary confinement under this section, unless there is reasonable cause to believe that such advance evaluation would create a substantial threat to security or safety, in which case the qualified medical provider shall conduct the evaluation within one hour of the person being placed in solitary confinement. The examination must include an assessment as to whether the incarcerated person is a vulnerable person.

</li>
<li>
<p>For any incarcerated person placed in solitary confinement under this section, an in-person clinical review must be conducted at least every six hours and as clinically indicated.

A transfer to an out-of-state facility is not a less restrictive intervention under this section unless such a transfer is requested by the incarcerated person. The department shall notify the incarcerated person of the available less restrictive intervention when receiving any request under subsection (1) of this section and shall formulate an individualized intervention plan that addresses the support or services the person may need to move to a less restrictive intervention.</p>
