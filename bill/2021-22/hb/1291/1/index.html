<h2 id="section-1-3162">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3162">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Chronic respiratory conditions, such as asthma, can lead to hospitalization and even death when poorly controlled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prevalence of asthma in Washington state is among the highest in the nation:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Between eight and 11 percent of children in middle school, or about 120,000 children in Washington, have asthma; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Youth of color and low-income individuals have a higher prevalence of asthma;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals with chronic respiratory conditions, such as asthma, may be at an increased risk for severe symptoms from the virus that causes COVID-19;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dust mites, mold, and pests in the home can exacerbate symptoms impacting respiratory health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other environmental factors, such as smoke from wildfires in Washington state and neighboring areas, can exacerbate symptoms impacting respiratory health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High efficiency particulate air filters and other home environment supplies are becoming increasingly vital tools for improving and maintaining air quality amidst emergent environmental threats, such as regional wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington researchers have found that home health interventions, including education from a community health worker and supplies to remediate triggers, are successful;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children whose families participated in home health intervention programs had reduced emergency care utilization and more symptom-free days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reduction in emergency care utilization to treat exacerbated respiratory conditions, such as asthma attacks triggered by environmental factors, may help prevent the overburdening of medical facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home health intervention programs can reduce costly emergency room visits for the state because public funds pay for about 60 percent of Washington's asthma-related hospitalization costs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research shows that home visit programs have a $1.90 return on investment for every dollar spent.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Establish a program for recruiting, training, supervising, and determining the competence of community respiratory health workers;</p>

<h2 id="section-6-1002">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-1002">¶</a></h2>
<p>In establishing a system for accepting referrals on behalf of potential program clients, the department shall allow for referrals to come from primary care providers and emergency departments. The department may examine various methods for accepting referrals from emergency departments, primary care providers, and other health care providers, such as allergists and pulmonologists, including direct referrals and reporting through existing databases related to notifiable conditions or emergency department visits. The department may examine options to authorize other entities to refer potential clients to the program, such as referrals from managed care organizations based on utilization data.
