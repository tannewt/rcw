<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that dependency proceedings determine many critical aspects of a child's future, including whether the child may remain at home with their family, whether and how often the child sees their parents and siblings if they do not remain with their family, where the child attends school, and how long the child remains in state care. Children and youth, regardless of age, have many legal rights at stake in these proceedings, including a right to maintain family relationships, a right to freedom from harm, and a right to reasonable safety. Standards-based representation by a well-qualified attorney can be invaluable in protecting and advancing the child's legal rights and, where articulable, stated interests. Attorneys can advise and assist children and youth in presenting their experiences and position to the court, improving the court's comprehensive decision making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that appointing attorneys to provide standards-based legal representation for children and youth in dependency proceedings has been shown to result in more timely permanency for children and youth, increased school and placement stability, and increased contact with parents and siblings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the current system for child legal representation is inadequate and has resulted in a patchwork system that varies by county leading to many children and youth not having equal access to the court process. This is particularly true when significant events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, result in sudden changes to court rules and procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that Black and Indigenous children and youth and other youth of color are much more likely to be removed from their parents' care, placed into foster care, and remain in the child welfare system longer than White children. Systemic racism contributes to this overrepresentation and to the lack of meaningful access to the court process for children and their families. It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that any expansion of legal representation actively combat this disproportionality.</p>

<p>If the court maintains the dependency proceeding of a youth pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the youth is eligible to receive extended foster care services pursuant to RCW 74.13.031, subject to the youth's continuing eligibility and agreement to participate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dependent youth receiving extended foster care services is a party to the dependency proceeding. The youth's parent or guardian must be dismissed from the dependency proceeding when the youth reaches the age of eighteen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall dismiss the dependency proceeding for any youth who is a dependent and who, at the age of eighteen years, does not meet any of the criteria described in subsection (1)(a) through (e) of this section or does not agree to participate in the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall order a youth participating in extended foster care services to be under the placement and care authority of the department, subject to the youth's continuing agreement to participate in extended foster care services. The department may establish foster care rates appropriate to the needs of the youth participating in extended foster care services. The department's placement and care authority over a youth receiving extended foster care services is solely for the purpose of providing services and does not create a legal responsibility for the actions of the youth receiving extended foster care services.</p>
