<p>The legislature finds that in order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in RCW 70A.45.020, the state must require performance standards for existing buildings.</p>
<p>In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the need and potential for updating the state's building stock, including the &quot;split incentive issue&quot; in which tenants are responsible for energy costs and building owners are responsible for choices about energy systems and building maintenance, more robust benchmarking and reporting for building performance, operations, and maintenance is needed. While the state has adopted comprehensive reporting requirements for larger buildings, it currently lacks similar requirements for smaller buildings. It is the intent of the legislature to extend existing building benchmarking, energy management, and operations and maintenance planning requirements to smaller commercial and multifamily residential buildings in order to assess the needs and opportunities for job creation and incentives and environmental and public health improvements.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that in order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in the energy sectors of the economy, more resources must be directed toward achieving decarbonization of building heating and cooling loads, while continuing to relieve energy burdens that exist in overburdened communities.</p>

<p>By December 1, 2023, the department must adopt by rule a state energy management and benchmarking requirement for tier 2 covered buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In establishing the requirements under (a) of this subsection, the department must adopt requirements for building owner implementation consistent with the standard established pursuant to RCW 19.27A.210(1) and limited to energy management planning, operations and maintenance planning, and energy use analysis through benchmarking and associated reporting and administrative procedures.  Administrative procedures must include exemptions for financial hardship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must provide a customer support program to building owners including, but not limited to, outreach and informational materials that connect building owners to utility resources, periodic training, phone and email support, and other technical assistance. The customer support program must include enhanced technical support, such as benchmarking assistance and assistance in developing energy management and operations and maintenance plans, for covered buildings whose owners typically do not employ dedicated building managers including, but not limited to, multifamily housing, child care facilities, and houses of worship. The department shall consider underresourced buildings with a high energy use per square foot, buildings in rural communities, buildings whose tenants are primarily small businesses, and those located in high-risk communities according to the department of health's environmental health disparities map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish an incentive program. Incentive assistance must be directed to supplement the cost to the building owner or tenant for these activities, less utility incentives and annual utility savings resulting from these requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incentive assistance funds provided for upgrading multifamily buildings must include a requirement that tenants' rent not be raised at a rate that exceeds inflation for a period of four years following receipt of incentive assistance funds.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The department is authorized to adopt rules related to the imposition of an administrative penalty not to exceed 30 cents per square foot upon a building owner for failing to submit documentation demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this section, including penalties for increasing rent above the rate of inflation for multifamily leased space that receive incentive assistance funds to comply with this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative penalties collected under this section must be deposited into the low-income weatherization and structural rehabilitation assistance account created in RCW 70A.35.030 and reinvested into the program, where feasible, to support compliance with the standard.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2025, the department must provide the owners of tier 2 covered buildings with notification of the requirements the department has adopted pursuant to this section that apply to tier 2 covered buildings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The owner of a tier 2 covered building must report the building owner's compliance with the requirements adopted by the department to the department in accordance with the schedule established under subsection (4) of this section and every five years thereafter. For each reporting date, the building owner must submit documentation to demonstrate that the building owner has developed and implemented the procedures adopted by the department by rule, limited to energy management planning, operations and maintenance planning, and energy use analysis through benchmarking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2027, tier 2 covered building owners must submit reports to the department as required by the rules adopted in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2029, the department must evaluate benchmarking data to determine energy use and greenhouse gas emissions averages by building type. The department must submit a report to the legislature and the governor by October 1, 2029, with recommendations for cost-effective building performance standards for tier 2 covered buildings. The report must contain information on estimated costs to building owners to implement the standard and anticipated implementation challenges. The department is authorized to adopt rules for inclusion of tier 2 covered buildings in the state energy performance standard, including greenhouse gas emissions, created in RCW 19.27A.210, beginning in 2030. In adopting performance standards, the department shall consider age of the building in setting targets for tier 2 buildings. The department is authorized to adopt performance standards for multifamily residential buildings on a longer timeline schedule than other tier 2 buildings. By December 31, 2030, the department shall adopt rules for performance standards for tier 2 buildings. The rules may not take effect before the end of the 2031 regular legislative session.</p>
