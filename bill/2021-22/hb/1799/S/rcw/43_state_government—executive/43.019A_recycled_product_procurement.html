<ol>
<li>
<p>When planning government-funded projects or soliciting and reviewing bids for such projects, all state agencies and local governments shall consider whether compost products can be utilized in the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If compost products can be utilized in the project, the state agency or local government must use compost products, except as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A state agency or local government is not required to use compost products if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Compost products are not available within a reasonable period of time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compost products that are available do not comply with existing purchasing standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compost products that are available do not comply with federal or state health, quality, and safety standards; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compost purchase prices are not reasonable or competitive; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A state agency is also not required to use compost products in a project if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The total cost of using compost is financially prohibitive;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of compost will have detrimental impacts on the physical characteristics and nutrient condition of the soil as it is used for a specific crop;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project consists of growing trees in a greenhouse setting, including seed orchard greenhouses; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The compost products that are available have not been certified as being free of crop-specific pests and pathogens, including pests and pathogens that could result in the denial of phytosanitary permits for shipping seedlings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before the transportation or application of compost products under this section, composting facilities, state agencies, and local governments must ensure compliance with department of agriculture pest control regulations provided in chapter 16-470 WAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State agencies and local governments are encouraged to give priority to purchasing compost products from companies that produce compost products locally, are certified by a nationally recognized organization, and produce compost products that are derived from municipal solid waste compost programs and meet quality standards adopted by rule by the department of ecology.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Each local government that provides a residential composting service is encouraged to enter into a purchasing agreement with its compost processor to buy back finished compost products for use in government projects or on government land. The local government is encouraged to purchase an amount of finished compost product that is equal to or greater than fifty percent of the amount of organic residuals it delivered to the compost processor. Local governments may enter into collective purchasing agreements if doing so is more cost-effective or efficient. The compost processor should offer a purchase price that is reasonable and competitive for the specific market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When purchasing compost products for use in government projects or on government-owned land, local governments are encouraged to purchase compost with at least eight percent food waste, or an amount of food waste that is commensurate with that in the local jurisdiction's curbside collection program.</p>

<p>By December 31, 2024, and each December 31st of even-numbered years thereafter, each local government that adopts an ordinance under subsection (1) of this section must submit a report covering the previous year's compost procurement activities to the Washington center for sustainable food management created in chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 901 of this act) that contains the following information:</p>
