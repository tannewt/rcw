<li>
<p>The legislature finds that landfills are a significant source of emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Among other economic and environmental benefits, the diversion of organic materials to productive uses will reduce methane emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to reduce methane emissions associated with organic materials, the legislature finds that it will be beneficial to improve a variety of aspects of how organic materials are reduced, managed, incentivized, and regulated under state law. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support the diversion of organic materials from landfills through a variety of interventions to support productive uses of organic material wastes, including by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Requiring some local governments to begin providing separated organic material collection services within their jurisdictions in order to increase volumes of organic materials collected and delivered to composting and other organic material management facilities and reduce the volumes of organic materials collected in conjunction with other solid waste and delivered to landfills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring local governments to consider state organic material management goals and requirements in the development of their local solid waste plans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring some businesses to manage their organic material wastes in a manner that does not involve landfilling them, in order to address one significant source of organic materials that currently frequently end up in landfills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing legal liability risk barriers to the donation of edible food in order to encourage the recovery of foods that might otherwise be landfilled;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing the Washington center for sustainable food management within the department of ecology in order to coordinate and improve statewide food waste reduction and diversion efforts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing various new funding and financial incentives intended to increase composting and other forms of productive organic materials management, helping to make the responsible management of organic materials more cost-competitive with landfilling of organic material wastes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitating the siting of organic material management facilities in order to ensure that adequate capacity exists to process organic materials at the volumes necessary to achieve state organic material diversion goals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring local governments to procure more of the compost and finished products created from their organic material wastes in order to support the economic viability of processes to turn organic materials into finished products, and increasing the likelihood that composting and other responsible organic material management options are economically viable; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amending standards related to the labeling of plastic and compostable products in order to reduce contamination of the waste streams handled by compost and organic material management facilities and improve the economic viability of those responsible organic material management options.</p>

<p>The department of ecology must work with the Washington association of county solid waste managers, the association of Washington cities, and other stakeholders to contract with a third-party consultant to conduct a study of the adequacy of local government solid waste management funding. The study must consider cities and counties and their differences, the funding needs to implement the solid waste core services model developed by the Washington association of county solid waste managers, and the impacts on solid waste funding resources utilized by cities and counties considering potential statewide solid waste management policy changes and develop options and recommendations for how to provide funding for solid waste programs in the future if major policy changes are enacted. The study must include a review and update of current funding types and levels available, jurisdictional types and sizes, and alternative funding models utilized by other publicly managed solid waste programs in other states or countries that may be relevant to Washington. When considering potential statewide solid waste management policy changes, the study must evaluate recent policy proposals considered or enacted in the last four years, including proposals to reduce the load of organic material waste to landfills, managing packaging and paper products through extended producer responsibility programs, other proposed product stewardship or extended producer responsibility programs, improving or installing new or updated methane capture systems, proposals to support emerging markets to maximize the financial and environmental benefits that can be derived from managing organic material wastes, increases in any postconsumer content requirements for materials typically collected in solid waste programs, and other proposals or actions which may either be related to or influence, or both, solid waste funding resources. The study must evaluate the impacts of the policy changes on existing revenues for local government solid waste management programs and forecast any changes in existing revenue levels, any need for additional revenues, and changes in the level of service provided by and the costs to local government solid waste management programs.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department must establish and implement a compost reimbursement program to reimburse farming operations in the state for purchasing and using compost products that were not generated by the farming operation, including transportation, spreading equipment, labor, fuel, and maintenance costs associated with spreading equipment. The grant reimbursements under the program begin July 1, 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this program, &quot;farming operation&quot; means: A commercial agricultural, silvicultural, or aquacultural facility or pursuit, including the care and production of livestock and livestock products, poultry and poultry products, apiary products, and plant and animal production for nonfood uses; the planting, cultivating, harvesting, and processing of crops; and the farming or ranching of any plant or animal species in a controlled salt, brackish, or freshwater environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be eligible to participate in the reimbursement program, a farming operation must complete an eligibility review with the department prior to transporting or applying any compost products for which reimbursement is sought under this section. The purpose of the review is for the department to ensure that the proposed transport and application of compost products is consistent with the department's agricultural pest control rules established under chapter 17.24 RCW. A farming operation must also verify that it will allow soil sampling to be conducted by the department upon request before compost application and until at least 10 years after the last grant funding is used by the farming operation, as necessary to establish a baseline of soil quality and carbon storage and for subsequent department evaluations to assist the department's reporting requirements under subsection (8) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must create a form for eligible farming operations to apply for cost reimbursement for costs from purchasing and using compost from facilities with solid waste handling permits, including transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor costs. All applications for cost reimbursement must be submitted on the form along with invoices, receipts, or other documentation acceptable to the department of the costs of purchasing and using compost products for which the applicant is requesting reimbursement, as well as a brief description of what each purchased item will be used for. The department may request that an applicant provide information to verify the source, size, sale weight, or amount of compost products purchased and the cost of transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor.

<li>
<p>Compost products that it has transferred, or intends to transfer, to another individual or entity, whether or not for compensation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation may submit only one application per fiscal year for purchases made and usage costs incurred during the fiscal year that begins on July 1st and ends on June 30th of each fiscal year in which the program is in effect. Applications for reimbursement must be filed before the end of the fiscal year in which purchases were made and usage costs incurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must distribute reimbursement funds, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement if the farming operation's application was not found eligible for reimbursement by the department prior to transport or use under subsection (2) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for more than 50 percent of the costs it incurs each fiscal year for the purchase and use of compost products, including transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor costs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive more than $10,000 per fiscal year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for its own compost products or compost products that it has transferred, or intends to transfer, to another individual or entity, whether or not for compensation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for compost products that were not purchased from a facility with a solid waste handling permit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant shall indemnify and hold harmless the state and its officers, agents, and employees from all claims arising out of or resulting from the compost products purchased that are subject to the compost reimbursement program under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is established within the department a compost reimbursement program manager position. The compost reimbursement program manager must possess knowledge and expertise in the area of program management necessary to carry out the duties of the position, which are to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Facilitate the division and distribution of available costs for reimbursement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage the day-to-day coordination of the compost reimbursement program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department must submit an annual report to the appropriate committees of the legislature by January 15th of each year of the program in which grants have been issued or completed. The report must include:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>The legislature finds and declares that it is the public policy of the state that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Environmental marketing claims for plastic products, whether implicit or implied, should adhere to uniform and recognized standards for &quot;compostability&quot; and &quot;biodegradability,&quot; since misleading, confusing, and deceptive labeling can negatively impact local composting programs and compost processors. Plastic products marketed as being &quot;compostable&quot; should be readily and easily identifiable as meeting these standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legitimate and responsible packaging and plastic product manufacturers are already properly labeling their compostable products, but many manufacturers are not. Not all compost facilities and their associated processing technologies accept or are required to accept compostable packaging as feedstocks.
