<p>The legislature finds that recent research has shown that the use of <strong>cannabis</strong> may alleviate the nausea and ill effects of cancer chemotherapy and radiology, and, additionally, may alleviate the ill effects of glaucoma. The legislature further finds that there is a need for further research and experimentation regarding the use of <strong>cannabis</strong> under strictly controlled circumstances. It is for this purpose that the controlled substances therapeutic research act is hereby enacted.</p>
