<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>There is medical evidence that some patients with terminal or debilitating medical conditions may, under their health care professional's care, benefit from the medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong>. Some of the conditions for which <strong>cannabis</strong> appears to be beneficial include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Nausea, vomiting, and cachexia associated with cancer, HIV-positive status, AIDS, hepatitis C, anorexia, and their treatments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severe muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and other seizure and spasticity disorders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acute or chronic glaucoma;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crohn's disease; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some forms of intractable pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humanitarian compassion necessitates that the decision to use <strong>cannabis</strong> by patients with terminal or debilitating medical conditions is a personal, individual decision, based upon their health care professional's professional medical judgment and discretion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends that, so long as such activities are in strict compliance with this chapter:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Qualifying patients with terminal or debilitating medical conditions who, in the judgment of their health care professionals, may benefit from the medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong>, shall not be arrested, prosecuted, or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil consequences under state law based solely on their medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong>, notwithstanding any other provision of law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons who act as designated providers to such patients shall also not be arrested, prosecuted, or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil consequences under state law, notwithstanding any other provision of law, based solely on their assisting with the medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care professionals shall also not be arrested, prosecuted, or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil consequences under state law for the proper authorization of medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong> by qualifying patients for whom, in the health care professional's professional judgment, the medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong> may prove beneficial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter establishes the medical necessity or medical appropriateness of <strong>cannabis</strong> for treating terminal or debilitating medical conditions as defined in RCW 69.51A.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter diminishes the authority of correctional agencies and departments, including local governments or jails, to establish a procedure for determining when the use of <strong>cannabis</strong> would impact community safety or the effective supervision of those on active supervision for a criminal conviction, nor does it create the right to any accommodation of any medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong> in any correctional facility or jail.</p>

<p>In order to authorize for the medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong> under (a) of this subsection, the health care professional must:</p>

<li>
<p>Following an in-person physical examination to authorize the use of <strong>cannabis</strong> for medical purposes, the health care professional may determine and note in the patient's medical record that subsequent physical examinations for the purposes of renewing an authorization may occur through the use of telemedicine technology if the health care professional determines that requiring the qualifying patient to attend a physical examination in person to renew an authorization would likely result in severe hardship to the qualifying patient because of the qualifying patient's physical or emotional condition.</p>

<p>When renewing a qualifying patient's authorization for the medical use of <strong>cannabis</strong>, the health care professional may indicate that the qualifying patient qualifies for a compassionate care renewal of his or her registration in the medical <strong>cannabis</strong> authorization database and recognition card if the health care professional determines that requiring the qualifying patient to renew a registration in person would likely result in severe hardship to the qualifying patient because of the qualifying patient's physical or emotional condition.

<p>The appropriate health professions disciplining authority may inspect or request patient records to confirm compliance with this section.
