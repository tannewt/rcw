<p>The legislature recognizes and declares it to be the policy of this state, that it is a fundamental and inalienable right of the people of the state of Washington to live in a healthful and pleasant environment and to benefit from the proper development and use of its natural resources. The legislature further recognizes that as the population of our state grows, the need to provide for our increasing industrial, agricultural, residential, social, recreational, economic and other needs will place an increasing responsibility on all segments of our society to plan, coordinate, restore and regulate the utilization of our natural resources in a manner that will protect and conserve our clean air, our pure and abundant waters, and the natural beauty of the state.</p>

<p>In recognition of the responsibility of state government to carry out the policies set forth in RCW 43.21A.010, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish a single state agency with the authority to manage and develop our air and water resources in an orderly, efficient, and effective manner and to carry out a coordinated program of pollution control involving these and related land resources. To this end a department of ecology is created by this chapter to undertake, in an integrated manner, the various water regulation, management, planning and development programs now authorized to be performed by the department of water resources and the water pollution control commission, the air regulation and management program now performed by the state air pollution control board, the solid waste regulation and management program authorized to be performed by state government as provided by chapter 70A.205 RCW, and such other environmental, management protection and development programs as may be authorized by the legislature.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes that there exists a great risk of potential damage from oil pollution of the waters of the state of Washington and further declares that immediate steps must be undertaken to reduce this risk. The legislature also is aware that such danger is expected to increase in future years in proportion to the increase in the size and cargo capacity of ships, barges, and other waterborne carriers, the construction and operational characteristics of these carriers, the density of waterborne traffic, and the need for a greater supply of petroleum products.</p>
<p>A program of systematic baseline studies to be conducted by the department of ecology has been recognized as a vital part of the efforts to reduce the risk of oil pollution of marine waters, and the legislature recognizes that many factors combine to make this effort one of considerable magnitude and difficulty. The marine shoreline of the state is about two thousand seven hundred miles long, a greater length than the combined coastlines of Oregon and California. There are some three million acres of submerged land and more than three hundred islands in these marine waters. The average depth of Puget Sound is two hundred twenty feet. There is a great diversity of animal life in the waters of the state. These waters have a multitude of uses by both humans and nonhumans, and the interaction between human activities and natural processes in these waters varies greatly with locale.</p>

Full utilization of related historical data shall be made in planning these studies. Data from these and other scientific investigations made pursuant to RCW 43.21A.405 through 43.21A.420 should, whenever possible, have multiple use, including use as supporting evidence of environmental damage resulting from oil pollution, as indicators of the potential or existing risks and impacts of oil pollution, as aids to developing a methodology for implementing the reduction of risks, and as aids to maintaining water quality standards.</p>
<p>A baseline study program shall take full advantage of the data and information produced by related programs, such as the marine ecosystems analysis (MESA) program of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, studies and inventories made pursuant to the state shorelines management act of 1971, and others. All phases of the program, including planning, operations, data analysis, interpretation, storage, retrieval, and dissemination phases, shall be coordinated to the greatest possible extent with appropriate governmental, academic, and industrial organizations.

<li>
<p>The cost-reimbursement agreement shall identify the tasks and costs for work to be conducted under the agreement. The agreement must include a schedule that states:</p>
<ol type="a">

The department may also use funds provided under a cost-reimbursement agreement to hire temporary employees, to assign current staff to review the work of the consultant, to provide necessary technical assistance when an independent consultant with comparable technical skills is unavailable, and to recover reasonable and necessary direct and indirect costs that arise from processing the permit. The department shall, in developing the agreement, ensure that final decisions that involve policy matters are made by the agency and not by the consultant. The department shall make an estimate of the number of permanent staff hours to process the permits, and shall contract with consultants or hire temporary employees to replace the time and functions committed by these permanent staff to the project. The billing process shall provide for accurate time and cost accounting and may include a billing cycle that provides for progress payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost-reimbursement agreement must not negatively impact the processing of other permit applications. In order to maintain permit processing capacity, the agency may hire outside consultants, temporary employees, or make internal administrative changes.
