<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that young people discharging from publicly funded systems of care are at increased risk of homelessness. Youth and young adults experiencing homelessness face traumatic events at a higher rate than their peers who have stable housing. Homelessness has long-term impacts on brain development and well-being and creates barriers to education and employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 43.330.720 establishes a goal that any unaccompanied youth discharged from a publicly funded system of care in our state will be discharged into safe and stable housing. The office of homeless youth prevention and protection programs and the department of children, youth, and families published the improving stability for youth exiting systems of care report in 2020 outlining steps to achieve this goal. These steps provide a multipronged approach to ensure youth exit publicly funded systems of care into safe and stable housing, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>System-level support while youth are in the custody of publicly funded systems of care to ensure effective transition from care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community-level connections and services to provide support when youth transition back to the community; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources to secure and maintain stable housing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to implement community services, system response, and flexible resources to support the goal established under RCW 43.330.720 that youth discharged from publicly funded systems of care are discharged into safe and stable housing with the appropriate supports in place to provide a strong footing.</p>

<p>The department, in coordination with the office of homeless youth prevention and protection programs, the department of social and health services, and the health care authority, shall develop and implement a rapid response team that is prepared to respond appropriately to support youth and young adults exiting a publicly funded system of care.
