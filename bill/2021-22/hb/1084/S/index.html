<p>High-efficiency electric space and water heating equipment, such as electric heat pumps for space heating and electric heat pump water heaters, lower overall energy demand and system costs and improve indoor air quality and environmental outcomes.</p>
<p>As Washington transitions to 100 percent clean electricity, switching from fossil-fuel based heating equipment to high-efficiency electric equipment will reduce climate impacts and fuel price risks in the long term and can have a positive impact on overburdened communities.</p>
<p>In order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in RCW 70A.45.020, the state must require construction of increasingly low-emission energy efficient homes and buildings and achieve construction of zero fossil-fuel greenhouse gas emission homes and buildings by 2030. A 2020 report by the United States climate alliance found that Washington had nearly 90,000 clean energy jobs in 2019. The top categories of clean energy jobs are in the buildings sector, including: High-efficiency heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; energy efficiency technologies; and renewable heating and cooling. As the fastest growing clean energy industries in our state, work in these areas also supports job creation in other construction trades, which is a critical component of a clean energy economic recovery strategy and can increase diversity in the workforce.</p>
<p>Stable and predictable policy and regulatory frameworks are necessary to stimulate the critical social dialogue and collaboration to ensure a just transition for workers, including solutions to continue to provide meaningful work for skilled tradespersons, establish and sustain institutional and technical capacities to support affected workers, and mobilize funding and assistance to those in need. It is the intent of the legislature to both provide regulatory certainty and tools and resources to support the transition of companies that engage in the distribution of fossil fuels for residential and commercial heating, and to workers who are employed in the sectors affected by the transition to cleaner heating sources.</p>
<p>In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the need and potential for updating the building stock, more robust benchmarking and reporting for building performance, operations, and maintenance is needed. While the state has adopted comprehensive reporting requirements for larger commercial buildings, it currently lacks similar requirements for smaller commercial buildings. It is the intent of the legislature to extend existing building benchmarking and operations and maintenance planning requirements to smaller commercial buildings, in order to assess the needs and opportunities for job creation, incentives, and environmental and public health improvements.</p>
<p>Utilities have an important role in providing affordable and reliable heating and other energy services. As the state transitions to cleaner sources of energy, utilities are an important partner in helping their customers make smart energy choices, and actively supporting the replacement of fossil fuel-based space and water heating equipment with high-efficiency electric equipment.</p>
<p>Programs for the electrification of homes and buildings have the potential to allow electric utilities to optimize the use of electric grid infrastructure, improve the management of electric loads, better manage the integration of variable renewable energy resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector, mitigate the environmental impacts of utility operations and power purchases, and improve health outcomes for occupants due to improved indoor air quality.</p>
<p>Clarity is important so that each utility, depending on its unique circumstances and consistent with enabling statutes, the state Constitution, and good public policy, may determine its appropriate role in advancing home and building electrification for its customers.</p>
<p>In order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas limits in the energy sectors of the economy, more resources must be directed toward achieving electrification and decarbonization of residential and commercial heating loads, while continuing to relieve energy burdens that exist in low-income households and overburdened communities.</p>

If a state greenhouse gases registry is established, a utility that has purchased, traded, or banked greenhouse gases mitigation mechanisms under this section shall receive credit in the registry. <strong>Mitigation may also include implementation of programs including, but not limited to, beneficial electrification programs that result in quantifiable and verified reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from homes and buildings located in the utility's service territory. A utility may promote and advertise a greenhouse gas emissions reduction program to its ratepayers.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A heat pump and electrification program is established within the department. The purpose of the program is to support job creation and workforce development through the transition of residential and commercial buildings away from fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions by providing incentives, education, and outreach resources for the installation of high-efficiency electric heat pumps and other electric equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall implement a statewide heat pump program consistent with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide coordination and technical assistance to utilities, housing providers, residential and commercial builders, and the public to promote the adoption of high-efficiency electric heat pump equipment for space and water heating;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and distribute educational materials about the benefits of heat pump technology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop strategies to ensure that the program prioritizes services to low-income households, vulnerable populations, and highly impacted communities, including dedicating a portion of the program funding for this purpose. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(c), &quot;highly impacted communities&quot; has the same meaning as defined in RCW 80.28.005;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In coordination with the state apprenticeship and training council, support the further development of workforce training for the installation of high-efficiency electric heat pump equipment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convene a community-based advisory committee led by community-based organizations to ensure that workforce training is accessible to diverse communities in order to reverse patterns of discrimination present in the clean energy workforce; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and implement an incentive program for residential and commercial building owners that convert from a fossil fuel space or water heating system to a high-efficiency electric heat pump. In developing the incentive, the department must implement higher payments for those with low or moderate incomes, residents or owners of rental properties, and other populations who may be overburdened and vulnerable. Projects or activities funded from the incentive must meet high labor standards, including family sustaining wages, providing benefits including health care and pensions, career development opportunities, and maximize access to economic benefits from such projects for local workers and diverse businesses by providing support and development opportunities for diverse workers and businesses. Each contracting entity's proposal must be reviewed for equity and opportunity improvement efforts, including: (i) Employer paid sick leave programs; (ii) pay practices in relation to living wage indicators such as the self-sufficiency standard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology living wage calculator; (iii) efforts to evaluate pay equity based on gender identity, race, and other protected status under Washington law; (iv) facilitating career development opportunities such as state registered apprenticeships, internships, and on-the-job training; and (v) employment assistance and employment barriers for justice affected individuals. The department may align the incentive program with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the refrigerants used in incentivized products and equipment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is authorized to contract with a nonprofit trade association, regional market transformation organization, or community organization to implement the program in partnership with community-based workforce and contractor development organizations to assist with developments and must consider contractor inclusion plans in coordination with the office of women and minority-owned businesses.</p>
