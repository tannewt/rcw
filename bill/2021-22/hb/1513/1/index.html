<ol>
<li>
<p>The emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, is a significant contributor to anthropogenic climate change, and has devastating adverse impacts on Washington's economy, environment, natural resources, and communities. Our state is already experiencing rising sea levels, depleting snowpack, increased flooding, acidifying oceans, and more frequent and severe wildfires. These impacts impair our prosperity and impose burdensome costs on our businesses and communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Climate risk is economic risk, and it is imperative that Washington act now to safeguard the state's communities and industries against future shocks and disasters by putting a price on practices that increase the state's exposure to risk and investing in those that increase resilience. From farmers whose business is directly threatened by the climate crisis, to coastal communities at risk of outright displacement, the state must act now by investing locally at the scale needed to move all Washingtonians toward a future of shared prosperity as we build the clean economy here in Washington state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state is home to some of the world's most innovative companies, a highly skilled workforce, and important industries. As our state transitions away from a fossil fuel-based economy, we must do so in a way that protects these assets and allows our businesses to thrive. By launching a comprehensive fiscal program that incentivizes and invests in resilient infrastructure and climate-smart investments across all areas of development, we can reduce our state's carbon dioxide emissions while preparing our economy for the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington is home to more than 10,000,000 acres of working forestlands, including private lands and state trust lands. These lands represent the foundation of a forest products industry that sequesters massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere simply through its standard, baseline operations. These working forests are one of the state's greatest natural assets in combating global greenhouse gas emissions. A statewide carbon policy must support and maintain the ecosystem values provided by the forest products industry. Healthy, sustainable, working forests maximize the forests' ability to absorb carbon dioxide with lumber and other forest products continuing to sequester that carbon dioxide in their useful life. For these reasons, this chapter exempts certain timber-related uses of fuels subject to the carbon pollution tax imposed under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington is also home to one of the most productive and innovative agricultural sectors in the world. Agriculture is not only critical to our economy, but it is integral to our culture. With farmers and farmworkers on the front lines of climate-related disruption such as wildfire, flooding, drought, pests, and other threats to the land, labor, and the business of farming, investing in practices that increase the natural and economic resilience of and decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from Washington agriculture is critical. Farmers have been leading the way on land stewardship and soil health for decades, while operating in a highly trade-exposed and price-constrained industry that imposes singular economic challenges. For these reasons, this chapter exempts certain agricultural uses of fuels subject to the carbon pollution tax imposed under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fossil fuel combustion is also responsible for other pollutants, such as nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, benzene, particulate matter, and others that contribute to respiratory diseases like asthma and lung cancer, which compromise public health, shorten life expectancy, and strain our public health system. This pollution affects all Washingtonians, but falls disproportionately on low-income communities, communities of color, and the most vulnerable of our population. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will therefore contribute to improved air quality and improved public health outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes and finds that the public interest includes, but is not limited to: The equitable distribution of energy benefits and reduction of burdens to vulnerable populations and highly impacted communities; long-term and short-term public health, economic, and environmental benefits and the reduction of costs and risks; and energy security and resiliency. It is the intent of the legislature that in achieving this policy for Washington, there should not be an increase in environmental health impacts to highly impacted communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington is leading the transition to a clean energy economy, and in 2019 the state adopted the Washington clean energy transformation act, chapter 19.405 RCW, to eliminate coal-fired electricity, ensure that all retail sales of electricity to Washington customers are greenhouse gas neutral by January 1, 2030, supply 100 percent of all retail sales to Washington customers with nonemitting and renewable resources by January 1, 2045, and established strong compliance and enforcement mechanisms. Because of the stringent requirements of the Washington clean energy transformation act, the electricity sector is exempt from the carbon pollution tax established in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the concern from imposing the requirements of this chapter on energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries in our state and the possibility that these requirements might provide a comparative disadvantage to producers in unregulated states or counties, leading to a migration of manufacturing to unregulated states or countries and thereby generating a corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which would undermine the purposes of this chapter. Because of the concern of leakage, the department of ecology must provide a report to the governor and the appropriate committees of the legislature by July 30, 2026, with recommendations on imposing the requirements of this chapter on energy-intensive, trade-exposed entities as identified in section 3 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter establishes a carbon pollution tax to account for a significant share of the economic and environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. The revenue from the tax will facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy and fund investments that will benefit our businesses, our families, and our communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, this act establishes a ten-year, climate finance program that provides much needed additional capacity to invest in a just transition that protects our communities and our economy from future disasters and builds the low-carbon future here in Washington state. This finance program mandates that investment decisions are made in a manner that provides accountability in government spending through a fiscally responsible bond program that invests at scale in climate priorities and delivers maximum returns in the forms of both economic activity and carbon pollution reduction. These investments will not only save Washington taxpayers billions of dollars in avoidable future costs, but also foster growth and stability for rural and urban communities alike, across diverse economic sectors.</p>

<p>Beginning January 1, 2023, a carbon pollution tax is imposed in the state at a rate of tax equal to $25 per metric ton of greenhouse gas emissions. The tax rate automatically increases on January 1, 2024, and each year thereafter, at a rate of five percent per year, and is adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As of January 1, 2030, if the department of ecology, based on data collected by the department on total fuels subject to the tax in (a) of this subsection in the previous year, determines that the sources of emissions covered by the tax are not predicted to achieve their combined share of the emissions reductions necessary for the state to achieve the emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, the tax rate established in (a) of this subsection increases by $10 effective as of January 1, 2031. Each year thereafter, the tax rate continues to increase by five percent per year plus inflation, with an additional increase of $2 per year until the department of ecology determines that the sources of emissions covered by the tax rate are expected to meet the limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, at which point the additional $2 per year increase is retired, and the annual rate of increase returns to five percent plus inflation. Every two years between the years 2030 and 2050, the department, in consultation with the department of ecology, must reevaluate the necessary tax rate to ensure the state achieves a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The department of ecology must make the determinations required under this subsection (1)(b) and notify the department by April 1st of each odd-numbered year.</p>
