<p>The legislature recognizes that people with disabilities are often left out of the policy decisions that affect them most. People with disabilities have lived experience navigating societal barriers and are therefore best equipped to find solutions. According to the centers for disease control and prevention, one in five Washingtonians have a disability; approximately 22 percent of the state population. The disability community is the one minority group that individuals can join at any point in their life and has been described by the United States department of labor as the largest minority group in the country. As such, the disability community is extremely diverse and made up of people with many different identities and experiences. People with disabilities face greater hardships finding and maintaining employment that pays a living wage, attaining higher education, and finding places to live. The poverty rate for people with disabilities in Washington is 20 percent, which is nearly twice the rate for people without disabilities. In addition, people with disabilities are employed at less than half the rate of people without disabilities despite the fact that with reasonable accommodations people with disabilities thrive in the workplace. As a result, many individuals rely on a fixed income and public benefits. Because people with disabilities make less money, and their income is often supplemented by the government, they may have trouble finding places to live. This causes many people with disabilities to rely on affordable housing solutions which are not always accessible. People with disabilities, particularly people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, fight negative stereotypes, stigma, and ableism every day in order to live dignified and autonomous lives. It is essential that people with disabilities have the opportunity to participate in and guide decision-making processes on policies and practices that impact their lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds people with disabilities are almost entirely unrepresented in policy making yet are disproportionately impacted by government decisions. Access is an equity issue and by addressing barriers to participation for people with disabilities the greater public will also benefit. A governing body that makes decisions about disability cannot do so effectively without the participation and contribution of those who have lived experience with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to ensure meaningful participation from people with disabilities on each statutorily created or mandated task force, work group, advisory committee, or other entity tasked with examining policies or issues affecting people with disabilities. When people with disabilities have a seat at the table, Washington thrives.</p>
