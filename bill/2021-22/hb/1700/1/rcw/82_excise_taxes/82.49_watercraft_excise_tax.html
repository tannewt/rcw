<ol>
<li>
<p>An excise tax is imposed for the privilege of using a vessel upon the waters of this state, except vessels exempt under RCW 82.49.020. The annual amount of the excise tax is one-half of one percent of fair market value, as determined under this chapter, or five dollars, whichever is greater. Violation of this subsection is a misdemeanor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who is required under chapter 88.02 RCW to register a vessel in this state and who fails to register the vessel in this state or registers the vessel in another state or foreign country and avoids the Washington watercraft excise tax is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and is liable for such unpaid excise tax. The department of revenue may assess and collect the unpaid excise tax under chapter 82.32 RCW, including the penalty imposed in RCW 82.49.080 and penalties and interest provided in chapter 82.32 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The excise tax upon a vessel registered for the first time in this state shall be imposed for a twelve-month period, including the month in which the vessel is registered, unless the director of licensing extends or diminishes vessel registration periods for the purpose of staggered renewal periods under RCW 88.02.560. A vessel is registered for the first time in this state when the vessel was not registered in this state for the immediately preceding registration year, or when the vessel was registered in another jurisdiction for the immediately preceding year.</p>

<p>The department of revenue shall prepare at least once each year a depreciation schedule for use in the determination of fair market value for the purposes of this chapter. The schedule shall be based upon information available to the department of revenue pertaining to the current fair market value of vessels. The fair market value of a vessel for the purposes of this chapter shall be based on the most recent purchase price depreciated according to the year of the most recent purchase of the vessel. The most recent purchase price is the consideration, whether money, credit, rights, or other property expressed in terms of money, paid or given or contracted to be paid or given by the purchaser to the seller for the vessel.</p>
