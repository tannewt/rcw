<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/36_counties/36.024_county_coroner.html">36.24</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/36_counties/36.024_county_coroner.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within 12 months of assuming office, a person who files a declaration of candidacy for the office of coroner or county medical examiner must have a certificate of completion of medicolegal forensic investigation training that complies with the standards adopted for the medicolegal training academy adopted by the criminal justice training commission in conjunction with the Washington association of coroners and medical examiners and a practicing physician selected by the commission pursuant to section 3 of this act. A county in which the coroner or county medical examiner has not obtained such certification within 12 months of assuming office is ineligible to receive reimbursement from the death investigations account under RCW 68.50.104.</p>

<p>Except those run by a county prosecutor, all county coroner's offices and medical examiner's offices must be accredited by either the international association of coroners and medical examiners or the national association of medical examiners no later than July 1, 2025, and maintain continued accreditation thereafter. A county that contracts for its coroner or medical examiner services with an accredited coroner or medical examiner's office in another county does not need to maintain accreditation.</p>
