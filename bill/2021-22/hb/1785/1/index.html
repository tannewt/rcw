<p>The minimum monthly salary paid to state patrol troopers and sergeants must be competitive with law enforcement agencies within the boundaries of the state of Washington, guided by the results of a survey undertaken in the collective bargaining process during each biennium.  Compensation must be calculated using base salary, premium pay (a pay received by more than a majority of employees), education pay, and longevity pay. The compensation comparison data is based on the Washington state patrol and the law enforcement agencies listed in this section. Increases <strong>for sergeants will be extended to the</strong> salary levels for captains and lieutenants <strong>through the collective bargaining process to ensure proportionality of</strong> increases .</p>

<p><strong>Until July 1, 2028, the comparisons for determining competitiveness with other law enforcement agency salary levels must be guided by the average of compensation paid to the corresponding rank from the Seattle police department, King county sheriff's office, Tacoma police department, Snohomish county sheriff's office, Spokane police department, and Vancouver police department.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Beginning July 1, 2028, the comparisons for determining competitiveness with other law enforcement agency salary levels must be guided by the average of compensation paid to the corresponding rank from the Seattle police department, King county sheriff's office, Tacoma police department, Snohomish county sheriff's office, Spokane police department, and Vancouver police department, unless the office of financial management determines that one or more agencies should be replaced in this comparison with another law enforcement agency pursuant to the periodic evaluation process specified in (b)(iii) of this subsection.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By January 1, 2028, and each decade thereafter, the office of financial management must conduct an evaluation of the six agencies that are relevant for comparison to ensure state patrol troopers and sergeant salary levels are competitive with other law enforcement agencies within the boundaries of the state of Washington. If the office of financial management determines that one or more agencies specified in (b)(ii) of this subsection should be replaced in this comparison with a different law enforcement agency that is more relevant to ensure salary competitiveness, the office of financial management may utilize that revised compensation comparison data in the survey undertaken in the collective bargaining process during each biennium.</strong></p>

<li>
<p>By December 1, 2024, as part of the salary survey required in this section, the office of financial management must report to the governor and transportation committees of the legislature on the efficacy of Washington state patrol recruitment and retention efforts. Using the results of the 2016 salary survey as the baseline data, the report must include an analysis of voluntary resignations of state patrol troopers and sergeants and a comparison of state patrol academy class sizes and trooper graduations.</p>

<p>In addition to the classes of employees listed in RCW 41.56.030(14), the provisions of RCW 41.56.430 through 41.56.452 and 41.56.470, 41.56.480, and 41.56.490 also apply to Washington state patrol officers appointed under RCW 43.43.020 as provided in this section, subject to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Within <strong>10</strong> working days after the first Monday in September of every odd‑numbered year, the state's bargaining representative and the bargaining representative for the appropriate bargaining unit shall attempt to agree on an interest arbitration panel consisting of three members to be used if the parties are not successful in negotiating a comprehensive collective bargaining agreement. Each party shall name one person to serve as its arbitrator on the arbitration panel. The two members so appointed shall meet within seven days following the appointment of the later appointed member to attempt to choose a third member to act as the neutral chair of the arbitration panel. Upon the failure of the arbitrators to select a neutral chair within seven days, the two appointed members shall use one of the two following options in the appointment of the third member, who shall act as chair of the panel: (a) By mutual consent, the two appointed members may jointly request the commission to, and the commission shall, appoint a third member within two days of such a request. Costs of each party's appointee shall be borne by each party respectively; other costs of the arbitration proceedings shall be borne by the commission; or (b) either party may apply to the commission, the federal mediation and conciliation service, or the American arbitration association to provide a list of five qualified arbitrators from which the neutral chair shall be chosen. Each party shall pay the fees and expenses of its arbitrator, and the fees and expenses of the neutral chair shall be shared equally between the parties. Immediately upon selecting an interest arbitration panel, the parties shall cooperate to reserve dates with the arbitration panel for potential arbitration between August 1st and September 15th of the following even‑numbered year. The parties shall also prepare a schedule of at least five negotiation dates for the following year, absent an agreement to the contrary. The parties shall execute a written agreement before November 1st of each odd-numbered year setting forth the names of the members of the arbitration panel and the dates reserved for bargaining and arbitration. This subsection imposes minimum obligations only and is not intended to define or limit a party's full, good faith bargaining obligation under other sections of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mediator or arbitration panel may consider only matters that are subject to bargaining under RCW 41.56.473.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision of an arbitration panel is not binding on the legislature and, if the legislature does not approve the funds necessary to implement provisions pertaining to wages and wage-related matters of an arbitrated collective bargaining agreement, is not binding on the state or the Washington state patrol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In making its determination, the arbitration panel shall be mindful of the legislative purpose enumerated in RCW 41.56.430 and, as additional standards or guidelines to aid it in reaching a decision, shall take into consideration the following factors:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The constitutional and statutory authority of the employer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stipulations of the parties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparison of the hours and conditions of employment of personnel involved in the proceedings with the hours and conditions of employment of  like employers of similar size <strong>identified in RCW 43.43.380</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in any of the foregoing circumstances during the pendency of the proceedings; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such other factors, not confined to the foregoing, which are normally or traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of matters that are subject to bargaining under RCW 41.56.473.</p>
