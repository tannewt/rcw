<li>
<p>Service contract providers or protection product guarantee providers are considered to be the agent of <strong>each</strong> insurer which issued the reimbursement insurance policy <strong>or policies</strong> for purposes of obligating the insurer to service contract holders or protection product guarantee holders in accordance with the service contract or protection product guarantee holders and this chapter. Payment of the provider fee by the consumer to the service contract seller, service contract provider, or administrator or payment of consideration for the protection product to the protection product seller constitutes payment by the consumer to the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider and to <strong>each</strong> insurer which issued the reimbursement insurance policy <strong>or policies</strong>. In cases where a service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider is acting as an administrator and enlists other service contract providers or protection product guarantee providers, the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider acting as the administrator shall notify <strong>each</strong> insurer of the existence and identities of the other service contract providers or protection product guarantee providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter does not prevent or limit the right of an insurer which issued a reimbursement insurance policy to seek indemnification or subrogation against a service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider if the issuer pays or is obligated to pay the service contract holder or protection product guarantee holder sums that the service contract provider or protection product guarantee provider was obligated to pay under the provisions of the service contract or protection product guarantee.</p>
