<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Right-of-way&quot; means all state-owned land within a state highway corridor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Service provider&quot; means every corporation, company, association, joint stock association, firm, partnership, or person that owns, operates, or manages any personal wireless service facility. &quot;Service provider&quot; includes a service provider's contractors, subcontractors, and legal successors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish a process for issuing a lease for the use of the right-of-way by a service provider and shall require that telecommunications equipment be colocated on the same structure whenever practicable. Consistent with federal highway administration approval, the lease must include the right of direct ingress and egress from the highway for construction and maintenance of the personal wireless service facility during nonpeak hours if public safety is not adversely affected. Direct ingress and egress may be allowed at any time for the construction of the facility if public safety is not adversely affected and if construction will not substantially interfere with traffic flow during peak traffic periods. The lease may specify an indirect ingress and egress to the facility if it is reasonable and available for the particular location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost of the lease must be limited to the fair market value of the portion of the right-of-way being used by the service provider and the direct administrative expenses incurred by the department in processing the lease application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the department and the service provider are unable to agree on the cost of the lease, the service provider may submit the cost of the lease to binding arbitration by serving written notice on the department. Within thirty days of receiving the notice, each party shall furnish a list of acceptable arbitrators. The parties shall select an arbitrator; failing to agree on an arbitrator, each party shall select one arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator for an arbitration panel. The arbitrator or panel shall determine the cost of the lease based on comparable siting agreements. Costs of the arbitration, including compensation for the arbitrator's services, must be borne equally by the parties participating in the arbitration and each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including legal fees and witness expenses, in connection with the arbitration proceeding.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>The department shall act on an application for a lease within sixty days of receiving a completed application, unless a service provider consents to a different time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasons for a denial of a lease application must be supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may adopt rules to implement this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All lease money paid to the department under this section shall be deposited in the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070.</p>

<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section only, &quot;assault&quot; means an act by a motorist that results in physical injury to an employee of the department while engaged in highway construction or maintenance activities along a roadway right-of-way (fence line to fence line, landscaped areas) or in the loading and unloading of passenger vehicles in service of the vessel as a maritime employee not covered under chapter 51.32 RCW or engaged in those work activities as a Washington state ferries terminal employee covered under chapter 51.32 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In recognition of the nature of employment in departmental highway construction or maintenance activities and by the Washington state ferries, this section provides a supplementary program to reimburse employees of the department for some of their costs attributable to their being the victims of assault by motorists. This program is limited to the reimbursement provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee is entitled to receive the reimbursement provided in this section only if the secretary finds that each of the following has occurred:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A motorist has assaulted the employee who is engaged in highway construction or maintenance along a roadway right-of-way (fence line to fence line, landscaped areas) or service of the vessel as a maritime employee or terminal employee engaged in the loading or unloading of passenger vehicles and as a result the employee has sustained demonstrated physical injuries that have required the employee to miss one or more days of work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assault is not attributable to any extent to the employee's negligence, misconduct, or failure to comply with any rules or conditions of employment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of labor and industries has approved the employee's workers' compensation application under chapter 51.32 RCW, or for maritime employees the department of transportation risk management office has approved maintenance and cure benefits under 46 U.S.C. Sec. 688 et seq.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reimbursement authorized under this section is as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The employee's accumulated sick leave days will not be reduced for the workdays missed. The injured worker who qualifies for and receives assault benefits will also receive full standard benefits (vacation leave, sick leave, health insurance, etc.) as if uninjured;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an employee covered by chapter 51.32 RCW, for each workday missed for which the employee is not eligible to receive compensation under chapter 51.32 RCW, the employee will receive the full amount of the injured worker's net pay at the time of injury; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In respect to workdays missed for which the employee will receive or has received compensation under chapter 51.32 RCW, or under federal maritime law benefits, including the Jones Act, for an employee deemed a maritime employee assigned to work in service of the vessel or a nonmaritime terminal employee covered under chapter 51.32 RCW, the employee will be reimbursed in an amount that, when added to that compensation, will result in the employee receiving no more than full net pay (gross pay less mandatory and voluntary deductions) for the workdays missed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reimbursement under this section may not last longer than three hundred sixty-five consecutive days after the date of the injury. No application for assault benefits is valid nor may a claim be enforced unless it was made within one year after the day upon which the injury occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employee is not entitled to the reimbursement provided in subsection (4) of this section for a workday for which the secretary or an applicable designee finds that the employee has not diligently pursued his or her compensation remedies under chapter 51.32 RCW or federal maritime law, including the Jones Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reimbursement may be made only for absences that the secretary or an applicable designee believes are justified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the employee is receiving reimbursement under this section, he or she will continue to be classified as a state employee, and the reimbursement amount is considered as salary or wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall make all reimbursement payments required to be made to employees under this section. The payments are considered as a salary or wage expense and must be paid by the department in the same manner and from the same appropriations as other salary and wage expenses for the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes the department from recovering the supplemental payments authorized by this section from the assaulting motorist, and that recovery is considered exclusive of recovery under chapter 51.24 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the legislature revokes the reimbursement authorized under this section or repeals this section, no affected employee is entitled after that to receive the reimbursement as a matter of contractual right.</p>

The accommodation must be in the form of an agreement between the applicable local transit agency and the private transportation provider. The transit agency may require that the agreement include provisions to recover actual costs and fair market value for the use of the lot and its related facilities and to provide adequate insurance and indemnification of the transit agency, and other reasonable provisions to ensure that the private transportation provider's use does not unduly burden the transit agency. The transit agency may consider benefits to its public transportation system when establishing an amount to charge for the use of the park and ride lot and its related facilities. If the agreement includes provisions to recover actual costs, the private transportation provider is responsible to remit the full actual costs of park and ride lot use to the appropriate transit agency. No accommodation is required, and any agreement may be terminated, if the park and ride lot is at or exceeds ninety percent capacity between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday for two consecutive months. Additionally, any agreement may be terminated if the private transportation provider violates any policies guiding the terms of use of the park and ride lot.

Nonprofit organizations or local governments, including housing authorities, with a demonstrated history of managing or implementing low-income transportation clean alternative fuel and shared mobility pilot programs are eligible to participate in this program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must determine specific eligibility criteria, based on the requirements of this section, the report submitted to the legislature by the Puget Sound clean air agency entitled facilitating low-income utilization of electric vehicles, and other factors relevant to increasing clean alternative fuel vehicle use in underserved and low to moderate income communities. The department may adopt rules specifying the eligibility criteria it selects.</p>

<p>The department must include the following elements in its proposal evaluation and scoring methodology: History of successful management of equity focused clean alternative fuel vehicle projects; substantial level of involvement from community-based, equity focused organizations in the project; plan for long-term financial sustainability of the work beyond the duration of the grant period; matching resources leveraged for the project; and geographical diversity of the projects selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After selecting successful proposals under this section, the department may provide grant funding to them. The total grant amount available per project may range from fifty thousand to two hundred thousand dollars. The grant opportunity must include possible funding of vehicles, charging or refueling station infrastructure, staff time, and any other expenses required to implement the project. No more than ten percent of grant funds may be used for administrative expenses.</p>
