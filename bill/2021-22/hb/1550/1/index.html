<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature makes the following findings:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, particularly for children and youth under 21 years of age, whose brains are still developing. The 2019 national youth tobacco survey found that about 27 percent of high school students reported current use of electronic cigarettes and, among electronic cigarette users, about one-third reported using electronic cigarettes on 20 or more of the preceding 30 days. Washington state healthy youth survey data is similar, including 30 percent of 12th graders using e-cigarettes and vapor products. Many of those vapor products have very high nicotine levels, increasing youth addiction, in addition to numerous ingredients with well documented potential health effects identified in a formal health impact review by the state board of health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early research from Stanford University school of medicine indicates that teenagers and young adults that vape are five to seven times more likely to be infected with COVID-19 compared to those who do not use vapor products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the long-term health effects of vapor products are unknown, current data suggests they are harmful to human health. Vapor products have been shown to impair lung function in several ways, such as by inhibiting ciliary beating, impairing immune function, and causing toxicity to epithelial cells;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Youth and young adults who use vapor products are far more likely to begin smoking tobacco cigarettes than those who do not vape;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The health and economic costs on the state of Washington and its residents from addiction to tobacco products are well documented. The centers for disease control reports that cigarette smoking is responsible for one in five deaths annually nationwide and overall mortality among smokers is about three times higher than similar people who never smoked;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers often use vapor products interchangeably with cigarettes or other tobacco products. Nicotine is the common denominator; creating and sustaining addiction across Washington state. A meta-analysis by the American public health association found that vaping was not associated with increased smoking cessation, and further research shows most people who vape continue to use tobacco concurrently;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state grants preferential business and occupation tax treatment to encourage manufacturing of useful substances or products in Washington. Cigarette, vapor, and tobacco manufacturers have benefited from this preference despite the high health effects and costs on the state government from their products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019, the legislature enacted a vapor products tax based on milliliters of liquid in each product which was intended to both reduce youth access by raising the price of many youth-attractive vapor products and to dedicate the funding to a foundational public health services account for: Nicotine and substance use prevention, cessation, enforcement, and education; and public health services. The structure of the tax as enacted, however, did not significantly raise the price of very low-cost sealed vapor products that are very popular with youth under 21 years of age and fueling the epidemic of youth vaping and nicotine addiction. Nor did the structure of the tax provide the expected significant funding for the foundational public health services account; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tobacco and vape industries have specifically targeted marketing toward Black, indigenous, people of color, LGBTQ, and other marginalized communities. As a result, these communities experience higher rates of nicotine use and resulting health disparities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to protect the health of youth and young adults in Washington state by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Changing from a per milliliter tax to a more effective vapor product tax structure using an excise tax that will have a greater deterrent effect on purchases made by persons under the age of 21 while being more fair to stores that limit entry and purchases to adults over 21 years of age and increase the price of presealed high nicotine products that are heavily used by youth under 21 years of age;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stopping rewarding and encouraging manufacturers of nicotine addicting vapor and tobacco products through preferential tax rates for products that are amongst the deadliest products sold to Washington residents and which impose tremendous economic burdens on the state's health care systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discouraging the manufacture, processing, and distribution of nicotine addicting vapor and tobacco products and have them bear an increased share of the costs they cause on the state through a business and occupation tax surcharge;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significantly improving funding for programs that prevent and reduce nicotine addiction amongst youth and populations or communities that have disparately high nicotine addiction and use of tobacco or vapor products, and related educational and foundational public health services programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing other means of reducing youth addiction to nicotine and access to nicotine products; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjusting the distribution of the foundational public health services account to include an emphasis on community-based strategies addressing health inequity.</p>
