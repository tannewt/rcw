<li>
<p>The Washington advanced college tuition payment program shall be administered by the committee on advanced tuition payment which shall be chaired by the director of the office. The committee shall be supported by staff of the office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The Washington advanced college tuition payment program shall consist of the sale of tuition units, which may be redeemed by the beneficiary at a future date for an equal number of tuition units regardless of any increase in the price of tuition, that may have occurred in the interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each purchase shall be worth a specific number of or fraction of tuition units at each state institution of higher education as determined by the governing body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of tuition units necessary to pay for a full year's, full-time undergraduate tuition and fee charges at a state institution of higher education shall be set by the governing body at the time a purchaser enters into a tuition unit contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governing body may limit the number of tuition units purchased by any one purchaser or on behalf of any one beneficiary, however, no limit may be imposed that is less than that necessary to achieve four years of full-time, undergraduate tuition charges at a state institution of higher education. The governing body also may, at its discretion, limit the number of participants, if needed, to ensure the actuarial soundness and integrity of the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the Washington advanced college tuition payment program is designed to help all citizens of the state of Washington, the governing body may determine residency requirements for eligible purchasers and eligible beneficiaries to ensure the actuarial soundness and integrity of the program.</p>

<p>The governing body shall determine the conditions under which the tuition benefit may be transferred to another family member. In permitting such transfers, the governing body may not allow the tuition benefit to be bought, sold, bartered, or otherwise exchanged for goods and services by either the beneficiary or the purchaser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governing body shall administer the Washington advanced college tuition payment program in a manner reasonably designed to be actuarially sound, such that the assets of the trust will be sufficient to defray the obligations of the trust including the costs of administration.

<p><strong>Beginning with academic year 2022-23, the first time a beneficiary redeems tuition units for a qualified higher education expense, the governing body shall set the total original number of qualifying tuition units for the beneficiary's individual advanced college tuition payment program account for purposes of calculating a dividend.</strong></p>
<pre><code>a. **The governing body shall calculate a possible dividend for the individual advanced college tuition payment program account each time the beneficiary redeems tuition units based on the total original number of qualifying tuition units.**

    i. **The actual accumulated value;**

    ii. **The assumed accumulated value; and**

c. **If the adjusted accumulated value exceeds the unit payout value at the time of redemption, the individual advanced college tuition payment program account is eligible for a dividend. The dividend is the difference between the adjusted accumulated value and the unit payout value. The beneficiary shall receive a proportion of the dividend equal to the proportion of tuition units redeemed compared to the total original number of qualifying tuition units. The beneficiary has two options for receiving the dividend:**

    i. **In addition to the tuition units requested for redemption; or**

    ii. **In place of an equal number of tuition units requested for redemption.**

d. **The remaining unused portion of the dividend must not be held in a beneficiary's individual advanced college tuition payment program account for future use, and the unused dividend expires upon the beneficiary's receipt of requested tuition units.**

e. **The legislature reserves the right to amend or repeal the dividend at any time in the future, and no individual advanced college tuition payment program account holder or beneficiary has a contractual right to receive a dividend not granted prior to that time.**
