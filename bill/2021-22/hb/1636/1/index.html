<p>The legislature intends to reduce the financial pressure and uncertainty faced by gold star families by providing property tax relief. According to the United States military, a &quot;gold star&quot; family member is the father, mother, brother, sister, son, or daughter of one who dies in service to the nation. No one has given more to the nation than the families of the fallen. To provide the widest scope of benefit to gold star families, the legislature intends to provide a complete property tax exemption for one year for any property that is used by a gold star family member as their primary residence.</p>
