<h2 id="section-1-897">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-897">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that transportation patterns drastically changed in March 2020 after the governor proclaimed a state of emergency and associated proclamation to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Hundreds of thousands of employees are now working from home, with an expectation that they will continue to do so for months, if not years, to come. Revenues for transportation programs have plummeted. The legislature finds that this societal course change demands a reevaluation of the commute trip reduction program and reduction of related expenditures, including for costly vehicles that are not being used.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-743">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-743">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The joint transportation committee must conduct a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the statewide commute trip reduction program. The assessment must identify new trends in transportation behavior that have occurred since March 2020. It must reevaluate the commute trip reduction program statewide requirements and policies in light of the actual usage of transportation services and make recommendations for changes to the mandatory program elements and spending based on the new societal norms and drastic reduction of commuting and business travel. The assessment must provide a cost-benefit analysis based on usage and effectiveness of the different types of demand management measures identified in RCW 70A.15.4040 as implemented by the state and major employers required to adopt a commute trip reduction plan. The joint transportation committee should identify program elements that ought to be modified or eliminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint transportation committee must seek input from government agencies and major employers subject to the requirements of the commute trip reduction program from all across the state, as well as associations representing those businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing and implementing the assessment, the joint transportation committee must solicit input from representatives of the department of transportation, the Washington state association of counties, the association of Washington cities, two business associations that represent major employers required to implement a commute trip reduction plan, two employees that administer the commute trip reduction program for major employers, and two employees that administer the commute trip reduction program for government agencies, and others as deemed appropriate by the executive committee of the joint transportation committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recommendations must consider the different needs for employers and state agencies that are located outside of urban counties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint transportation committee must publicly hold a work session on a proposed work plan no later than December 31, 2021, and issue a report of its findings and recommendations to the transportation committees of the legislature by December 31, 2022.</p>

Jurisdictions located within an urban growth area with a population greater than seventy thousand that adopted a commute trip reduction ordinance before the year 2000, as well as any jurisdiction within contiguous urban growth areas, shall also adopt a commute trip reduction plan and ordinance for major employers in the affected urban growth area by a date specified by the commute trip reduction board. Jurisdictions containing a major employment installation in a county with an affected growth area, designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110, shall adopt a commute trip reduction plan and ordinance for major employers in the major employment installation by a date specified by the commute trip reduction board. The ordinance shall establish the requirements for major employers and provide an appeals process by which major employers, who as a result of special characteristics of their business or its locations would be unable to meet the requirements of the ordinance, may obtain waiver or modification of those requirements. The plan shall be designed to achieve reductions in the proportion of single-occupant vehicle commute trips and be consistent with the rules established by the department of transportation. The county, city, or town shall submit its adopted plan to the regional transportation planning organization. The county, city, or town plan shall be included in the regional commute trip reduction plan for regional transportation planning purposes, consistent with the rules established by the department of transportation in RCW 70A.15.4060.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All other counties, cities, and towns may adopt and implement a commute trip reduction plan consistent with department of transportation rules established under RCW 70A.15.4060. Tribal governments are encouraged to adopt a commute trip reduction plan for their lands. State investment in voluntary commute trip reduction plans shall be limited to those areas that meet criteria developed by the commute trip reduction board.</p>

<li>
<p>A commute trip reduction plan shall be consistent with the rules established under RCW 70A.15.4060 and shall include but is not limited to (a) goals for reductions in the proportion of single-occupant vehicle commute trips consistent with the state goals established by the commute trip reduction board under RCW 70A.15.4060 and the regional commute trip reduction plan goals established in the regional commute trip reduction plan; (b) a description of the requirements for major public and private sector employers to implement commute trip reduction programs; (c) a commute trip reduction program for employees of the county, city, or town; and (d) means, consistent with rules established by the department of transportation, for determining base year values and progress toward meeting commute trip reduction plan goals.

<p>The commute trip reduction plans adopted by counties, cities, and towns under this chapter shall be consistent with and may be incorporated in applicable state or regional transportation plans and local comprehensive plans and shall be coordinated, and consistent with, the commute trip reduction plans of counties, cities, or towns with which the county, city, or town has, in part, common borders or related regional issues. Such regional issues shall include assuring consistency in the treatment of employers who have worksites subject to the requirements of this chapter in more than one jurisdiction. Counties, cities, and towns adopting commute trip reduction plans may enter into agreements through the interlocal cooperation act or by resolution or ordinance as appropriate with other jurisdictions, local transit agencies, transportation management associations or other private or nonprofit providers of transportation services, or regional transportation planning organizations to coordinate the development and implementation of such plans. Transit agencies shall work with counties, cities, and towns as a part of their six-year transit development plan established in RCW 35.58.2795 to take into account the location of major employer worksites when planning and prioritizing transit service changes or the expansion of public transportation services, including rideshare services. Counties, cities, or towns adopting a commute trip reduction plan shall review it annually and revise it as necessary to be consistent with applicable plans developed under RCW 36.70A.070.
