The resolution of the city or town initiating such election shall, subject to RCW 35.02.170, describe the boundaries of the area to be annexed, as nearly as may be state the number of voters residing therein, pray for the calling of an election to be held among the qualified voters therein upon the question of annexation, and provide that said city or town will pay the cost of the annexation election. The resolution may require that there also be submitted to the electorate of the territory sought to be annexed a proposition that all property within the area annexed shall, upon annexation, be assessed and taxed at the same rate and on the same basis as the property of such annexing city or town is assessed and taxed to pay for all or any portion of the then outstanding indebtedness of the city or town to which said area is annexed, approved by the voters, contracted, or incurred prior to, or existing at, the date of annexation. Whenever a city or town has prepared and filed a comprehensive plan for the area to be annexed as provided for in RCW 35.13.177 and 35.13.178, the resolution initiating the election may also provide for the simultaneous adoption of the comprehensive plan upon approval of annexation by the electorate of the area to be annexed.</p>
