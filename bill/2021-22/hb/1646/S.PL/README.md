## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. In 2020, an estimated 120,000 Washingtonians age 65 and older were living with Alzheimer's disease or another dementia and the number is expected to rise to 140,000 by 2025;

2. Dementia affects the whole family in many ways, including pulling family members, most often women, out of the workforce to care for their loved ones with the disease;

3. There are an estimated 295,000 unpaid caregivers in Washington providing 426,000,000 total hours of unpaid care annually;

4. The legislature authorized the preparation of the first Washington state plan to address Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in 2016; and

5. There is great value in continuing to improve awareness and services for individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and reestablishing the formal dementia action collaborative to update the state plan and make recommendations is essential.
