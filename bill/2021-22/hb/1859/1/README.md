[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1859.SL.pdf)
## Section 1
The purpose of this act is to create an interagency coordination team responsible for the program that establishes and maintains quality standards for laboratories conducting analysis of recreational and medicinal cannabis with THC levels greater than 0.3 percent. The interagency team includes the department of agriculture, the liquor and cannabis board, and the department of health. The standards must be adopted by rule by the department of agriculture, and changes to standards may require reference in liquor and cannabis board and department of health rules. This authority to establish these rules transfers from the liquor and cannabis board to the department of agriculture. This act implements the recommendations of the cannabis science task force established in RCW 43.21A.735.

According to the task force's recommendations: "Laboratory quality standards are the elements used in the evaluation of a product's compliance with established product standards. They consist of approved methods, method validation protocols, and performance measures and criteria applied to the testing of the product. Establishing appropriate and well-defined laboratory quality standards is essential to communicate to the testing laboratories what standardized practices and procedures are appropriate.

Laboratory quality standards help ensure the data that laboratories generate are credible and can be used to provide consumer protections. They should represent sound scientific protocols, and detail practical and specific guidance for the testing subject matter. Together, well-established product standards, laboratory quality standards, and accreditation standards should function to garner confidence for consumers and the industry they support."

## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [69.50.348](/rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.50_uniform_controlled_substances_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.50_uniform_controlled_substances_act.md) for context.

1. On a schedule determined by the state liquor and cannabis board, every licensed marijuana producer and processor must submit representative samples of marijuana, useable marijuana, or marijuana-infused products produced or processed by the licensee to an independent, third-party testing laboratory **. The purpose of testing representative samples is** to certify compliance with quality assurance and product standards adopted by the state liquor and cannabis board under RCW 69.50.342 **or the department of health under RCW 69.50.375. In conducting tests of cannabis product samples, testing laboratories must adhere to laboratory quality standards adopted by the state department of agriculture under chapter 15.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 9 of this act)**. Any sample remaining after testing shall be destroyed by the laboratory or returned to the licensee submitting the sample.

2. **Independent, third-party testing laboratories performing cannabis product testing under subsection (1) of this section must obtain and maintain accreditation.**

3. Licensees must submit the results of inspection and testing for quality assurance and product standards required under subsection (1) of this section to the state liquor and cannabis board on a form developed by the state liquor and cannabis board.

4. If a representative sample inspected and tested under this section does not meet the applicable quality assurance and product standards established by the state liquor and cannabis board, the entire lot from which the sample was taken must be destroyed.

5. The state liquor and cannabis board may adopt rules necessary to implement this section**. The state liquor and cannabis board may adopt rules necessary to implement subsection (2) of this section until a successor state agency or agencies assume responsibility for establishing and administering laboratory standards and accreditation**.


## Section 6
> This section modifies existing section [69.50.348](/rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.50_uniform_controlled_substances_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.50_uniform_controlled_substances_act.md) for context.

1. On a schedule determined by the state liquor and cannabis board, every licensed marijuana producer and processor must submit representative samples of marijuana, useable marijuana, or marijuana-infused products produced or processed by the licensee to an independent, third-party testing laboratory meeting the accreditation requirements established by the state department of ecology**. The purpose of testing representative samples is** to certify compliance with quality assurance and product standards adopted by the state liquor and cannabis board under RCW 69.50.342 **or the department of health under RCW 69.50.375.
