<p>By July 1, 2022, the department must adopt by rule objective criteria for both emissions' intensity and trade exposure for the purpose of identifying emissions-intensive, trade-exposed <strong>facilities</strong> during the second compliance period of the program and subsequent compliance periods. A <strong>manufacturing</strong> facility covered by subsection (1)(a) through (m) of this section is considered an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility and is eligible for allocation of no cost allowances as described in this section. In addition, any covered party that <strong>owns or operates a manufacturing facility</strong> that can demonstrate to the department that it meets the objective criteria adopted by rule is also eligible for treatment as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed and is eligible for allocation of no cost allowances as described in this section. In developing the objective criteria under this subsection, the department must consider the locations of facilities potentially identified as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed <strong>facilities</strong> relative to overburdened communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For the first compliance period beginning in January 1, 2023, the annual allocation of no cost allowances for direct distribution to a facility identified as emissions-intensive and trade-exposed must be equal to the facility's baseline carbon intensity established using data from 2015 through 2019, or other data as allowed under this section, multiplied by the facility's actual production for each calendar year during the compliance period. For facilities using the mass-based approach, the allocation of no cost allowances shall be equal to the facility's mass-based baseline using data from 2015 through 2019, or other data as allowed under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the second compliance period, beginning in January, 2027, and in each subsequent compliance period, the annual allocation of no cost allowances established in (a) of this subsection shall be adjusted according to the benchmark reduction schedules established in (b)(ii) and (iii) and (e) of this subsection multiplied by the facility's actual production during the period. The department shall adjust the no cost allocation of allowances and credits to an emissions-intensive and trade-exposed facility to avoid duplication with any no cost allowances transferred pursuant to RCW 70A.65.120 and 70A.65.130, if applicable.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For the purpose of this section, &quot;carbon intensity&quot; means the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from a facility in metric tons divided by the facility specific measure of production including, but not limited to, units of product manufactured or sold, over the same time interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an emissions-intensive and trade-exposed facility is not able to feasibly determine a carbon intensity benchmark based on its unique circumstances, the entity may elect to use a mass-based baseline that does not vary based on changes in production volumes. The mass-based baseline must be based upon data from 2015 through 2019, unless the emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility can demonstrate that there have been abnormal periods of operation that materially impacted the facility and the baseline period should be expanded to include years prior to 2015. For each year during the first four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2023, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 100 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. For each year during the second four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2027, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 97 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. For each year during the third compliance period that begins January 1, 2031, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 94 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. <strong>For the year beginning January 1, 2035, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 88 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. For each year beginning January 1, 2036, until January 1, 2050, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances that must be six percentage points below the percentage of no cost allowances awarded during the preceding year.</strong> Except as provided in (b)(iii) of this subsection, if a facility elects to use a mass-based baseline, it may not later convert to a carbon intensity benchmark during the first three compliance periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A facility with a North American industry classification system code beginning with 3364 that is utilizing a mass-based baseline in (b)(ii) of this subsection must receive an additional no cost allowance allocation under this section in order to accommodate an increase in production that increases its emissions above the baseline on a basis equivalent in principle to those awarded to entities utilizing a carbon intensity benchmark pursuant to this subsection (3)(b). The department shall establish methods to award, for any annual period, additional no cost allowance allocations under this section and, if appropriate based on projected production, to achieve a similar ongoing result through the adjustment of the facility's mass-based baseline. An eligible facility under this subsection that has elected to use a mass-based baseline may not convert to a carbon intensity benchmark until the next compliance period.</p>

<li>
<p>By September 15, 2022, each emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility shall submit its carbon intensity baseline for the first compliance period to the department.

<pre><code>    ii.(A) **If the facility claims that it is already employing best available technology, the application must provide a detailed description of the technology and all data and information that may be relevant to the department's determination as to whether the facility is employing best available technology. The department may require an applicant to submit data or other information as necessary to allow the department to determine what constitutes best available technology for the applicant. The department may request or consider data and information regarding best available technology sourced from a person other than an applicant. The department must deny an application for which it does not have sufficient data or information to allow it to determine what constitutes best available technology.**
</code></pre>
<p>(B) <strong>If the facility is not already employing best available technology, the application must set forth a detailed and credible plan to employ best available technology within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 12 years. The plan must include a description of each technology, component, process, improvement, equipment, or other action or investment that will result in reductions in the facility's carbon intensity or mass-based emissions, and the year of deployment and the emissions reductions anticipated from each such action or investment; a description of how the best available technology will be designed, installed, and operated; and a description of how the best available technology will be financed, which may include a proposed cost share with the state using funds made available from the climate commitment account or the dedication of any revenues generated from allowances allocated to the owner or operator of the facility under this section. The plan must also include an estimate of, and all relevant data and information concerning, what the facility's carbon intensity or mass-based baseline will be once the facility is employing best available technology and for each year prior to the completion of the plan to employ best available technology. The department may require an applicant to submit data or other information as necessary to allow the department to determine what constitutes best available technology for the applicant. The department may request or consider data and information regarding best available technology sourced from a person other than an applicant. The department must deny an application for which it does not have sufficient data or information to allow it to determine what constitutes best available technology.</strong></p>
<pre><code>    iii. **The department must grant the application if the department determines, based upon a review of the data and information submitted by the facility and any other relevant data and information, that:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>The facility is already employing best available technology; or</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>The facility is not employing best available technology but has a detailed and credible plan to employ best available technology within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 12 years, in a manner that will result in additional reductions in carbon intensity or mass-based emissions. The department and facility may agree to additional terms or conditions that may be incorporated into the facility's plan.</strong></p>
<pre><code>    iv.(A) **Except as provided in (f)(iv)(C) of this subsection, if the department grants an application to a facility that already employs best available technology, it must award no cost allowances equal to 100 percent of the facility's carbon intensity or mass-based baseline for each year of the compliance period their application concerned.**
</code></pre>
<p>(B) <strong>Except as provided in (f)(iv)(C) of this subsection, if the department grants an application to a facility that is not employing best available technology, the department must award no cost allowances equal to 100 percent of the facility's emissions as projected under the best available technology plan for each year of the compliance period their application concerned.</strong></p>
<p>(C) <strong>Notwithstanding (f)(iv)(A) and (B) of this subsection, allowances awarded pursuant to (f)(iv)(A) and (B) of this subsection must not exceed the quantity of free allowances the facility otherwise received, or otherwise would have received, for the year beginning January 1, 2035.</strong></p>
<pre><code>v. **A facility's application seeking an upwards adjustment in the allocation of no cost allowances, and any determination by the department, is only valid for the compliance period it was submitted concerning. A facility that has received an upwards adjustment in the allocation of no cost allowances must reapply for an upwards adjustment prior to the beginning of any subsequent compliance period but may rely on a previously approved application as the basis of their best available technology application to the department for any components of best available technology or the best available technology plan that have not changed since the plan was last approved by the department.**

vi. **A facility that has received an upwards adjustment in the allocation of no cost allowances based upon a detailed and credible plan to employ best available technology, but has failed to employ best available technology consistent with the deployment schedule required in the plan:**
</code></pre>
<p>(A) <strong>Is subject to enforcement and penalties under RCW 70A.65.200(2) for a failure to submit sufficient compliance instruments for every additional allowance that it received pursuant to the upwards adjustment; and</strong></p>
<p>(B) <strong>May not apply for, or receive, any upwards adjustment in the allocation of no cost allowances in any subsequent compliance period.</strong></p>
<pre><code>vii. **Pursuant to RCW 43.21B.110(1)(o), a person may appeal a decision by the department to approve or not approve an upwards adjustment in the allocation of no cost allowances under this subsection.**

g. **Any adjustment granted pursuant to (f) of this subsection may not:**

    i. **Increase the annual allowance budget for the program under RCW 70A.65.070 for any calendar year in the compliance period for which the adjustment was granted or for any future calendar year;**

    ii. **Reduce the progressively equivalent reductions year over year in the annual allowance budgets under RCW 70A.65.070; or**

    iii. **Prevent the achievement of the emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, as those limits apply to this chapter.**

<p>If the actual emissions of an emissions-intensive, trade- exposed facility exceed the facility's no cost allowances assigned for that compliance period, it must acquire additional compliance instruments such that the total compliance instruments transferred to its compliance account consistent with chapter 316, Laws of 2021 equals emissions during the compliance period. An emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility must be allowed to bank unused allowances, including for future sale and investment in best available technology when economically feasible. The department shall limit the use of offset credits for compliance by an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility, such that the quantity of no cost allowances plus the provision of offset credits does not exceed 100 percent of the facility's total compliance obligation over a compliance period.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>The department must withhold or withdraw the relevant share of allowances allocated to a covered entity under this section in the event that the covered entity ceases production in the state and becomes a closed facility. In the event an entity curtails all production and becomes a curtailed facility, the allowances are retained but cannot be traded, sold, or transferred and are still subject to the emission reduction requirements specified in this section. An owner or operator of a curtailed facility may transfer the allowances to a new operator of the facility that will be operated under the same North American industry classification system codes. If the curtailed facility becomes a closed facility, then all unused allowances will be transferred to the emissions containment reserve. A curtailed facility is not eligible to receive free allowances during a period of curtailment. Any allowances withheld or withdrawn under this subsection must be transferred to the emissions containment reserve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An owner or operator of more than one facility receiving no cost allowances under this section may transfer allowances among the eligible facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules adopted by the department under this section must include protocols for allocating allowances at no cost to an eligible facility built after July 25, 2021. The protocols must include consideration of the products and criteria pollutants being produced by the facility, as well as the local environmental and health impacts associated with the facility. For a facility that is built on tribal lands or is determined by the department to impact tribal lands and resources, the protocols must be developed in consultation with the affected tribal nations.</p>
