<li>
<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The continued economic vitality of downtown and neighborhood commercial districts in our state's cities is essential to community preservation, social cohesion, and economic growth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In recent years there has been a deterioration of downtown and neighborhood commercial districts in both rural and urban communities due to a shifting population base, changes in the marketplace, and greater competition from suburban shopping malls, discount centers, and business transacted through the internet;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This decline has eroded the ability of businesses and property owners to renovate and enhance their commercial and residential properties; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business owners in these districts need to maintain their local economies in order to provide goods and services to adjacent residents, to provide employment opportunities, to avoid disinvestment and economic dislocations, and to develop and sustain downtown and neighborhood commercial district revitalization programs to address these problems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish a program to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Work in partnership with these organizations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide technical assistance and training to local governments, business organizations, downtown and neighborhood commercial district organizations, and business and property owners to accomplish community and economic revitalization and development of business districts; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certify a downtown or neighborhood commercial district organization's use of available tax incentives.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Develop objective criteria for selecting recipients of assistance under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, which shall include priority for downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization programs located in a rural county as defined in *RCW 43.160.020(12), and provide for designation of local programs under RCW 43.360.030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operate the Washington main street program in accordance with the plan developed by the department, in consultation with the Washington main street advisory committee created under **RCW 43.360.040; and</p>

<li>
<p>The department <strong>must</strong> adopt criteria for the designation of local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization programs and official local main street programs. In establishing the criteria, the department <strong>must</strong> consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The degree of interest and commitment to comprehensive downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization and, where applicable, historic preservation by both the public and private sectors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence of potential private sector investment in the downtown or neighborhood commercial district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where applicable, a downtown or neighborhood commercial district with sufficient historic fabric to become a foundation for an enhanced community image; <strong>and</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>d.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other factors the department deems necessary for the designation of a local program.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>In addition to the criteria in subsection (1) of this section, when adopting criteria for the designation of a program defined in RCW 82.73.010(6)(a), the department must consider:</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>The capacity of the organization to undertake a comprehensive program and the financial commitment to implement a long-term downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization program that includes a commitment to employ a professional program manager and maintain a sufficient operating budget;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The department's existing downtown revitalization program's tier system; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The national main street center's criteria for designating official main street cities.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department <strong>must</strong> designate local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization programs and official local main street programs. The programs <strong>must</strong> be limited to three categories of designation, one of which <strong>must</strong> be the main street level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW <strong>43.360.020</strong> does not apply to any local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization program unless the boundaries of the program have been identified and approved by the department. The boundaries of a local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization program are typically defined using the pedestrian core of a traditional commercial district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not designate a local downtown or neighborhood commercial district revitalization program or official local main street program if the program is undertaken by a local government with a population of one hundred ninety thousand persons or more.</p>
