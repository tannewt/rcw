<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.html">59.21.005</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislature recognizes that it is quite costly for tenants who own homes in manufactured/mobile home parks to relocate when the park in which they reside is closed or converted to another use. Many such tenants need financial assistance in order to relocate from a manufactured/mobile home park. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a mechanism for assisting manufactured/mobile home tenants to relocate their manufactured/mobile homes to suitable alternative sites or <strong>to</strong> secure <strong>alternative</strong> housing <strong>of their choice</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-2448">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2448">¶</a></h2>

<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.html">59.21.021</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If a manufactured/mobile home park is closed or converted to another use, eligible tenants shall be entitled to relocation assistance on a first-come, first-serve basis. The department shall give priority for distribution of relocation assistance to eligible tenants residing in parks that are closed as a result of park-owner fraud or as a result of health and safety concerns as determined by the local board of health. Payments shall be made upon the department's verification of eligibility, subject to the availability of remaining funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligibility for relocation assistance funds is limited to low-income households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible tenants who relocate are entitled to financial assistance from the fund, up to a maximum of <strong>$16,000</strong> for a multisection home and up to a maximum of <strong>$10,000</strong> for a single-section home. The department shall distribute relocation assistance for each eligible tenant</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>in the form of cash assistance to help the tenant secure <strong>alternative</strong> housing</p>
<p>.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Within 60 days of receiving financial assistance as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the tenant must either transfer title of the manufactured/mobile home to the park-owner or secure relocation of the home.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>Eligible tenants who transfer title of the home to the park-owner and whose household adjusted income is less than 50 percent of the median family income, adjusted for household size, for the county where the manufactured/mobile home is located, shall receive the maximum relocation assistance permitted per home size.</strong></p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p><strong>When the tenant transfers title to the park-owner, the department shall provide additional assistance to the park-owner for demolition and disposal of the manufactured/mobile home up to $4,000 for a multisection home and $2,500 for a single-section home.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To receive the assistance for demolition and disposal, the park-owner must demonstrate that the park-owner has incurred or contracted to incur expenses associated with demolishing the home.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eligible tenants who transfer title of the home to the park-owner and whose household adjusted income is more than 50 percent of the median family income, adjusted for household size, for the county where the manufactured/mobile home is located, shall receive 85 percent of the relocation assistance permitted per home size. The department shall provide the remaining 15 percent of the relocation assistance to the park-owner for demolition and disposal of the home after the park-owner has demonstrated that he or she has incurred or contracted to incur expenses associated with demolishing the home.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eligible tenants who secure relocation of the home and do not transfer title to the park-owner shall receive the maximum relocation assistance permitted, regardless of household adjusted income.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any individual or organization may apply to receive <strong>relocation assistance</strong> from the fund, for use in combination with funds from public or private sources, toward relocation of tenants eligible under this section, with agreement from the tenant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends the cash assistance provided under
subsection (3) of this section to be considered a one-time
direct grant payment that shall be excluded from household income
calculations for purposes of determining the eligibility of the
recipient for benefits or assistance under any state program financed
in whole or in part with state funds.</p>
