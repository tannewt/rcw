<p>Within thirty days after the issuance of the certificate of organization, unless the time is extended by the commission, petitions shall be filed with the commission to nominate candidates for the three elected supervisors. The petition shall be signed by not less than twenty-five district electors, and a district elector may sign petitions nominating more than one person.</p>
<p>In the case of a new district, the commission shall give due notice to elect the three supervisors. All provisions pertaining to elections on the creation of a district shall govern this election so far as applicable. The names of all nominees shall appear on the ballot in alphabetical order, together with instructions to vote for three. The three candidates receiving the most votes shall be declared elected supervisors. <strong>Terms of office for the initial supervisors are specified in section 2 of this act.</strong> An alternate method of dividing the district into three zones may be used when requested by the board of supervisors and approved by the commission. In such case, instructions will be to vote for one in each zone. The candidate receiving the most votes in a zone shall be declared elected.</p>
<p><strong>After</strong> the creation of the first board of supervisors, <strong>supervisor terms of office shall be four years. An election shall be held every other year in odd-numbered years. In each odd-numbered year after the creation of the first board of supervisors,</strong> the board shall by resolution and by giving due notice, set a date during the <strong>month identified by the conservation commission within which all conservation district elections shall be held</strong>. Names of candidates nominated by petition shall appear in alphabetical order on the ballots, together with an extra line wherein may be written in the name of any other candidate. The commission shall establish procedures for elections, canvass the returns and announce the official results thereof. Election results may be announced by polling officials at the close of the election subject to official canvass of ballots by the commission. Supervisors elected shall take office at the first board meeting following the election.</p>
<p><strong>A district board of supervisors may choose to conduct the election of supervisors subject to Title 29A RCW. Such change by the district board of supervisors must be made by a vote of a majority of the district supervisors following public notice and a hearing on the proposal. The district must notify the commission of the proposed motion and public notice of the action. In the event a district chooses to conduct the election subject to Title 29A RCW, rules and guidance developed by the commission for the conduct of supervisor elections do not apply and the district must comply with all provisions of Title 29A RCW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conservation district supervisors may choose to remove the district election from the Title 29A RCW process and revert to the commission election process by a majority vote of the supervisors. Such vote shall not take place until at least six years has passed since the district supervisors have passed a resolution to conduct supervisor elections consistent with Title 29A RCW.</strong></p>
