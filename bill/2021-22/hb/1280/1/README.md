The legislature hereby finds:

1. That major publicly owned or leased facilities have a significant impact on our state's consumption of energy **and emission of greenhouse gases from the buildings sector**;

2. That energy conservation practices including energy management systems, combined heat and power systems, and renewable energy systems adopted for the design, construction, and utilization of such facilities will have a beneficial effect on our overall supply of energy;

3. That the beneficial effect of the electric output from combined heat and power systems includes both energy and capacity value;

4. That the cost of the energy consumed by such facilities**, and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with that energy consumption,** over the life of the facilities shall be considered in addition to the initial cost of constructing such facilities;

5. That the cost of energy is significant and major facility designs shall be based on the total life-cycle cost, including the initial construction cost, and the cost, over the economic life of a major facility, of the energy consumed, and of the operation and maintenance of a major facility as they affect energy consumption**, including the costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption**; and

6. That the use of energy systems in these facilities which utilize combined heat and power or renewable resources such as solar energy, wood or wood waste, or other nonconventional fuels, and which incorporate energy management systems, shall be considered in the design of all publicly owned or leased facilities.


## Section 2
