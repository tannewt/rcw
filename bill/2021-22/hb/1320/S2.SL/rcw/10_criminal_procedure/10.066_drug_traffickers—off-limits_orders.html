<p>The legislature finds that drug abuse is escalating at an alarming rate. New protections need to be established to address this drug crisis which is threatening every stratum of our society. Prohibiting known drug traffickers from frequenting areas for continuous drug activity is one means of addressing this pervasive problem.</p>

<p>Upon the filing of an application for an off-limits order under RCW 10.66.020 (1), (2), or (3), the court shall set a hearing fourteen days from the filing of the application, or as soon thereafter as the hearing can be scheduled.

<p>Upon filing an application for an off-limits order under this chapter, an applicant may obtain an ex parte temporary off-limits order, with or without notice, only upon a showing that serious or irreparable harm will result to the applicant if the temporary off-limits order is not granted.

A hearing on a one-year off-limits order, as provided in this chapter, shall be set for fourteen days from the issuance of the temporary order. The respondent shall be personally served with a copy of the temporary off-limits order along with a copy of the application and notice of the date set for the full hearing. At the hearing, if the court finds that respondent is a known drug trafficker who has engaged in drug trafficking in a particular area, and that the area is associated with a pattern of drug activities, the court shall issue a one-year off-limits order prohibiting the respondent from having any contact with the PADT area. At any time within three months before the expiration of the order, the applicant may apply for a renewal of the order by filing a new petition under this chapter.</p>

<p>In granting a temporary off-limits order or a one-year off-limits order, the court shall have discretion to grant additional relief as the court considers proper to achieve the purposes of this chapter. The PADT area defined in any off-limits order must be reasonably related to the area or areas impacted by the unlawful drug activity as described by the applicant in any civil action under RCW 10.66.020 (1), (2), or (3). The court in its discretion may allow a respondent, who is the subject of any order issued under RCW 10.66.020 as part of a civil or criminal proceeding, to enter an off-limits area or areas for health or employment reasons, subject to conditions prescribed by the court.
