<li>
<p>&quot;Commercial sex act&quot; means any act of sexual contact or sexual intercourse for which something of value is given or received.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Involuntary servitude&quot; means a condition of servitude in which the victim was forced to work by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, by the use of threat of coercion through law or legal process, or as set forth in RCW 9A.40.110.

Restraint is &quot;without consent&quot; if it is accomplished by (a) physical force, intimidation, or deception, or (b) any means including acquiescence of the victim, if he or she is a child less than sixteen years old or an incompetent person and if the parent, guardian, or other person or institution having lawful control or custody of him or her has not acquiesced.</p>

<p>In any prosecution of custodial interference in the first or second degree, it is a complete defense, if established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, that:</p>

<p>A defendant who is charged by citation, complaint, or information with an offense involving trafficking, as described in RCW 9A.40.100, and is not arrested, shall appear in court for arraignment or initial appearance in person as soon as practicable, but in no event later than fourteen days after the defendant is served with the citation, complaint, or information.
