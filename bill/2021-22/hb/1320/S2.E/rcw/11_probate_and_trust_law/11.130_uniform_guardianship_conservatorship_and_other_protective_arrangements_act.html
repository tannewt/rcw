<p>It is the intent of the legislature to protect the liberty and autonomy of all people of this state, and to enable them to exercise their rights under the law to the maximum extent, consistent with the capacity of each person. The legislature recognizes that people with incapacities have unique abilities and needs, and that some people with incapacities cannot exercise their rights or provide for their basic needs without the help of a guardian. However, their liberty and autonomy should be restricted through guardianship, conservatorship, emergency guardianship, emergency conservatorship, and other protective arrangements only to the minimum extent necessary to adequately provide for their own health or safety, or to adequately manage their financial affairs.</p>

<p>A standby guardian appointed under this section may act as guardian, with all duties and powers of a guardian under RCW 11.130.230 and 11.130.235, when no parent of the minor is willing or able to exercise the duties and powers granted to the guardian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A parent of a minor, in a signed record, may nominate a person to be appointed by the court as standby guardian for the minor. The parent, in a signed record, may state desired limitations on the powers to be granted the standby guardian. The parent, in a signed record, may revoke or amend the nomination at any time before the court appoints a standby guardian.</p>

<p>A person entitled to notice under subsection (5) of this section, not later than sixty days after service of the petition and statement, may object to appointment of the standby guardian by filing an objection with the court and giving notice of the objection to each other person entitled to notice under subsection (5) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an objection is filed under subsection (7) of this section, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether a standby guardian should be appointed and, if so, the person that should be appointed. If no objection is filed, the court may make the appointment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may not grant a petition for a standby guardian of the minor if notice substantially complying with subsection (5) of this section is not served on:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The minor, if the minor is twelve years of age or older; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each parent of the minor, unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent, in a record, waived the right to notice or cannot be located and served with due diligence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a petitioner is unable to serve notice under subsection (5) of this section on a parent of the minor or alleges that a parent of the minor waived the right to notice under this section, the court shall appoint a court visitor who shall:</p>

<p>If the court finds under subsection (3) of this section that a standby guardian should be appointed, the following rules apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The court shall appoint the person nominated under subsection (2) of this section unless the court finds the appointment is contrary to the best interest of the minor.</p>

<li>
<p>Each parent of the minor, unless the parent, in a record, waived the right to notice or cannot be located and served with due diligence;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A person that receives notice under subsection (13) of this section or any other person interested in the welfare of the minor may file with the court an objection to the standby guardian's assumption of duties and powers of a guardian.

<p>Appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent substantial harm to the minor's health, safety, or welfare; and</p>

Not later than five days after the appointment, the court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.</p>

<p>On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may:</p>

<li>
<p>Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements for physical health, safety, or self-care because the respondent is unable to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision making;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointment is necessary to prevent significant risk of harm to the adult respondent's physical health, safety, or self-care; and</p>

<p>The respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative; or</p>

<li>
<p>The court shall grant a guardian appointed under subsection (1) of this section only those powers necessitated by the demonstrated needs and limitations of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage development of the respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The court may not establish a full guardianship if a limited guardianship, protective arrangement instead of guardianship, or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the respondent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A determination by the court that a basis exists under subsection (1) of this section for the appointment of a guardian and on the issue of the rights that will be retained or restricted by the appointment of a guardian is a legal decision, not a medical decision. The determination must be based on a demonstration of management insufficiencies over time in the area of physical health, safety, or self-care. Age, eccentricity, poverty, or medical diagnosis alone are not sufficient basis under subsection (1) of this section to justify a determination that a guardian should be appointed for the respondent.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The court visitor shall within two days of service of notice of appointment file with the court and serve, either personally or by certified mail with return receipt, the respondent or the respondent's legal counsel, the petitioner or the petitioner's legal counsel, and any notice party with a statement including the court visitor's: Training relating to the duties as a court visitor; criminal history as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 for the period covering ten years prior to the appointment; hourly rate, if compensated; contact, if any, with a party to the proceeding prior to appointment; and apparent or actual conflicts of interest.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A guardian for an adult is a fiduciary and owes the highest duty of good faith and care to the person under a guardianship. The guardian shall not substitute his or her moral or religious values, opinions, or philosophical beliefs for those of the person under a guardianship. Except as otherwise limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make decisions regarding the support, care, education, health, and welfare of the adult subject to guardianship to the extent necessitated by the adult's limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of the adult and, to the extent reasonably feasible, encourage the adult to participate in decisions, act on the adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the adult's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular visitation, to know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities, and physical and mental health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the adult, including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities, or social interactions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive relationships and services for the adult.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable care, diligence, and prudence when acting on behalf of or making decisions for the adult. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Take reasonable care of the personal effects, pets, and service or support animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a conservatorship or protective arrangement instead of conservatorship if necessary to protect the adult's property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expend funds and other property of the adult received by the guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education, health, and welfare;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conserve any funds and other property of the adult not expended under (b) of this subsection for the adult's future needs, but if a conservator has been appointed for the adult, pay the funds and other property at least quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the adult's future needs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor the quality of services, including long-term care services, provided to the adult.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the adult would make if the adult were able unless doing so would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject to guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's previous or current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under subsection (4) of this section because the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine the decision the adult probably would make if able, or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with the best interests of the adult. In determining the best interests of the adult, the guardian shall consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Information received from professionals and persons that demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other information the guardian believes the adult would have considered if the adult were able to act; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult would consider, including consequences for others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A guardian for an adult immediately shall notify the court if the condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising rights previously removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guardian shall file with the court within thirty days of any substantial change in the condition of the person under guardianship or any changes in the residence of the person under guardianship and shall provide a copy of the notice to the adult subject to guardianship, a person entitled to notice under RCW 11.130.310(5) or a subsequent order, and any other person the court has determined is entitled to notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To inform any person entitled to notice under RCW 11.130.310(5) or a subsequent order, and any other person the court has determined is entitled to notice, but in no case more than five business days, after the person subject to guardianship:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Makes a change in residence that is intended or likely to last more than fourteen calendar days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has been admitted to a medical facility for acute care in response to a life-threatening injury or medical condition that requires inpatient care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has been treated in an emergency room setting or kept for hospital observation for more than twenty-four hours; or</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection (2) or (3) of this section, the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be in accordance with the adult's preferences, values, and prior directions and whether the underlying act would be in the adult's best interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (1)(b) of this section to establish the adult's place of dwelling, the guardian shall:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult would select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-making standard in RCW 11.130.325 (4) and (5). If the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine what setting the adult subject to guardianship probably would choose if able, or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the adult, the guardian shall choose in accordance with RCW 11.130.325(5) a residential setting that is consistent with the adult's best interest;</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, an adult subject to a guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangement retains the right to associate with other persons of the adult's choosing. This right includes, but is not limited to, the right to freely communicate and interact with other persons, whether through in-person visits, telephone calls, electronic communication, personal mail, or other means. If the adult subject to a guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangement is unable to express consent for communication, visitation, or interaction with another person, or is otherwise unable to make a decision regarding association with another person, the guardian, conservator, or person acting under a protective arrangement, whether full or limited, must:</p>

<p>The restriction is specifically authorized by the court in the court order establishing or modifying the guardianship or limited guardianship, the conservatorship or limited conservatorship, or the protective arrangement under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The restriction is pursuant to a protection order issued under chapter <strong>7.---</strong> RCW (the new chapter created in section 78 of this act), or other law, that limits contact between the adult under a guardianship, conservatorship, or other protective arrangement and other persons;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>iii.(A) The guardian or limited guardian, the conservator or limited conservator, or the person acting under the protective arrangement has good cause to believe that there is an immediate need to restrict the adult's right to communicate, visit, interact, or otherwise associate with persons of the adult's choosing in order to protect the adult from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or financial exploitation, as those terms are defined in RCW 74.34.020, or to protect the adult from activities that unnecessarily impose significant distress on the adult; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Within fourteen calendar days of imposing the restriction under (b)(iii)(A) of this subsection, the guardian or limited guardian, the conservator or limited conservator, or <strong>the</strong> person acting under the protective arrangement files a petition for a <strong>vulnerable adult</strong> protection order under chapter <strong>7.---</strong> RCW (the new chapter created in section 78 of this act). The immediate need restriction may remain in place until the court has heard and issued an order or decision on the petition; or</p>

<p>The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated by demonstrated limitations and needs of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage development of the respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The court may not establish a full conservatorship if a limited conservatorship, protective arrangement instead of conservatorship, or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the respondent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A determination by the court that a basis under subsection (2) of this section exists for the appointment of a conservator for an adult and on the issue of the rights that will be retained or restricted by the appointment of a conservator is a legal, not a medical decision. The determination must be based on demonstrated management insufficiencies over time in the area of property or financial affairs. Age, eccentricity, poverty, or medical diagnosis alone are not a sufficient basis under subsection (2) of this section to justify a determination that a conservator should be appointed for the respondent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of subsection (2) of this section, an adult who resides in a long-term care facility, resides in another care setting, or is the subject of an involuntary commitment order is not considered missing or detained.</p>

<p>Have authority to disburse or commit those funds under the control of the conservator as are prudent and within the means of the estate for the disposition of the deceased individual subject to conservatorship's remains. Consent for such arrangement must be secured according to RCW 68.50.160. If no person authorized by RCW 68.50.160 accepts responsibility for giving consent, the conservator may consent, subject to the provisions of this section and to the known directives of the deceased individual subject to conservatorship. Reasonable financial commitments made by a conservator pursuant to this section are binding against the estate of the deceased individual subject to conservatorship;</p>

<li>
<p>If forty days after the death of an individual subject to conservatorship no personal representative has been appointed and no application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative to administer and distribute the decedent's estate. The conservator shall give notice of his or her appointment and the pendency of any probate proceedings as provided in RCW 11.28.237 and shall also give notice to a person nominated as personal representative by a will of the decedent of which the conservator is aware. The court may grant the application if there is no objection and endorse the letters of office to note that the individual formerly subject to conservatorship is deceased and the conservator has acquired the powers and duties of a personal representative.</p>

<p>A conservator may pay, or secure by encumbering property included in the conservatorship estate, a claim against the conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship arising before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and allowance in accordance with the priorities under subsection (4) of this section. A claimant may present a claim by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court, and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claim under subsection (1) of this section is presented on receipt by the conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of the claim, whichever first occurs. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed in whole or in part by the conservator in a record sent or delivered to the claimant not later than sixty days after its presentation. Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls until thirty days after disallowance of the claim the running of a statute of limitations that has not expired relating to the claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claimant whose claim under subsection (1) of this section has not been paid may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is barred by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment, or security by encumbering property included in the conservatorship estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual subject to conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the conservatorship estate.</p>

<p>Costs and expenses of administration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claim of the federal or state government having priority under law other than this chapter;</p>

<li>
<p>A claim arising before the conservatorship; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All other claims.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under subsection (4) of this section over another claim of the same class. A claim due and payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without sufficient funds to pay the basic living and health care expenses of the individual subject to conservatorship; and</p>

<p>Note to petitioner: This form can be used to petition for a guardian, conservator, or both, or for a protective arrangement instead of either a guardianship or conservatorship. This form should not be used to petition for guardianship for a minor.</p>
<p>The court may appoint a guardian or order a protective arrangement instead of guardianship for an adult if the adult lacks the ability to meet essential requirements for physical health, safety, or self-care because (1) the adult is unable to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions even with the use of supportive services, technological assistance, and supported decision making, and (2) the adult's identified needs cannot be met by a less restrictive alternative.</p>
<p>The court may appoint a conservator or order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for an adult if (1) the adult is unable to manage property and financial affairs because of a limitation in the ability to receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions even with the use of supportive services, technological assistance, and supported decision making or the adult is missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States, and (2) appointment is necessary to avoid harm to the adult or significant dissipation of the property of the adult, or to obtain or provide funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the adult, or of an individual who is entitled to the adult's support, and protection is necessary or desirable to provide funds or other property for that purpose.</p>
<p>The court may appoint a conservator or order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for a minor if: (1) The minor owns funds or other property requiring management or protection that cannot otherwise be provided; or (2) it would be in the minor's best interests, and the minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at unreasonable risk or hindered because of the minor's age, or appointment is necessary or desirable to provide funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the minor.</p>
<p>The court may also order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship that restricts access to an individual or an individual's property by a person that the court finds: (1) Through fraud, coercion, duress, or the use of deception and control, caused, or attempted to cause, an action that would have resulted in financial harm to the individual or the individual's property; and (2) poses a serious risk of substantial financial harm to the individual or the individual's property.</p>

<p>Notification of Rights</p>
<p>You are getting this notice because a guardian, conservator, or both have been appointed for you. It tells you about some important rights you have. It does not tell you about all your rights. If you have questions about your rights, you can ask an attorney or another person, including your guardian or conservator, to help you understand your rights.</p>
<p>General rights:</p>
<p>You have the right to exercise any right the court has not given to your guardian or conservator.</p>
<p>You also have the right to ask the court to:</p>
<p>End your guardianship, conservatorship, or both;</p>
<p>Increase or decrease the powers granted to your guardian, conservator, or both;</p>
<p>Make other changes that affect what your guardian or conservator can do or how they do it; and</p>
<p>Replace the person that was appointed with someone else.</p>
<p>You also have a right to hire an attorney to help you do any of these things.</p>

<p>Be involved in decisions about your health care to the extent reasonably feasible, and to have other people help you understand the risks and benefits of health care options;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be notified at least fourteen days in advance of a change in where you live or a permanent move to a nursing home, mental health facility, or other facility that places restrictions on your ability to leave or have visitors, unless the guardian has proposed this change in the guardian's plan or the court has expressly authorized it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask the court to prevent your guardian from changing where you live or selling or surrendering your primary dwelling by following the appropriate process for objecting to such a move in compliance with RCW 11.130.330(5);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vote and get married unless the court order appointing your guardian states that you cannot do so;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate, visit, or interact with other people (this includes the right to have visitors, to make and receive telephone calls, personal mail, or electronic communications) unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Your guardian has been authorized by the court by specific order to restrict these communications, visits, or interactions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A protective order is in effect that limits contact between you and other people; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your guardian has good cause to believe the restriction is needed to protect you from significant physical, psychological, or financial harm and the restriction is for not more than seven business days if the person has a relative or preexisting social relationship with you or not more than sixty days if the person does not have that kind of relationship with you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional rights for persons for whom a conservator has been appointed:</p>
<p>As an adult subject to conservatorship, you have a right to:</p>
<p>Participate in decisions about how your property is managed to the extent feasible; and</p>
<p>Receive a copy of your conservator's inventory, report, and plan.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The certified professional guardianship board must resolve grievances against professional guardians and/or conservators within a reasonable time for alleged violations of the certified professional guardianship board's standards of practice, statutes, regulations, or rules, that relate to the conduct of a certified professional guardian or conservator.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All grievances must initially be reviewed within thirty days by certified professional guardianship board members, or a subset thereof, to determine if the grievance is complete, states facts that describe a violation of the standards of practice, statutes, regulations, or rules, and relates to the conduct of a professional guardian and/or conservator, before investigating, requesting a response from the professional guardian or conservator, or forwarding to the superior courts. To be complete, grievances must provide sufficient details of the alleged conduct to demonstrate that a violation of the statute, regulation, standard of practice, or rule, relating to the conduct of a certified professional guardian or conservator could have occurred, the dates the alleged conduct occurred, and must be signed and dated by the person filing the grievance. Grievance investigations by the board are limited to the allegations contained in the grievance unless, after review by a majority of the members of the certified professional guardianship board, further investigation is justified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the certified professional guardianship board determines the grievance is complete, states facts that allege a violation of the certified professional guardianship board's standards of practice, and relates to the conduct of a professional guardian and/or conservator, the certified professional guardianship board must forward that grievance within ten days to the superior court for that guardianship or conservatorship and to the professional guardian and/or conservator. The court must review the matter as set forth in RCW 11.130.140, and must direct the clerk of the court to send a copy of the order entered under this section to the certified professional guardianship board. The certified professional guardianship board must accept as facts any finding of fact contained in the order. The certified professional guardianship board must act consistently with any finding of fact issued in that order.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grievances received by the certified professional guardianship board must be investigated and the resolution determined and in process within one hundred eighty days of receipt. The one hundred eighty days is tolled during any period of time when:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The certified professional guardianship board has provided a certified professional guardian or conservator an opportunity to respond to a grievance against the certified professional guardian or conservator and the certified professional guardianship board is awaiting the certified professional guardian or conservator's response;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The certified professional guardianship board has forwarded a grievance to the superior court for review under subsection (1)(b) of this section and is awaiting receipt of the court's entered order with findings; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A certified professional guardianship board disciplinary hearing has been requested or is in process and during the time of posthearing board review of the hearing officer's recommendations through issuance of a final certified professional guardianship board's order on the matter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the grievance cannot be resolved within one hundred eighty days, the certified professional guardianship board must notify the professional guardian and/or conservator. The professional guardian or conservator may propose a resolution of the grievance with facts and/or arguments. The certified professional guardianship board may accept the proposed resolution or determine that an additional ninety days are needed to review the grievance. If the certified professional guardianship board has not resolved the grievance within the additional ninety days the professional guardian or conservator may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>File a motion for a court order to compel the certified professional guardianship board to resolve the grievance within a reasonable time; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move for the superior court to resolve the grievance instead of being resolved by the certified professional guardianship board.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superior court has authority to enforce the certified professional guardianship board's standards of practice in this article to the extent those standards are related to statutory or fiduciary duties of guardians and conservators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any unresolved grievances filed with the certified professional guardianship board one year or more before January 1, 2022, must be forwarded to the superior court for that guardianship or conservatorship for review by the superior court as set forth in RCW 11.130.140 if the grievance is not in process of a hearing or final resolution.</p>
