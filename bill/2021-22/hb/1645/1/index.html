<p>The outdated medicaid payment methodology was replaced by the 2018 legislature with a new payment system that is based on prevalent wages supported by verifiable, public data and the hours of care needed for each resident's acuity according to a time study conducted by the department of social and health services. While it was intended that the model be fully phased-in, the legislature finds that this methodology is currently only phased-in to 60 percent and that medicaid payments for wages have fallen below the state minimum wage. Assisted living contractors that provide care for medicaid clients are unable to hire and retain the necessary workforce. As employers to thousands of nursing staff who are over 40 percent nonwhite or foreign born and predominately older females, it is essential that these providers are able to keep up with prevailing wages. The legislature also recognizes that the population aged 79 and older is growing rapidly and it is critical to update state policies including provider payment rates to ensure the availability of enrolled medicaid providers is sufficient to serve the number of beneficiaries who wish to remain within geographic proximity to their own community. The legislature finds assisted living is a valued partner in providing care to Washington state's low-income elderly populations and, as such, intends to formalize the medicaid payment methodology phase-in schedule.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/74_public_assistance/74.39A_long-term_care_services_options%E2%80%94expansion.html">74.39A.032</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/74_public_assistance/74.39A_long-term_care_services_options%E2%80%94expansion.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish in rule a new medicaid payment system for contracted assisted living, adult residential care, and enhanced adult residential care. Beginning July 1, 2019, payments for these contracts must be based on the new methodology which must be phased-in to <strong>77 percent of the fully funded model by July 1, 2022, and to 85 percent of the fully funded model by July 1, 2023. Full</strong> implementation <strong>must be achieved by July 1, 2026,</strong> according to funding made available by the legislature for this purpose. The new payment system must have these components: Client care, operations, and room and board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client care is the labor component of the system and must include variables to recognize the time and intensity of client care and services, staff wages, and associated fringe benefits. The wage variable in the client care component must be adjusted according to service areas based on labor costs.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The time variable is used to weight the client care payment to client acuity and must be scaled according to the classification levels utilized in the department's assessment tool. The initial system shall establish a variable for time using the residential care time study conducted in 2001 and the department's corresponding estimate of the average staff hours per client by job position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wage variable shall include recognition of staff positions needed to perform the functions required by contract, including nursing services. Data used to establish the wage variable must be adjusted so that no baseline wage is below the state minimum in effect at the time of implementation. The wage variable is a blended wage based on the federal bureau of labor statistics wage data and the distribution of time according to staff position. Blended wages are established for each county and then counties are arrayed from highest to lowest. Service areas are established and the median blended wage in each service area becomes the wage variable for all the assigned counties in that service area. The system must have no less than two service areas, one of which shall be a high labor cost service area and shall include counties at or above the ninety-fifth percentile in the array of blended wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fringe benefit variable recognizes employee benefits and payroll taxes. The factor to calculate the percentage of fringe benefits shall be established using the statewide nursing facility cost ratio of benefits and payroll taxes to in-house wages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The operations component must recognize costs that are allowable under federal medicaid rules for the federal matching percentage. The operations component is calculated at ninety percent or greater of the statewide median nursing facility costs associated with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Supplies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonlabor administrative expenses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff education and in-service training; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational overhead including licenses, insurance, and business and <strong>occupation</strong> taxes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The room and board component recognizes costs that do not qualify for federal financial participation under medicaid rules by compensating providers for the medicaid client's share of raw food and shelter costs including expenses related to the physical plant such as property taxes, property and liability insurance, debt service, and major capital repairs. The room and board component is subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsections (2) and (3) of this section establish the rate for medicaid covered services. Subsection (4) of this section establishes the rate for nonmedicaid covered services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rates paid on July 1, 2019, shall be based on data from the 2016 calendar year, except for the time variable under subsection (2)(a) of this section. The client care and operations components must be rebased in even-numbered years. Beginning with rates paid on July 1, 2020, wages, benefits and taxes, and operations costs shall be rebased using 2018 data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2020, the room and board component shall be updated annually subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.</p>
</li>
