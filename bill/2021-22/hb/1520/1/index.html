<h2 id="section-1-3167">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3167">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had major negative economic impacts on businesses across the state. Reducing such impacts and helping businesses forced to close or operate at diminished capacity for extended periods of time is not only the compassionate and reasonable thing to do, but it is also in the best long-term interests of Washington's tax revenue production. As such, the legislature intends to allow shuttered businesses the opportunity to quickly earn back much needed lost revenue, improve their near-term capital liquidity and increase their short-term margins, and streamline their ability to compete and get back up to speed by removing the need to pay business and occupation taxes for a short period of time.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-2540">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2540">¶</a></h2>
