<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to update and adapt state tax policy to the forms of commerce that have emerged with new technologies. The legislature recognizes that consumers are increasingly conducting their professional and personal affairs online and on devices such as smartphones or tablets. These activities include applying for jobs, researching symptoms and communicating with health care providers, applying for permits and licenses, mapping routes, communicating with friends and family, consuming news and entertainment, and shopping and arranging for the delivery of goods and services to the home. Through these daily activities, consumers generate enormous and unprecedented quantities of data about themselves, including their locations, behaviors, and preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that technological advances have made it possible to more easily and quickly gather, analyze, and export vast amounts of personal information, whether such information is obtained through electronic or other means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that there are various businesses engaged in accumulating the personal data that is available to be collected on Washingtonians, aggregating or compiling that information, and reselling it without any compensation to the people of the state. This is a new business model that has flourished and is anticipated to grow as more people and more devices are connected with ever-increasing frequency for an ever greater number of innovative applications. As such, the legislature intends to have this unique and growing industry set apart with its own individual tax rate. This will provide transparency on the number of businesses and volume of activity in this industry, and fairly generate revenue to be used for the benefit of the state of Washington and its people.</p>

<p>The apportionable income of a person within the scope of RCW 82.04.460(1) is apportioned to Washington by multiplying its apportionable income by the receipts factor. Persons who are subject to tax under more than one of the tax classifications enumerated in RCW 82.04.460(4)(a) (i) through (xi) must calculate a separate receipts factor for each tax classification that the person is taxable under.</p>

<li>
<p>For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the receipts factor is a fraction and is calculated as provided in subsections (3) <strong>through (5)</strong> of this section and, for financial institutions, as provided in the rule adopted by the department under the authority of RCW 82.04.460(2).</p>

<li>
<p>If the customer received the benefit of the service or used the intangible property in more than one state and if the taxpayer is unable to attribute gross income of the business under the provisions of (b)(i) of this subsection (3), gross income of the business must be attributed to the state in which the benefit of the service was primarily received or in which the intangible property was primarily used.</p>

For purposes of this subsection (3)(c), &quot;not taxable&quot; means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that state, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a state in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with that state under the standards in RCW 82.04.067(1) regardless of whether that state imposes such a tax. &quot;Business activities tax&quot; means a tax measured by the amount of, or economic results of, business activity conducted in a state.

Financial institutions that are subject to tax under any other tax classification enumerated in RCW 82.04.460(4)(a) (i) through (v) and (vii) through (xi) must calculate a separate receipts factor, as provided in this section, for each of the other tax classifications that the financial institution is taxable under.</p>

<p>A taxpayer may calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year based on the most recent calendar year for which information is available for the full calendar year. If a taxpayer does not calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year based on previous calendar year information as authorized in this subsection, the business must use current year information to calculate the receipts factor for the current tax year. In either case, a taxpayer must correct the reporting for the current tax year when complete information is available to calculate the receipts factor for that year, but not later than October 31st of the following tax year. Interest will apply to any additional tax due on a corrected tax return. Interest must be computed and assessed as provided in RCW 82.32.050 and accrues until the additional taxes are paid. Penalties as provided in RCW 82.32.090 will apply to any such additional tax due only if the current tax year reporting is not corrected and the additional tax is not paid by October 31st of the following tax year. Interest as provided in RCW 82.32.060 will apply to any tax paid in excess of that properly due on a return as a result of a taxpayer using previous calendar year data or incomplete current-year data to calculate the receipts factor.</p>

<li>
<p>The director may grant a direct pay permit to a taxpayer who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the director, that the taxpayer meets the requirements of this section. The direct pay permit allows the taxpayer to accrue and remit directly to the department use tax on the acquisition of tangible personal property or sales tax on the sale of or charges made for labor and/or services, in accordance with all of the applicable provisions of this title. Any taxpayer that uses a direct pay permit must remit state and local sales or use tax directly to the department. The agreement by the purchaser to remit tax directly to the department, rather than pay sales or use tax to the seller, relieves the seller of the obligation to collect sales or use tax and requires the buyer to pay use tax on the tangible personal property and sales tax on the sale of or charges made for labor and/or services.</p>
</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A taxpayer may apply for a permit under this section if: (i) The taxpayer's cumulative tax liability is reasonably expected to be two hundred forty thousand dollars or more in the current calendar year; or (ii) the taxpayer makes purchases subject to the taxes imposed under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW in excess of ten million dollars per calendar year. For the purposes of this section, &quot;tax liability&quot; means the amount required to be remitted to the department for taxes administered under this chapter, except for the taxes imposed or authorized by chapters 82.14A, 82.14B, 82.24, 82.27, 82.29A, and 84.33 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application for a permit must be made in writing to the director in a form and manner prescribed by the department. A taxpayer who transacts business in two or more locations may submit one application to cover the multiple locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director must review a direct pay permit application in a timely manner and must notify the applicant, in writing, of the approval or denial of the application. The department must approve or deny an application based on the applicant's ability to comply with local government use tax coding capabilities and responsibilities; requirements for vendor notification; recordkeeping obligations; electronic data capabilities; and tax reporting procedures. Additionally, an application may be denied if the director determines that denial would be in the best interest of collecting taxes due under this title. The department must provide a direct pay permit to an approved applicant with the notice of approval. The direct pay permit must clearly state that the holder is solely responsible for the accrual and payment of the tax imposed under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW and that the seller is relieved of liability to collect tax imposed under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW on all sales to the direct pay permit holder. The taxpayer may petition the director for reconsideration of a denial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A taxpayer who uses a direct pay permit must continue to maintain records that are necessary to a determination of the tax liability in accordance with this title. A direct pay permit is not transferable and the use of a direct pay permit may not be assigned to a third party.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxes for which the direct pay permit is used are due and payable on the tax return for the reporting period in which the taxpayer (a) receives the tangible personal property purchased or in which the labor and/or services are performed or (b) receives an invoice for such property or such labor and/or services, whichever period is earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The holder of a direct pay permit must furnish a copy of the direct pay permit to each vendor with whom the taxpayer has opted to use a direct pay permit. Sellers who make sales upon which the sales or use tax is not collected by reason of the provisions of this section, in addition to existing requirements under this title, must maintain a copy of the direct pay permit and any such records or information as the department may specify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A direct pay permit is subject to revocation by the director at any time the department determines that the taxpayer has violated any provision of this section or that revocation would be in the best interests of collecting the taxes due under this title. The notice of revocation must be in writing and is effective either as of the end of the taxpayer's next normal reporting period or a date deemed appropriate by the director and identified in the revocation notice. The taxpayer may petition the director for reconsideration of a revocation and reinstatement of the permit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any taxpayer who chooses to no longer use a direct pay permit or whose permit is revoked by the department, must return the permit to the department and immediately make a good faith effort to notify all vendors to whom the permit was given, advising them that the permit is no longer valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in this subsection, the direct pay permit may be used for any purchase of tangible personal property and any retail sale under RCW 82.04.050. The direct pay permit may not be used for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Purchases of meals or beverages;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchases of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, airplanes, and other property subject to requirements for title transactions by the department of licensing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchases for which a reseller permit or other documentation authorized under RCW 82.04.470 may be used;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchases that meet the definitions of RCW 82.04.050 (2) (e) and (f), (3) (a) <strong>, (b), and (d) through (f)</strong>, (5), and (15); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other activities subject to tax under chapter 82.08 or 82.12 RCW that the department by rule designates, consistent with the purposes of this section, as activities for which a direct pay permit is not appropriate and may not be used.</p>
</li>
