<p>This act may be known and cited as the Washington foundational data privacy act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-2872">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2872">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the people of Washington regard their privacy as a fundamental right and an essential element of their individual freedom. Washington's Constitution explicitly provides the right to privacy, and fundamental privacy rights have long been and continue to be integral to protecting Washingtonians and to safeguarding our democratic republic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing advances in technology have produced an exponential growth in the volume and variety of personal data being generated, collected, stored, and analyzed, which presents both promise and potential peril. The ability to harness and use data in positive ways is driving innovation and brings beneficial technologies to society. However, it has also created risks to privacy and freedom. The unregulated and unauthorized use and disclosure of personal information and loss of privacy can have devastating impacts, ranging from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs, to personal time and finances, to destruction of property, harassment, reputational damage, emotional distress, and physical harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that technological innovation and new uses of data can help solve societal problems, protect public health associated with global pandemics, and improve quality of life, the legislature seeks to shape responsible public policies where innovation and protection of individual privacy coexist. The legislature notes that our federal authorities have not developed or adopted into law regulatory or legislative solutions that give consumers control over their privacy. In contrast, the European Union's general data protection regulation has continued to influence data privacy policies and practices of those businesses competing in global markets. In the absence of federal standards, Washington will join a growing number of states across the country to empower consumers to protect their privacy and require companies to be responsible custodians of data as they continue to innovate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With this act, the legislature intends to: Provide a modern privacy regulatory framework with data privacy guardrails to protect individual privacy; establish mechanisms for consumers to exercise control over their data; and require companies to be responsible custodians of data as technological innovations emerge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act gives consumers the ability to protect their own rights to privacy by explicitly providing consumers the right to access, correct, and delete personal data, as well as the rights to obtain data in a portable format and to opt out of or into the collection and use of personal data for certain purposes. These rights will add to, and not subtract from, the consumer protection rights that consumers already have under Washington state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act also imposes affirmative obligations upon companies to safeguard personal data, and provide clear, understandable, and transparent information to consumers about how their personal data is used. It strengthens compliance and accountability by requiring data protection assessments in the collection and use of personal data. It empowers the state attorney general to obtain and evaluate a company's data protection assessments, to conduct investigations, while preserving consumers' rights under the consumer protection act to impose penalties where violations occur, and to prevent against future violations. Finally, it creates a new privacy commission to regulate how businesses process and control consumer data.</p>

<p>Processors are responsible under this chapter for adhering to the instructions of the controller and assisting the controller to meet its obligations under this chapter. This assistance includes the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Taking into account the nature of the processing, the processor shall assist the controller by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the controller's obligation to respond to consumer requests to exercise their rights pursuant to section 5 of this act; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, the processor shall: Assist the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of the security of the system pursuant to RCW 19.255.010; and provide information to the controller necessary to enable the controller to conduct and document any data protection assessments required by section 11 of this act. The controller and processor are each responsible for only the measures allocated to them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the instructions of the controller, a processor shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Ensure that each person processing the personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage a subcontractor only after providing the controller with an opportunity to object and pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection (5) of this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account the context of processing, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and establish a clear allocation of the responsibilities between them to implement such measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processing by a processor must be governed by a contract between the controller and the processor that is binding on both parties and that sets out the processing instructions to which the processor is bound, including the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data subject to the processing, the duration of the processing, and the obligations and rights of both parties. In addition, the contract must include the requirements imposed by this subsection and subsections (3) and (4) of this section, as well as the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At the choice of the controller, the processor shall delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The processor shall make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations in this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The processor shall allow for, and contribute to, reasonable audits and inspections by the controller or the controller's designated auditor. Alternatively, the processor may, with the controller's consent, arrange for a qualified and independent auditor to conduct, at least annually and at the processor's expense, an audit of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and audit procedure for the audits as applicable, and provide a report of the audit to the controller upon request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In no event may any contract relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on them by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as defined by this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data are to be processed. A person that is not limited in its processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or that fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, it is a controller with respect to the processing.</p>

Data protection assessments are confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under chapter 42.56 RCW.
