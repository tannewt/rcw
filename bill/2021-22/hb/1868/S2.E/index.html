<p>The legislature recognizes that the COVID-19 public health emergency has pushed our health care system to its breaking point. Our nurses and health care workers who directly care for and support patients have continued to provide high-quality care despite the incredible challenges. But it has not been without significant cost. Nurses and health care workers are facing unprecedented levels of stress and job turnover. These concerns existed before the pandemic and have only worsened during this public health emergency. The legislature finds that improving nurse and health care worker safety and working conditions leads to better patient care. Specifically, establishing minimum nurse-to-patient staffing standards, expanding break and overtime laws for certain health care workers and to more health care facilities, and requiring hospitals to create staffing plans, all of which are subject to enforcement and penalties for violations, will better serve patients and our community.</p>

<p>The department may grant a variance from the minimum staffing standards in section 3 of this act for &quot;good cause.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Good cause&quot; means situations where a hospital can establish that compliance with the minimum staffing standards are infeasible, and that granting a variance does not have a significant harmful effect on the health, safety, and welfare of the involved employees and patients.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hospital, as defined in section 3 of this act, may seek a variance from the minimum staffing standards by submitting a written application to the department. The application must contain the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A justification for the variance, which establishes good cause for not complying with minimum staffing standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alternative minimum staffing standards that will be imposed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group of employees for whom the variance is sought;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence that infeasibility was discussed along with underlying data supporting the claim of infeasibility at least twice by the hospital staffing committee and a statement from the staffing committee where consensus exists or statements where there is dispute; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence that the hospital provided to the involved employees and, if applicable, to their union representatives, the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A copy of the written request for a variance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information about the right of the involved employees and, if applicable, their union representatives, to be heard by the department during the variance application review process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information about the process by which involved employees and, if applicable, their union representatives, may make a written request to the director for reconsideration, subject to the provisions established in subsection (7) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department's address and phone number, or other contact information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must allow the hospital, any involved employees and, if applicable, their union representatives, the opportunity for oral or written presentation during the variance application review process whenever circumstances of the particular application warrant it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than 60 days after the date on which the department received the application for a variance, the department must issue a written decision either granting or denying the variance. The department may extend the 60-day time period by providing advance written notice to the hospital and, if applicable, the union representatives of any involved employees, setting forth a reasonable justification for an extension of the 60-day time period, and specifying the duration of the extension. The hospital must provide involved employees with notice about any such extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variances shall be granted if the department determines that there is good cause for allowing a hospital to not comply with the minimum staffing standards in section 3 of this act. The variance order shall state the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The alternative minimum staffing standards approved in the variance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basis for a finding of good cause;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group of employees impacted; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The period of time for which the variance will be valid, not to exceed five years from the date of issuance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon making a determination for issuance of a variance, the department must provide notification in writing to the hospital and, if applicable, the union representatives of any involved employees. If the variance is denied, the written notification must include a stated basis for the denial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hospital, involved employee and, if applicable, their union representative, may file with the director a request for reconsideration within 15 days after receiving notice of the variance determination. The request for reconsideration must set forth the grounds upon which the reconsideration is being made. If reasonable grounds exist, the director may grant such review and, to the extent deemed appropriate, afford all interested parties an opportunity to be heard. If the director grants such review, the written decision of the department will remain in place until the reconsideration process is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless subject to the reconsideration process, the director may revoke or terminate the variance order at any time after giving the hospital at least 30 days' notice before revoking or terminating the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where immediate action is necessary pending further review by the department, the department may issue a temporary variance. The temporary variance will remain valid until the department determines whether good cause exists for issuing a variance. A hospital need not meet the requirement in subsection (2)(d) of this section in order to be granted a temporary variance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a hospital obtains a variance under this section, the hospital must provide the involved employees with information about the minimum staffing standards that apply within 15 days of receiving notification of such approval from the department. A hospital must make this information readily available to all employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variances under this section may be renewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may adopt rules to establish additional variance eligibility criteria.</p>
