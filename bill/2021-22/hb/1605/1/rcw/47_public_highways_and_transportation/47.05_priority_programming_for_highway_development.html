<p>The legislature finds that solutions to state highway deficiencies have become increasingly complex and diverse and that anticipated transportation revenues will fall substantially short of the amount required to satisfy all transportation needs. Difficult investment trade-offs will be required.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that investment of state transportation funds to address deficiencies on the state highway system be based on a policy of priority programming having as its basis the rational selection of projects and services according to factual need and an evaluation of life-cycle costs and benefits that are systematically scheduled to carry out defined objectives within available revenue. The state must develop analytic tools to use a common methodology to measure benefits and costs for all modes.</p>
<p>The priority programming system must ensure preservation of the existing state highway system, relieve congestion, provide mobility for people and goods, support the state's economy, and promote environmental protection and energy conservation.</p>
<p>The priority programming system must implement the state-owned highway component of the statewide transportation plan, consistent with local and regional transportation plans, by targeting state transportation investment to appropriate multimodal solutions that address identified state highway system deficiencies.</p>
<p>The priority programming system for improvements must incorporate a broad range of solutions that are identified in the statewide transportation plan as appropriate to address state highway system deficiencies, including but not limited to highway expansion, efficiency improvements, nonmotorized transportation facilities, high occupancy vehicle facilities, transit facilities and services, rail facilities and services, and transportation demand management programs.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall conduct periodic analyses of the entire state highway system and report to the office of financial management and the chairs of the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives, any subsequent recommendations to subdivide, classify, and subclassify all designated state highways into the following three functional classes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The &quot;principal arterial system&quot; shall consist of a connected network of rural arterial routes with appropriate extensions into and through urban areas, including all routes designated as part of the interstate system, which serve corridor movements having travel characteristics indicative of substantial statewide and interstate travel;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;minor arterial system&quot; shall, in conjunction with the principal arterial system, form a rural network of arterial routes linking cities and other activity centers which generate long distance travel, and, with appropriate extensions into and through urban areas, form an integrated network providing interstate and interregional service; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;collector system&quot; shall consist of routes which primarily serve the more important intercounty, intracounty, and intraurban travel corridors, collect traffic from the system of local access roads and convey it to the arterial system, and on which, regardless of traffic volume, the predominant travel distances are shorter than on arterial routes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt a functional classification of highways. The department shall consider comments from the public and local municipalities. The department shall give consideration to criteria consistent with this section and federal regulations relating to the functional classification of highways, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Urban population centers within and without the state stratified and ranked according to size;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Important traffic generating economic activities, including but not limited to recreation, agriculture, government, business, and industry;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feasibility of the route, including availability of alternate routes within and without the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directness of travel and distance between points of economic importance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Length of trips;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Character and volume of traffic;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preferential consideration for multiple service which shall include public transportation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasonable spacing depending upon population density; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System continuity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department or the legislature shall designate state highways of statewide significance under RCW 47.06.140. If the department designates a state highway of statewide significance, it shall submit a list of such facilities for adoption by the legislature. This statewide system shall include at a minimum interstate highways and other statewide principal arterials that are needed to connect major communities across the state and support the state's economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall designate a freight and goods transportation system. This statewide system shall include state highways, county roads, and city streets. The department, in cooperation with cities and counties, shall review and make recommendations to the legislature regarding policies governing weight restrictions and road closures which affect the transportation of freight and goods.</p>

<li>
<p>The office of financial management shall propose a comprehensive ten-year investment program for the preservation and improvement programs defined in this section, consistent with the policy goals described under RCW 47.04.280.

<p>The department shall use the transportation demand modeling tools developed under subsection (2) of this section to evaluate investments based on the best mode or improvement, or mix of modes and improvements, to meet current and future long-term demand within a corridor or system for the lowest cost. The end result of these demand modeling tools is to provide a cost-benefit analysis by which the department can determine the relative mobility improvement and congestion relief each mode or improvement under consideration will provide and the relative investment each mode or improvement under consideration will need to achieve that relief.</p>
