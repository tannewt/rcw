<p>All court-ordered restitution obligations that are ordered as a result of a conviction for a criminal offense in a court of limited jurisdiction may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action by the party or entity to whom the legal financial obligation is owed. The judgment and sentence must identify the party or entity to whom restitution is owed so that the state, party, or entity may enforce the judgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>At any time, the court may determine that the offender is not required to pay, or may relieve the offender of the requirement to pay, full or partial restitution and accrued interest on restitution to any insurer or entity that is not an individual if the court finds that the offender does not have the current or likely future ability to make full or partial restitution to the insurer or entity that is not an individual. For the purposes of this subsection, the terms &quot;entity,&quot; &quot;individual,&quot; and &quot;insurer&quot; have the same meanings as provided in RCW 9.94A.750(3).</strong></p>

<p>All court-ordered restitution obligations may be enforced at any time during the <strong>10-year</strong> period following the offender's release from total confinement or within <strong>10</strong> years of entry of the judgment and sentence, whichever period is longer. Prior to the expiration of the initial <strong>10-year</strong> period, the court may extend the criminal judgment an additional <strong>10</strong> years for payment of court-ordered restitution only if the court finds that the offender <strong>has the current or likely future ability to pay the restitution obligation. A person does not have the current ability to pay if the person is indigent as defined in RCW 10.01.160(3)</strong>.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section may be construed to deprive the court of the authority to determine whether the offender's failure to pay the legal financial obligation constitutes a violation of a condition of probation or to impose a sanction upon the offender if such a violation is found.</p>
