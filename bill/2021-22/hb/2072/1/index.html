<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/65_recording_registration_and_legal_publication/65.20_classification_of_manufactured_homes.html">65.20.010</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/65_recording_registration_and_legal_publication/65.20_classification_of_manufactured_homes.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislature recognizes that confusion exists regarding the classification of manufactured homes as personal or real property. This confusion is increased because manufactured homes are treated as vehicles in some parts of state statutes, however these homes are often used as residences to house persons residing in the state of Washington. This results in a variety of problems, including: (1) Creating confusion as to the creation, perfection, and priority of security interests in manufactured homes; (2) making it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing and title insurance; (3) making it more difficult to utilize manufactured homes as an affordable housing option; and (4) increasing the risk of problems for and losses to the consumer. Therefore the purpose of this chapter is to clarify the type of property manufactured homes are, particularly relating to security interests, and to <strong>improve the</strong> statutory process to make the manufactured home real property  when the home is affixed to land owned by the homeowner.</p>

The affidavit must state that the purchaser was notified that failure of the manufactured home to meet federal housing and urban development standards or failure of the manufactured home to meet a fire and safety inspection by the department of labor and industries may result in denial by a local jurisdiction of a permit to site the manufactured home.</p>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>When a manufactured/mobile or park model home is sold at a county treasurer's foreclosure or distraint sale, the registered owner of record, legal owner on title, and the purchaser are not required to sign the certificate of title and title application to transfer title. Any lienholder interest in a manufactured/mobile or park model home is extinguished by the county treasurer's foreclosure or distraint sale, provided that such lienholder has been provided a copy of the notice of the sale at his or her last known address, by registered letter, at least thirty days prior to the date of sale.</li>
