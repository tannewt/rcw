<p>The legislature finds that a statewide emergency communications network of  911 telephone service, which allows an immediate display of a caller's identification and location, would serve to further the safety, health, and welfare of the state's citizens, and would save lives.

<p>The state  911 coordinator, with the advice and assistance of the  911 advisory committee, must set nondiscriminatory, uniform technical and operational standards consistent with the rules of the federal communications commission for the transmission of 911 calls from radio communications service companies and interconnected voice over internet protocol service companies to  911 emergency communications systems. These standards must <strong>be modernized to align with national standards adopted by the state of Washington in rule making and</strong> not exceed the requirements set by the federal communications commission. The authority given to the state  911 coordinator in this section is limited to setting standards as set forth in this section and does not constitute authority to regulate radio communications service companies or interconnected voice over internet protocol service companies.</p>

<p>The department must administer and adopt rules as may be necessary to enforce and administer the state and county  911 excise taxes imposed or authorized by this chapter. Chapter 82.32 RCW, with the exception of RCW 82.32.045, 82.32.145, and 82.32.380, applies to the administration, collection, and enforcement of the state and county  911 excise taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state and county  911 excise taxes imposed or authorized by this chapter, along with reports and returns on forms prescribed by the department, are due at the same time the taxpayer reports other taxes under RCW 82.32.045. If no other taxes are reported under RCW 82.32.045, the taxpayer must remit tax on an annual basis in accordance with RCW 82.32.045.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may relieve any taxpayer or class of taxpayers from the obligation of remitting monthly and may require the return to cover other longer reporting periods, but in no event may returns be filed for a period greater than one year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state and county  911 excise taxes imposed or authorized by this chapter are in addition to any taxes imposed upon the same persons under chapters 82.08, 82.12, and 82.14 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Returns must be filed electronically using the department's online tax filing service or other method of electronic reporting as the department may authorize as provided in RCW 82.32.080.</strong></p>

<p>Counties imposing the  911 excise tax under RCW 82.14B.030 must contract with the department for the administration and collection of the tax. The department may deduct a percentage amount, as provided by contract, of no more than two percent of the  911 excise taxes collected to cover administration and collection expenses incurred by the department. If a county imposes <strong>a</strong> 911 excise tax with an effective date of January 1, 2011, the county must contract with the department for the administration and collection of the tax by October 15, 2010.</p>

<p>The remainder of any portion of the county  911 excise tax under RCW 82.14B.030 that is collected by the department must be deposited in the county  911 excise tax account hereby created in the custody of the state treasurer. Expenditures from the account may be used only for distribution to counties imposing the  911 excise tax. Only the director of the department or his or her designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is not subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, and an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>
