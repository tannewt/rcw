<p>Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this subsection, the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, allocated interests, and any limited common elements immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers must be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty days after distribution by unit owners of units to which twenty-five percent of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and its allocated interests by the total fair market values of all the units and their allocated interests.</p>

<p>In a condominium, plat community, or miscellaneous community, except as otherwise provided in subsection (10) of this section, foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire common interest community does not terminate the common interest community, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the common interest community, other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the common interest community. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate, or against common elements that have been subjected to a security interest by the association under RCW 64.90.465, does not withdraw that real estate from the common interest community, but the person taking title to the real estate may require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the common interest community.</p>

<li>
<p>The right of partition under chapter 7.52 RCW is suspended if an agreement to sell property is provided for in the termination agreement pursuant to subsection (3)(a), (b), or (c) of this section.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Deal with the declarant if the limit is more restrictive than the limit imposed on the power of the association to deal with other persons; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Institute litigation or an arbitration, mediation, or administrative proceeding against any person, subject to the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The association must comply with chapter 64.50 RCW, if applicable, before instituting any proceeding described in chapter 64.50 RCW in connection with construction defects; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board must promptly provide notice to the unit owners of any legal proceeding in which the association is a party other than proceedings involving enforcement of rules or to recover unpaid assessments or other sums due the association.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any borrowing by an association that is to be secured by an assignment of the association's right to receive future income pursuant to subsection (2)(e) and (p) of this section requires ratification by the unit owners as provided in this subsection.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The board must provide notice of the intent to borrow to all unit owners. The notice must include the purpose and maximum amount of the loan, the estimated amount and term of any assessments required to repay the loan, a reasonably detailed projection of how the money will be expended, and the interest rate and term of the loan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the notice, the board must set a date for a meeting of the unit owners, which must not be less than fourteen and no more than fifty days after mailing of the notice, to consider ratification of the borrowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless at that meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, unit owners holding a majority of the votes in the association or any larger percentage specified in the declaration reject the proposal to borrow funds, the association may proceed to borrow the funds in substantial accordance with the terms contained in the notice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a tenant of a unit owner violates the governing documents, in addition to exercising any of its powers against the unit owner, the association may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Exercise directly against the tenant the powers described in subsection (2)(l) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After giving notice to the tenant and the unit owner and an opportunity to be heard, levy reasonable fines against the tenant and unit owner for the violation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforce any other rights against the tenant for the violation that the unit owner as the landlord could lawfully have exercised under the lease or that the association could lawfully have exercised directly against the unit owner, or both; but the association does not have the right to terminate a lease or evict a tenant unless permitted by the declaration. The rights referred to in this subsection (5)(c) may be exercised only if the tenant or unit owner fails to cure the violation within ten days after the association notifies the tenant and unit owner of that violation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless a lease otherwise provides, this section does not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Affect rights that the unit owner has to enforce the lease or that the association has under other law; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permit the association to enforce a lease to which it is not a party in the absence of a violation of the governing documents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may determine whether to take enforcement action by exercising the association's power to impose sanctions or commencing an action for a violation of the governing documents, including whether to compromise any claim for unpaid assessments or other claim made by or against it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board does not have a duty to take enforcement action if it determines that, under the facts and circumstances presented:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The association's legal position does not justify taking any or further enforcement action;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The covenant, restriction, or rule being enforced is, or is likely to be construed as, inconsistent with law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although a violation may exist or may have occurred, it is not so material as to be objectionable to a reasonable person or to justify expending the association's resources; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not in the association's best interests to pursue an enforcement action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board's decision under subsections (7) and (8) of this section to not pursue enforcement under one set of circumstances does not prevent the board from taking enforcement action under another set of circumstances, but the board may not be arbitrary or capricious in taking enforcement action.</p>

<p>The board may by rule designate physical components of the property for which a unit owner is otherwise responsible that present a heightened risk of damage or harm to persons or property if the physical components fail. The association may require that specific measures be taken by the unit owner or the association to diminish that risk of harm. If a unit owner fails to accomplish any necessary maintenance, repair, or replacement to those components, or fails to take any other measures required of the unit owner under this subsection, the association may, after notice to a unit owner and an opportunity to be heard, enter the unit in the manner pursuant to subsection (3) of this section to perform such maintenance, repair, replacement, or measure at the expense of that unit owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon prior notice, except in case of an emergency, each unit owner must afford to the association and the other unit owners, and to their agents or employees, access through that owner's unit and limited common elements reasonably necessary for the purposes stated in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, including necessary inspections by the association. If damage is inflicted on the common elements or on any unit through which access is taken, the unit owner responsible for the damage, or the association if it is responsible, is liable for the prompt repair of the damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the liability that a declarant as a unit owner has under this chapter, the declarant alone is liable for all expenses in connection with real estate subject to development rights and no other unit owner and no other portion of the common interest community is subject to a claim for payment of those expenses. However, the declaration may provide that the expenses associated with the operation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of a common element that the owners have a right to use must be paid by the association as a common expense. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any income or proceeds from real estate subject to development rights inures to the declarant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a plat community or miscellaneous community, if all development rights have expired with respect to any real estate, the declarant remains liable for all expenses of that real estate unless, upon expiration, the declaration provides that the real estate becomes common elements or units.</p>

<p>The following requirements apply to unit owner meetings:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A meeting of the association must be held at least once each year. Failure to hold an annual meeting does not cause a forfeiture or give cause for dissolution of the association and does not affect otherwise valid association acts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An association must hold a special meeting of unit owners to address any matter affecting the common interest community or the association if its president, a majority of the board, or unit owners having at least twenty percent, or any lower percentage specified in the organizational documents, of the votes in the association request that the secretary call the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the association does not provide notice to unit owners of a special meeting within thirty days after the requisite number or percentage of unit owners request the secretary to do so, the requesting members may directly provide notice to all the unit owners of the meeting. Only matters described in the meeting notice required in (c) of this subsection may be considered at a special meeting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An association must provide notice to unit owners of the time, date, and place of each annual and special unit owners meeting not less than fourteen days and not more than fifty days before the meeting date. Notice may be by any means described in RCW 64.90.515. The notice of any meeting must state the time, date, and place of the meeting and the items on the agenda, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The text of any proposed amendment to the declaration or organizational documents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any changes in the previously approved budget that result in a change in the assessment obligations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any proposal to remove a board member or officer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum time to provide notice required in (c) of this subsection may be reduced or waived for a meeting called to deal with an emergency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit owners must be given a reasonable opportunity at any meeting to comment regarding any matter affecting the common interest community or the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise restricted by the declaration or organizational documents, meetings of unit owners may be conducted by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process, if the process is consistent with subsection (2)(i) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following requirements apply to meetings of the board and committees authorized to act for the board:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Meetings must be open to the unit owners except during executive sessions, but the board may expel or prohibit attendance by any person who, after warning by the chair of the meeting, disrupts the meeting. The board and those committees may hold an executive session only during a regular or special meeting of the board or a committee. A final vote or action may not be taken during an executive session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An executive session may be held only to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Consult with the association's attorney concerning legal matters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss existing or potential litigation or mediation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss labor or personnel matters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss contracts, leases, and other commercial transactions to purchase or provide goods or services currently being negotiated, including the review of bids or proposals, if premature general knowledge of those matters would place the association at a disadvantage; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent public knowledge of the matter to be discussed if the board or committee determines that public knowledge would violate the privacy of any person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, a gathering of members of the board or committees at which the board or committee members do not conduct association business is not a meeting of the board or committee. Board members and committee members may not use incidental or social gatherings to evade the open meeting requirements of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the period of declarant control, the board must meet at least four times a year. At least one of those meetings must be held at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the community. After the transition meeting, all board meetings must be at the common interest community or at a place convenient to the common interest community unless the unit owners amend the bylaws to vary the location of those meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At each board meeting, the board must provide a reasonable opportunity for unit owners to comment regarding matters affecting the common interest community and the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the meeting is included in a schedule given to the unit owners or the meeting is called to deal with an emergency, the secretary or other officer specified in the organizational documents must provide notice of each board meeting to each board member and to the unit owners. The notice must be given at least fourteen days before the meeting and must state the time, date, place, and agenda of the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any materials are distributed to the board before the meeting, the board must make copies of those materials reasonably available to the unit owners, except that the board need not make available copies of unapproved minutes or materials that are to be considered in executive session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, fewer than all board members may participate in a regular or special meeting by or conduct a meeting through the use of any means of communication by which all board members participating can hear each other during the meeting. A board member participating in a meeting by these means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the organizational documents provide otherwise, the board may meet by participation of all board members by telephonic, video, or other conferencing process if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The meeting notice states the conferencing process to be used and provides information explaining how unit owners may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a central location or conference connection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process provides all unit owners the opportunity to hear or perceive the discussion and to comment as provided in (e) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the transition meeting, unit owners may amend the organizational documents to vary the procedures for meetings described in (i) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent as documented in a record by all its members. Actions taken by unanimous consent must be kept as a record of the association with the meeting minutes. After the transition meeting, the board may act by unanimous consent only to undertake ministerial actions, actions subject to ratification by the unit owners, or to implement actions previously taken at a meeting of the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A board member who is present at a board meeting at which any action is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the board member's dissent or abstention to such action is lodged with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before adjournment of the meeting or provided in a record to the secretary of the association immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right to dissent or abstain does not apply to a board member who voted in favor of such action at the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A board member may not vote by proxy or absentee ballot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if an action by the board is not in compliance with this section, it is valid unless set aside by a court. A challenge to the validity of an action of the board for failure to comply with this section may not be brought more than ninety days after the minutes of the board of the meeting at which the action was taken are approved or the record of that action is distributed to unit owners, whichever is later.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minutes of all unit owner meetings and board meetings, excluding executive sessions, must be maintained in a record. The decision on each matter voted upon at a board meeting or unit owner meeting must be recorded in the minutes.</p>

<li>
<p>If only one of several unit owners of a unit is present, that unit owner is entitled to cast all the votes allocated to that unit. If more than one of the unit owners are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority in interest of the unit owners, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise. There is a majority agreement if any one of the unit owners casts the votes allocated to the unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other unit owners of the unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless a greater number or fraction of the votes in the association is required under this chapter or the declaration or organizational documents, a majority of the votes cast determines the outcome of any action of the association.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The name of each candidate and the text of each proposal to be voted upon are set forth in a writing accompanying or contained in the notice of meeting; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ballot is provided by the association for such purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a unit owner votes by absentee ballot, the association must be able to verify that the ballot is cast by the unit owner having the right to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided otherwise in the declaration or organizational documents, the following requirements apply with respect to proxy voting:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a directed or undirected proxy duly executed by a unit owner in the same manner as provided in RCW 24.06.110.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a unit is owned by more than one person, each unit owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other unit owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit owner may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section only by actual notice of revocation to the secretary or the person presiding over a meeting of the association or by delivery of a subsequent proxy. The death or disability of a unit owner does not revoke a proxy given by the unit owner unless the person presiding over the meeting has actual notice of the death or disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice.</p>

<li>
<p>The association must deliver a ballot to every unit owner with the notice.</p>

<li>
<p>The ballot must set forth each proposed action and provide an opportunity to vote for or against the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ballot cast pursuant to this section may be revoked only by actual notice to the association of revocation. The death or disability of a unit owner does not revoke a ballot unless the association has actual notice of the death or disability prior to the date set forth in (b)(i) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval by ballot pursuant to this subsection is valid only if the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action.</p>

<p>Property insurance on the common elements and, in a plat community or miscellaneous community, also on property that must become common elements, insuring against risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against, which insurance, after application of any deductibles, must be not less than eighty percent of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from property policies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commercial general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined by the board, but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements and, in cooperatives, of all units;</p>

<li>
<p>Fidelity insurance; and</p>

<p>Other insurance required under the declaration.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a building that contains units divided by horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, or vertical boundaries that comprise common walls between units, the insurance maintained under subsection (1)(a) of this section, to the extent reasonably available, must include the units and, unless provided otherwise in the declaration, all improvements and betterments to the units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the insurance described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section is not reasonably available, the association must promptly cause notice of that fact to be given to all unit owners. The association may carry any other insurance it considers appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section must provide that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of the unit owner's interest in the common elements or membership in the association;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or member of the unit owner's household;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any act or omission by a unit owner, unless acting within the unit owner's scope of authority on behalf of the association, does not void the policy and is not a condition to recovery under the policy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any loss covered by the property insurance policy under subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section must be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any holder of a security interest. The insurance trustee or the association must hold any insurance proceeds in trust for the association, unit owners, and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to subsection (8) of this section, the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or replacement of the damaged property, and the association, unit owners, and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or replaced, or the common interest community is terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for the unit owner's own benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section must issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon a request made in a record, to any unit owner or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy may not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy unless the insurer has complied with all applicable provisions of chapter 48.18 RCW pertaining to the cancellation or nonrenewal of contracts of insurance. The insurer may not modify the amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy without complying with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any portion of the common interest community for which insurance is required under this section that is damaged or destroyed must be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The common interest community is terminated, in which case RCW 64.90.290 applies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repair or replacement would be illegal; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eighty percent of the unit owners, including every unit owner of a unit or assigned limited common element that will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost of repair or replacement not paid from insurance proceeds is a common expense. If all of the damaged or destroyed portions of the common interest community are not repaired or replaced:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the common interest community; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except to the extent that other persons will be distributees:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements that are not repaired or replaced must be distributed to the unit owners of those units and the unit owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lienholders, as their interests may appear; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders, as their interests may appear, as follows:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>In a condominium, in proportion to the common element interests of all the units; and</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under RCW 64.90.030, and the association promptly must prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this section may be varied or waived as provided in the declaration if all units of a common interest community are restricted to nonresidential use.</p>

<p>Assessments for common expenses and specially allocated expenses must commence on all units that have been created upon the conveyance of the first unit in the common interest community; however, the declarant may delay commencement of assessments for some or all common expenses or specially allocated expenses, in which event the declarant must pay all of the common expenses or specially allocated expenses that have been delayed.

<p>Expenses associated with the operation, maintenance, repair, or replacement of any specified limited common element against the units to which that limited common element is assigned, equally or in any other proportion that the declaration provides;</p>

<p>Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.</p>

<p>To the extent that any expense of the association is caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence of any unit owner or that unit owner's tenant, guest, invitee, or occupant, the association may assess that expense against the unit owner's unit after notice and an opportunity to be heard, even if the association maintains insurance with respect to that damage or common expense.</p>

<li>
<p>If the declaration so provides, to the extent that any expense of the association is caused by the negligence of any unit owner or that unit owner's tenant, guest, invitee, or occupant, the association may assess that expense against the unit owner's unit after notice and an opportunity to be heard, to the extent of the association's deductible and any expenses not covered under an insurance policy issued to the association.</p>

<li>

The association or its authorized representative may purchase the unit at the foreclosure sale and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the unit. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the period of redemption is eight months.</p>

<p>In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests in the units are real estate, the association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or by power of sale under (b) of this subsection.</p>

<li>
<p>If the unit owner's interest in a unit in a cooperative is real estate, the following requirements apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The association, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this subsection, may sell that unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time and place. The association must give to the unit owner and any lessee of the unit owner reasonable notice in a record of the time, date, and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time and date after which a private conveyance may be made. Such notice must also be sent to any other person that has a recorded interest in the unit that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required under this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. A sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed to or as stated in this section, the unit owner is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The reasonable expenses of sale;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; the reasonable expenses of holding, maintaining, and preparing the unit for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges and premiums on insurance; and, to the extent provided for by agreement between the association and the unit owner, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and other legal expenses incurred by the association;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfaction of the association's lien;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remittance of any excess to the unit owner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good-faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with this section. The person conducting the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed by the person after a foreclosure of the association's lien by power of sale and that the person was empowered to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required under this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the conveyance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At any time before the association has conveyed a unit in a cooperative or entered into a contract for its conveyance under the power of sale, the unit owners or the holder of any subordinate security interest may cure the unit owner's default and prevent sale or other conveyance by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including any amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the creditor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an action by an association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section, the court may appoint a receiver to collect all sums alleged to be due and owing to a unit owner before commencement or during pendency of the action. The receivership is governed under chapter 7.60 RCW. During pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the association for any assessments against the unit. The exercise of rights under this subsection by the association does not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure is not liable for assessments or installments of assessments that became due prior to such right of possession. Such unpaid assessments are deemed to be common expenses collectible from all the unit owners, including such mortgagee or other purchaser of the unit. Foreclosure of a mortgage does not relieve the prior unit owner of personal liability for assessments accruing against the unit prior to the date of such sale as provided in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to constituting a lien on the unit, each assessment is the joint and several obligation of the unit owner of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due. A unit owner may not exempt himself or herself from liability for assessments. In a voluntary conveyance other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a unit is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor's conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment is maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020, on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments of assessments. If the association does not establish such a rate, delinquent assessments bear interest from the date of delinquency at the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020 on the date on which the assessments became delinquent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association is entitled to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in a suit being commenced or prosecuted to judgment. The prevailing party is also entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in such suits, including any appeals, if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent not inconsistent with this section, the declaration may provide for such additional remedies for collection of assessments as may be permitted by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An association may not commence an action to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The unit owner, at the time the action is commenced, owes at least a sum equal to the greater of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Three months or more of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account; or</p>

<li>
<p>$200 of assessments, not including fines, late charges, interest, attorneys' fees, or costs incurred by the association in connection with the collection of a delinquent owner's account;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>At or after the date that assessments have become past due for at least 90 days, the association has mailed, by first-class mail, to the owner, at the unit address and to any other address which the owner has provided to the association, a notice of delinquency, which shall state as follows:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this subsection, a judgment for money against the association perfected under RCW 4.64.020 is not a lien on the common elements, but is a lien in favor of the judgment lienholder against all of the other real estate of the association and all of the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered. Other property of a unit owner is not subject to the claims of creditors of the association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the association has granted a security interest in the common elements to a creditor of the association pursuant to RCW 64.90.465, the holder of that security interest must exercise its right against the common elements before its judgment lien on any unit may be enforced.</p>

<li>
<p>Whether perfected before or after the creation of the common interest community, if a lien, other than a deed of trust or mortgage, including a judgment lien or lien attributable to work performed or materials supplied before creation of the common interest community, becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to the unit, and the lienholder, upon receipt of payment, must promptly deliver a release of the lien covering that unit. The amount of the payment must be proportionate to the ratio that the unit owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners that are subject to the lien. After payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against that unit owner's unit for any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien.</p>

<li>
<p>A judgment against the association must be recorded and indexed in the name of the common interest community and the association and, when so indexed, is notice of the lien against the units.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>&quot;RIGHT TO CANCEL. (1) You are entitled to receive a copy of this public offering statement and all material amendments to this public offering statement before conveyance of your unit. Under RCW 64.90.635, you have the right to cancel your contract for the purchase of your unit within seven days after first receiving this public offering statement. If this public offering statement is first provided to you more than seven days before you sign your contract for the purchase of your unit, you have no right to cancel your contract. If this public offering statement is first provided to you seven days or less before you sign your contract for the purchase of your unit, you have the right to cancel, before conveyance of the unit, the executed contract by delivering, no later than the seventh day after first receiving this public offering statement, a notice of cancellation pursuant to section (3) of this notice. If this public offering statement is first provided to you less than seven days before the closing date for the conveyance of your unit, you may, before conveyance of your unit to you, extend the closing date to a date not more than seven days after you first received this public offering statement, so that you may have seven days to cancel your contract for the purchase of your unit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have no right to cancel your contract upon receipt of an amendment to this public offering statement; however, this does not eliminate any right to rescind your contract, due to the disclosure of the information in the amendment, that is otherwise available to you under generally applicable contract law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you elect to cancel your contract pursuant to this notice, you may do so by hand-delivering notice of cancellation, or by mailing notice of cancellation by prepaid United States mail, to the seller at the address set forth in this public offering statement or at the address of the seller's registered agent for service of process. The date of such notice is the date of receipt, if hand-delivered, or the date of deposit in the United States mail, if mailed. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made to the seller by you before cancellation must be refunded promptly.&quot;</p>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>
<p>&quot;OTHER DOCUMENTS CREATING BINDING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. This public offering statement is a summary of some of the significant aspects of purchasing a unit in this common interest community. The governing documents and the purchase agreement are complex, contain other important information, and create binding legal obligations. You should consider seeking the assistance of legal counsel.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;OTHER REPRESENTATIONS. You may not rely on any statement, promise, model, depiction, or description unless it is (1) contained in the public offering statement delivered to you or (2) made in writing signed by the declarant or dealer or the declarant's or dealer's agent identified in the public offering statement. A statement of opinion, or a commendation of the real estate, its quality, or its value, does not create a warranty, and a statement, promise, model, depiction, or description does not create a warranty if it discloses that it is only proposed, is not representative, or is subject to change.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;MODEL UNITS. Model units are intended to provide you with a general idea of what a finished unit might look like. Units being offered for sale may vary from the model unit in terms of floor plan, fixtures, finishes, and equipment. You are advised to obtain specific information about the unit you are considering purchasing.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;RESERVE STUDY. The association [does] [does not] have a current reserve study. Any reserve study should be reviewed carefully. It may not include all reserve components that will require major maintenance, repair, or replacement in future years, and may not include regular contributions to a reserve account for the cost of such maintenance, repair, or replacement. You may encounter certain risks, including being required to pay as a special assessment your share of expenses for the cost of major maintenance, repair, or replacement of a reserve component, as a result of the failure to: (1) Have a current reserve study or fully funded reserves, (2) include a component in a reserve study, or (3) provide any or sufficient contributions to a reserve account for a component.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;DEPOSITS AND PAYMENTS. Only earnest money and reservation deposits are required to be placed in an escrow or trust account. Any other payments you make to the seller of a unit are at risk and may be lost if the seller defaults.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;CONSTRUCTION DEFECT CLAIMS. Chapter 64.50 RCW contains important requirements you must follow before you may file a lawsuit for defective construction against the seller or builder of your home. Forty-five days before you file your lawsuit, you must deliver to the seller or builder a written notice of any construction conditions you allege are defective and provide your seller or builder the opportunity to make an offer to repair or pay for the defects. You are not obligated to accept any offer made by the builder or seller. There are strict deadlines and procedures under state law, and failure to follow them may affect your ability to file a lawsuit.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;ASSOCIATION INSURANCE. The extent to which association insurance provides coverage for the benefit of unit owners (including furnishings, fixtures, and equipment in a unit) is determined by the provisions of the declaration and the association's insurance policy, which may be modified from time to time. You and your personal insurance agent should read the declaration and the association's policy prior to closing to determine what insurance is required of the association and unit owners, unit owners' rights and duties, what is and is not covered by the association's policy, and what additional insurance you should obtain.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;QUALIFIED WARRANTY. Your unit [is] [is not] covered by a qualified warranty under chapter 64.35 RCW. &quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public offering statement must include copies of each of the following documents: The declaration; the map; the organizational documents; the rules, if any; the current or proposed budget for the association; a dated balance sheet of the association; any inspection and repair report or reports prepared in accordance with the requirements of RCW 64.55.090; and any qualified warranty provided to a purchaser by a declarant together with a history of claims under the qualified warranty. If any of these documents are not in final form, the documents must be marked &quot;draft&quot; and, before closing the sale of a unit, the purchaser must be given notice of any material changes to the draft documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A declarant must promptly amend the public offering statement to reflect any material change in the information required under this section.</p>

<p>With respect to a purchaser of a condominium unit that may be used for residential use, no disclaimer of implied warranties of quality under RCW 64.90.670 is effective, except that a declarant and any dealer may disclaim liability in an instrument for one or more specified defects or failures to comply with applicable law, if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The declarant or dealer knows or has reason to believe that the specific defects or failures exist at the time of disclosure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disclaimer specifically describes the defects or failures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disclaimer includes a statement as to the effect of the defects or failures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disclaimer is bold faced, capitalized, underlined, or otherwise set out from surrounding material so as to be conspicuous; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disclaimer is signed by the purchaser.</p>

<li>
<p>A declarant or dealer may not make an express written warranty of quality that limits the implied warranties of quality made to the purchaser set forth in RCW 64.90.670.</p>

<li>
<p>A proceeding for breach of any obligations arising under RCW 64.90.665, 64.90.670, or 64.90.675 must be commenced within four years after the cause of action accrues. The period for commencing an action for a breach accruing pursuant to subsection (2)(a) of this section does not expire prior to one year after termination of the period of declarant control, if any, under RCW 64.90.415. Such periods may not be reduced by either oral or written agreement or through the use of contractual claims or notice procedures that require the filing or service of any claim or notice prior to the expiration of the period specified in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to subsection (3) of this section, a cause of action for breach of warranty of quality, regardless of the purchaser's lack of knowledge of the breach, accrues:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>As to a unit, the latest of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The date the unit was conveyed to the purchaser to whom the warranty is first made; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date any portion of the unit that constitutes a building enclosure as defined in RCW 64.55.010(3) was completed; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As to each common element, at the latest of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The date the common element was completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date the common element was added to the condominium; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date the first unit in the condominium was conveyed to a bona fide purchaser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a warranty of quality explicitly extends to future performance or duration of any improvement or component of the condominium, the cause of action accrues at the time the breach is discovered or at the end of the period for which the warranty explicitly extends, whichever is earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a written notice of claim is served under RCW 64.50.020 within the time prescribed for the filing of an action under this chapter, the statutes of limitation in this chapter and any applicable statutes of repose for construction-related claims are tolled until sixty days after the period of time during which the filing of an action is barred under RCW 64.50.020.</p>
