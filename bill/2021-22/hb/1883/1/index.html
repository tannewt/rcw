<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that youth and young adults continue to disproportionately exit public systems of care into chronic instability, such as homelessness and involvement in the criminal legal system. Further, support systems in Washington are unnecessarily fragmented and often difficult for youth and young adults to navigate during times of need. The legislature finds that cascading impacts of insufficient support and mentorship create systemic barriers and increased rates of chronic stress and trauma including, but not limited to, reduced high school graduation rates, chronic homelessness, increased child welfare and juvenile justice and criminal legal system involvement, limited postsecondary education attainment, and greater barriers to employment in adulthood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that preventative services are more cost-effective than emergency services, and that preventative services yield better long-term results for beneficiaries and Washington's economy. The legislature recognizes that people with personal experience in public systems of care have a unique perspective and outlook on life to improve work environments, culture, and equitability. The legislature further finds that an effective and accessible lifeline to services is necessary to the health of Washington's economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that a report commissioned by the department of commerce in 2020 found that young persons are more likely to experience chronic stress and trauma when they are not discharged into safe and stable environments. The legislature further finds that one in four of youth and young adults exiting public systems of care experienced housing instability within 12 months. The legislature finds that system modification is needed to improve outcomes for youth and young adults through better transition planning and support before and after exit from public systems of care. The legislature finds that access to resource assistance for youth and young adults with experience in public systems of care needs to be streamlined. In communities where resources are inadequate to meet the demand, the state must directly fill existing gaps and promote community partnerships as the basis of a shared coalition to create additional resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish streamlined support and access to services for youth and young adults who have experienced or are at risk of entering public systems of care. The legislature intends to establish the lifeline for independent living to facilitate and promote partnerships across state agencies, tribes, counties, and community-based providers to coordinate trauma-informed, healing-centered, and culturally responsive services for youth and young adults and their natural supports to facilitate stability.</p>

The lifeline shall facilitate and promote partnerships across state agencies, tribes, counties, and community-based providers to coordinate trauma-informed and culturally responsive services for youth and young adults and their supports.</p>
