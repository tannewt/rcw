<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to reduce environmental and health disparities in Washington state and improve the health of all Washington state residents. This chapter implements the recommendations of the environmental justice task force established in section 221(48), chapter 415, Laws of 2019 entitled &quot;Report to the Washington state governor and legislature, Environmental Justice Task Force: Recommendations for Prioritizing EJ in Washington State Government (October 2020).&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As conveyed in the task force report, Washington state studies and national studies found that people of color and low-income people continue to be disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards in their communities. As a result, there is a higher risk of adverse health outcomes for those communities. This risk is amplified when overlaid on communities with preexisting social and economic barriers and environmental risks, and creates cumulative environmental health impacts, which this act seeks to prevent and mitigate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, the state has a compelling interest in ensuring that such environmental health disparities are prevented and addressed in the administration of ongoing and new environmental programs, including allocation of funds, and that these programs should be administered so as to remedy the effects of past disparate treatment of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force provided recommendations to state agencies for measurable goals and model policies to reduce environmental health inequities in Washington, equitable practices for meaningful community involvement, and how to use the environmental health disparities map to identify and promote the equitable distribution of environmental benefits to overburdened communities. In order for all communities in Washington state to be healthy and thriving, state government must concentrate on communities that currently have the greatest environmental and health burdens.</p>

<li>
<p>When considering a significant agency action, an agency must conduct an environmental justice assessment as described in this section to inform and support the agency considering overburdened and vulnerable populations when making decisions and to assist the agency with the equitable distribution of environmental benefits, reduction of environmental harms, and the identification and reduction of environmental and health disparities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2023, and subject to the considerations of subsections (3) through (7) of this section and the identification and prioritization of significant agency actions by the council and the interagency work group, each agency following the guidance from and in iterative consultation with the council must develop a process for conducting environmental justice assessments, determining what additional actions prompt an assessment, and determining any other relevant factors for assessment based on the unique mission, authorities, and priorities of each agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a minimum, environmental justice assessments must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Consider guidelines prepared by the council relating to best practices on environmental justice assessments and when and how to use cumulative environmental health impact analysis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilize cumulative environmental health impact analysis, such as the environmental health disparities map or other data that considers the effects of a proposed action on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify overburdened communities and vulnerable populations who may be affected by the proposed action and the potential environmental and health impacts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify any local and regional impacts to tribal treaty reserved rights and resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Summarize community input and describe how overburdened communities, vulnerable populations, affected tribes, and indigenous populations may be further involved in development of the proposed action; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe options and readily available cost projections for the agency to reduce, mitigate, or eliminate any impacts on overburdened communities, or provide a reasonable justification for not doing so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To obtain information for the purposes of assessments, an agency should consult with members of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations to assist in the accurate assessment of the potential impact of the action and in developing the means to reduce or eliminate the impact on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the environmental justice assessment, the agency must seek to reduce or eliminate the negative impacts and maximize the benefits created by the action on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations. Consistent with agency authority, mission, and mandates, the agency must consider each of the following methods for reducing such an impact or equitably distributing benefit:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Eliminating disparities and the unequal effect of environmental harms on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing or ensuring the action does not add to the cumulative environmental health impacts on overburdened communities or vulnerable populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring the action contributes to reducing the cumulative environmental health impacts on overburdened communities or vulnerable populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing equitable participation and meaningful engagement of vulnerable populations and overburdened communities in the development of the agency action;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritizing equitable distribution of resources and benefits to overburdened communities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring positive workforce and job outcomes for overburdened communities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting a community need identified by the affected overburdened community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifying substantive regulatory or policy requirements; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other mitigation techniques, including those suggested by the council, the office of equity, or representatives of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the agency determines it cannot avoid or reduce the harmful impact of the action on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations or address the distribution of environmental and health benefits, the agency must provide a clear explanation of why it has made that determination, make that explanation part of the record of the decision, and provide notice of that explanation to members of the public who participated in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing a process for conducting environmental justice assessments, the agency must consider any guidelines developed by the council pursuant to section 20 of this act.</p>
