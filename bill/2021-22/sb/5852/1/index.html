<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that it is the public policy of the state that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Environmental marketing claims for plastic products, whether implicit or implied, should adhere to uniform and recognized test methods for biodegradability. Plastic products marketed as being biodegradable should be readily and easily identifiable by supported third-party scientific test methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legitimate and responsible packaging and plastic product manufacturers are using biodegradable additives in order to enhance biodegradability in plastic products when introduced to landfill, marine, or microbe-rich soil environments. The labeling of products as biodegradable and their use should not be discouraged when they biodegrade in a manner recognized by national and international testing standards organizations in these environmental conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biodegradable plastic additives are recognized by the federal trade commission and the European Union. The test methods used to verify biodegradability, as developed by the American society for testing and materials and the international organization for standardization, are internationally recognized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to authorize plastic products that are verified by certain third-party testing methods to be labeled as biodegradable in the state of Washington.</p>
