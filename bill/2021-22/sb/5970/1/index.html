<p>Voters have repeatedly approved initiatives limiting vehicle costs, yet politicians keep ignoring the voters' repeated, unambiguous mandate by imposing higher and higher vehicle taxes and fees. It's not fair and it must stop. Without this follow-up ballot measure, vehicle costs will continue to skyrocket until vehicle charges are obscenely expensive, as they were prior to Initiative 695. This act and each of its provisions limit state and local taxes, fees, and other charges relating to motor vehicles. This act would limit annual motor vehicle license fees to $30, except voter-approved charges; repeal and remove authority to impose certain vehicle taxes and charges; and base vehicle taxes on Kelley Blue Book.</p>

<li>
<p>State and local motor vehicle license fees may not exceed $30 per year for motor vehicles, regardless of year, value, make, or model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;state and local motor vehicle license fees&quot; means the general license tab fees paid annually for licensing motor vehicles, including but not limited to cars, sport utility vehicles, light trucks under RCW 46.17.355, motorcycles, and motor homes, and do not include charges approved by voters after the effective date of this section. This annual fee must be paid and collected annually and is due at the time of initial and renewal vehicle registration.</p>

<li>
<p>Any motor vehicle excise tax must be calculated in an honest and accurate way so the burden on vehicle owners is not artificially inflated. For the purpose of determining a vehicle tax, a taxing district imposing a vehicle tax must set a vehicle's taxable value at the vehicle's base model Kelley Blue Book value. This ensures an honest and accurate calculation of the tax and, combined with the appeal process in RCW 82.44.065, ensures that vehicle owners are taxed on their vehicle's market value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of determining a tax under this chapter, the value of a truck-type power or trailing unit, or motor vehicle, including a passenger vehicle, motorcycle, motor home, sport utility vehicle, or light duty truck is the base model Kelley Blue Book value of the vehicle, excluding applicable federal excise taxes, state and local sales or use taxes, transportation or shipping costs, or preparatory or delivery costs.</p>
