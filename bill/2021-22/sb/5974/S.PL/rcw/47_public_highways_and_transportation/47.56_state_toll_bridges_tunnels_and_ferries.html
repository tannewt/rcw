<li>
<p>Except as permitted under chapter 47.29 or 47.46 RCW:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department of transportation shall have full charge of the planning, analysis, and construction of all toll bridges and other toll facilities including the Washington state ferries, and the operation and maintenance thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transportation commission shall determine and establish the tolls and charges thereon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise delegated, and subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department shall have full charge of planning, analysis, and design of all toll facilities. The department may conduct the planning, analysis, and design of toll facilities as necessary to support the legislature's consideration of toll authorization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall utilize and administer toll collection systems that are simple, unified, and interoperable. To the extent practicable, the department shall avoid the use of toll booths. The department shall set the statewide standards and protocols for all toll facilities within the state, including those authorized by local authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in this section, the department shall proceed with the construction of such toll bridges and other facilities and the approaches thereto by contract in the manner of state highway construction immediately upon there being made available funds for such work and shall prosecute such work to completion as rapidly as practicable. The department is authorized to negotiate contracts for any amount without bid under (e)(i) and (ii) of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Emergency contracts, in order to make repairs to ferries or ferry terminal facilities or removal of such facilities whenever continued use of ferries or ferry terminal facilities constitutes a real or immediate danger to the traveling public or precludes prudent use of such ferries or facilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single source contracts for vessel dry dockings, when there is clearly and legitimately only one available bidder to conduct dry dock-related work for a specific class or classes of vessels. The contracts may be entered into for a single vessel dry docking or for multiple vessel dry dockings for a period not to exceed two years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any new vessel planning, construction, purchase, analysis, or design work must be consistent with RCW 47.60.810.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall proceed with the procurement of materials, supplies, services, and equipment needed for the support, maintenance, and use of a ferry, ferry terminal, or other facility operated by Washington state ferries, in accordance with chapter 43.19 RCW except as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When the secretary of the department of transportation determines in writing that the use of invitation for bid is either not practicable or not advantageous to the state and it may be necessary to make competitive evaluations, including technical or performance evaluations among acceptable proposals to complete the contract award, a contract may be entered into by use of a competitive sealed proposals method, and a formal request for proposals solicitation. Such formal request for proposals solicitation shall include a functional description of the needs and requirements of the state and the significant factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When purchases are made through a formal request for proposals solicitation the contract shall be awarded to the responsible proposer whose competitive sealed proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the state taking into consideration price and other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No significant factors may be used in evaluating a proposal that are not specified in the request for proposals. Factors that may be considered in evaluating proposals include but are not limited to: Price; maintainability; reliability; commonality; performance levels; life-cycle cost if applicable under this section; cost of transportation or delivery; delivery schedule offered; installation cost; cost of spare parts; availability of parts and service offered; and the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The ability, capacity, and skill of the proposer to perform the contract or provide the service required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the proposer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the proposer can perform the contract within the time specified;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous and existing compliance by the proposer with laws relating to the contract or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objective, measurable criteria defined in the request for proposal. These criteria may include but are not limited to items such as discounts, delivery costs, maintenance services costs, installation costs, and transportation costs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When purchases are made through a request for proposal process, proposals received shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. When issuing a request for proposal for the procurement of propulsion equipment or systems that include an engine, the request for proposal must specify the use of a life-cycle cost analysis that includes an evaluation of fuel efficiency. When a life-cycle cost analysis is used, the life-cycle cost of a proposal shall be given at least the same relative importance as the initial price element specified in the request of proposal documents. The department may reject any and all proposals received. If the proposals are not rejected, the award shall be made to the proposer whose proposal is most advantageous to the department, considering price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.</p>

<p>Before the department proceeds with any action to secure a right-of-way or with construction of any toll bridge under the provisions of this chapter, the commission shall first pass a resolution that public interest and necessity require the acquisition of right-of-way for and the construction of the toll bridge. The resolution is conclusive evidence (1) of the public necessity of such construction; (2) that the property is necessary therefor; and (3) that the proposed construction is planned or located in a manner which will be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.

In eminent domain proceedings to acquire property for any of the purposes of this chapter, any toll bridge, real property, personal property, franchises, rights, easements, or other property or privileges appurtenant thereto appropriated or dedicated to a public use or purpose by any person, firm, private, public, or municipal corporation, county, city, town, district, or any political subdivision of the state, may be condemned and taken, and the acquisition and use as provided in this chapter for the same public use or purpose to which the property has been so appropriated or dedicated, or for any other public use or purpose, is a superior and permanent right and necessity, and a more necessary use and purpose than the public use or purpose to which the property has already been appropriated or dedicated. It is not necessary in any eminent domain proceedings under this chapter to plead or prove any acts or proceedings preliminary or prior to the adoption of the resolution hereinbefore referred to describing the property sought to be taken and directing such proceedings.</p>

Any proceeds of such excise taxes required for these purposes must first be taken from that portion of the motor vehicle fund which results from the imposition of the excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels and which is distributed to the Puget Sound capital construction account. If the proceeds from excise taxes distributed to the state are ever insufficient to meet the required payments on principal or interest on the refunding bonds when due, the amount required to make the payments on the principal or interest must next be taken from that portion of the motor vehicle fund which results from the imposition of excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels and which is distributed to the state, counties, cities, and towns pursuant to RCW 46.68.090. Any payments of the principal or interest taken from the motor vehicle or special fuel tax revenues which are distributable to the counties, cities, and towns must be repaid from the first money distributed to the state not required for redemption of the refunding bonds or interest thereon. The legislature covenants that it will at all times provide sufficient revenues from the imposition of such excise taxes to pay the principal and interest due on the refunding bonds.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to use tolling to provide a source of transportation funding and to encourage effective use of the transportation system.</p>
<p>The legislature intends that the policy framework created by chapter 122, Laws of 2008 will guide subsequent legislation and decisions regarding the tolling of specific facilities and corridors. For each state-owned facility or corridor, the legislature intends that it will authorize the budget and finance plan. Specific issues that may be addressed in the finance plan and budget authorization legislation include the amount of financing required for a facility or corridor, the budget for any construction and operations financed by tolling, whether and how variable pricing will be applied, and the timing of tolling.</p>
<p>The legislature also intends that while the transportation commission, as the toll-setting authority, may set toll rates for facilities, corridors, or systems thereof, the legislature reserves the authority to impose tolls on any state transportation route or facility. Similarly, local or quasi-local entities that retain the power to impose tolls may do so as long as the effect of those tolls on the state highway system is consistent with the policy guidelines detailed in chapter 122, Laws of 2008. If the imposition of tolls could have an impact on state facilities, the state tolling authority must review and approve such tolls.</p>

<p>Any proposal for the establishment of eligible toll facilities shall consider the following policy guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Overall direction. Washington should use tolling to encourage effective use of the transportation system and provide a source of transportation funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When to use tolling. Tolling should be used when it can be demonstrated to contribute a significant portion of the cost of a project that cannot be funded solely with existing sources or optimize the performance of the transportation system. Such tolling should, in all cases, be fairly and equitably applied in the context of the statewide transportation system and not have significant adverse impacts through the diversion of traffic to other routes that cannot otherwise be reasonably mitigated. Such tolling should also consider relevant social equity, environmental, and economic issues, and should be directed at making progress toward the state's greenhouse gas reduction goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of toll revenue. All revenue from an eligible toll facility must be used only to improve, preserve, manage, or operate the eligible toll facility on or in which the revenue is collected. Additionally, toll revenue should provide for and encourage the inclusion of recycled and reclaimed construction materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting toll rates. Toll rates, which may include variable pricing, must be set to meet anticipated funding obligations. To the extent possible, the toll rates should be set to optimize system performance, recognizing necessary trade-offs to generate revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duration of toll collection. Because transportation infrastructure projects have costs and benefits that extend well beyond those paid for by initial construction funding, tolls on future toll facilities may remain in place to fund additional capacity, capital rehabilitation, maintenance, management, and operations, and to optimize performance of the system.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Review toll collection policies, toll operations policies, and toll revenue expenditures on the eligible toll facilities and report annually on this review to the legislature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tolling authority, in determining toll rates, shall consider the policy guidelines established in RCW 47.56.830.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise directed by the legislature, in setting and periodically adjusting toll rates, the tolling authority must ensure that toll rates will generate revenue sufficient to:</p>

<p>Meet the operating costs of the eligible toll facilities, including necessary maintenance, preservation, renewal, replacement, administration, and toll enforcement by public law enforcement;</p>

<p>The established toll rates may include variable pricing, and should be set to optimize system performance, recognizing necessary trade-offs to generate revenue for the purposes specified in subsection (3) of this section. Tolls may vary for type of vehicle, time of day, traffic conditions, or other factors designed to improve performance of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fixing and adjusting toll rates under this section, the only toll revenue to be taken into account must be toll revenue pledged to bonds that includes toll receipts, and the only debt service requirements to be taken into account must be debt service on bonds payable from and secured by toll revenue that includes toll receipts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature pledges to appropriate toll revenue as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. When the legislature has specifically identified and designated an eligible toll facility and authorized the issuance of bonds for the financing of the eligible toll facility that are payable from and secured by a pledge of toll revenue, the legislature further agrees for the benefit of the owners of outstanding bonds issued by the state for eligible toll facilities to continue in effect and not to impair or withdraw the authorization of the tolling authority to fix and adjust tolls as provided in this section. The state finance committee shall pledge the state's obligation to impose and maintain tolls, together with the application of toll revenue as described in this section, to the owners of any bonds.</p>

The legislature recognizes the need to reduce congestion and improve mobility on the Interstate 405 and state route number 167 corridors, and finds that performance on the corridors has not met the goal that average vehicle speeds in the express toll lanes remain above 45 miles per hour at least 90 percent of the time during peak hours. Therefore, the legislature intends that the commission reevaluate options at least every two years to improve performance on the Interstate 405 and state route number 167 corridors, pursuant to RCW 47.56.880 and 47.56.850.</p>
