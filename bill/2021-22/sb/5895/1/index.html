<p>The legislature finds that:</p>

<p>Remedial action grants are an effective means to assist a local government achieve toxic waste cleanup; and</p>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>The department may establish and administer a program to provide grants and loans to local governments for remedial actions, including planning for adaptive reuse of contaminated properties.  To expedite cleanups throughout the state, the department may use the following strategies when providing grants to local governments under this subsection:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enter into an extended grant agreement with a local government conducting remedial actions at a facility where those actions extend over multiple biennia and the total eligible cost of those actions exceeds <strong>$20,000,000</strong>. The agreement is subject to the following limitations:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The initial duration of such an agreement may not exceed <strong>10</strong> years. The department may extend the duration of such an agreement upon finding substantial progress has been made on remedial actions at the facility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended grant agreements may not exceed <strong>50</strong> percent of the total eligible remedial action costs at the facility; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not allocate future funding to an extended grant agreement unless the local government has demonstrated to the department that funds awarded under the agreement during the previous biennium have been substantially expended or contracts have been entered into to substantially expend the funds;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter into a grant agreement with a local government conducting a remedial action that provides for periodic reimbursement of remedial action costs as they are incurred as established in the agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter into a grant agreement with a local government prior to it acquiring a property or obtaining necessary access to conduct remedial actions, provided the agreement is conditioned upon the local government acquiring the property or obtaining the access in accordance with a schedule specified in the agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide integrated planning grants to local governments to fund studies necessary to facilitate remedial actions at brownfield properties and adaptive reuse of properties following remediation. Eligible activities include, but are not limited to: Environmental site assessments; remedial investigations; health assessments; feasibility studies; site planning; community involvement; land use and regulatory analyses; building and infrastructure assessments; economic and fiscal analyses; and any environmental analyses under chapter 43.21C RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide grants to local governments for remedial actions related to area-wide groundwater contamination. To receive the funding, the local government does not need to be a potentially liable person or be required to seek reimbursement of grant funds from a potentially liable person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may alter grant matching requirements to create incentives for local governments to expedite cleanups when one of the following conditions exists:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Funding would prevent or mitigate unfair economic hardship imposed by the clean‑up liability;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding would create new substantial economic development, public recreational opportunities, or habitat restoration opportunities that would not otherwise occur; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding would create an opportunity for acquisition and redevelopment of brownfield property under RCW 70A.305.040(5) that would not otherwise occur; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When pending grant applications under subsection (4)(d) and (e) of this section exceed the amount of funds available, designated redevelopment opportunity zones must receive priority for distribution of available funds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for unanticipated receipts under RCW 43.79.260 through 43.79.282, moneys in model toxics control capital account may be spent only after appropriation by statute.</p>
</li>
</ol>
