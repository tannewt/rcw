<p>The term of the sentence of an offender committed to a correctional facility operated by the department may be reduced by earned release time in accordance with procedures that shall be developed and adopted by the correctional agency having jurisdiction in which the offender is confined. The earned release time shall be for good behavior and good performance, as determined by the correctional agency having jurisdiction. The correctional agency shall not credit the offender with earned release credits in advance of the offender actually earning the credits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any program established pursuant to this section shall allow an offender to earn early release credits for presentence incarceration. If an offender is transferred from a county jail to the department, the administrator of a county jail facility shall certify to the department the amount of time spent in custody at the facility and the number of days of early release credits lost or not earned. The department may approve a jail certification from a correctional agency that calculates early release time based on the actual amount of confinement time served by the offender before sentencing when an erroneous calculation of confinement time served by the offender before sentencing appears on the judgment and sentence. The department must adjust an offender's rate of early release listed on the jail certification to be consistent with the rate applicable to offenders in the department's facilities. However, the department is not authorized to adjust the number of presentence early release days that the jail has certified as lost or not earned.</p>

<p>An offender may earn early release time as follows:</p>
<pre><code>a. In the case of an offender sentenced pursuant to RCW 10.95.030(3) or 10.95.035, the offender may not receive any earned early release time during the minimum term of confinement imposed by the court; for any remaining portion of the sentence served by the offender, the aggregate earned release time may not exceed **one-third** of the sentence.

b. In the case of an offender convicted of a serious violent offense, or a sex offense that is a class A felony, committed on or after July 1, 1990, and before July 1, 2003, the aggregate earned release time may not exceed **one-third** of the sentence.

c. In the case of an offender convicted of a serious violent offense, or a sex offense that is a class A felony, committed on or after July 1, 2003, the aggregate earned release time may not exceed **one-third** of the sentence.

<h2 id="section-3-721">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-721">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pursuant to RCW 9.94A.729, the department of corrections shall recalculate the earned release date for any offender currently serving a term in a facility or institution either operated by the state or utilized under contract. The earned release date shall be recalculated whether the offender is currently incarcerated or is sentenced after the effective date of this section, and regardless of the offender's date of offense. For offenders whose offense was committed prior to the effective date of this section, the recalculation shall not extend a term of incarceration beyond that to which an offender is currently subject. This act applies retroactively and prospectively, regardless of the date of an offender's underlying offense.</p>
<h2 id="section-4-542">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-542">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department of corrections' recalculations of earned time pursuant to sections 1 and 2 of this act do not create any expectations that the percentage of earned release time will be revised before July 1, 2021, and offenders have no reason to conclude that the maximum percentage of earned release time is an entitlement or creates any liberty interest. The department of corrections is authorized to take the time reasonably necessary to complete the recalculations of earned release time after the effective date of this section.</p>
