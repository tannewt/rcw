<p>Recognizing the importance of close coordination and partnership between the department of ecology and municipal treatment plants, the department shall form an advisory committee, appointed by the director of ecology or the director's designee, to create recommendations for adjusting the fee schedule for permits authorized by RCW 90.48.162 and 90.48.165 by rule. The advisory committee must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Two representatives of permitted facilities representing communities of 25,000 or fewer in population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two representatives of permitted facilities representing communities greater than 25,000 in population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two representatives representing nonprofit environmental organizations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One representative of a statewide association representing cities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One representative of a statewide association representing counties; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One representative of a statewide business association.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 31, 2022, the advisory committee must submit recommendations to the department of ecology that will identify fees needed to fully recover expenses incurred by the department of ecology to administer municipal wastewater permits, to include permit writing and public review, inspections and technical assistance, discharge monitoring reporting and data support, and supporting the overhead expenses related to administering the wastewater discharge permits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The advisory committee recommendations must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Assess the municipal wastewater permitting backlogs and permit workloads;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess service levels required to meet state and federal legal mandates and the needs of permittees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess the staffing and revenue needed to support those service levels; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommend how to structure the underlying permit fees and the timing and sequence of fee adjustments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of ecology must use these recommendations as the basis for updates in 2023 to the water quality permit fees set in chapter 173-224 WAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section expires January 1, 2024.</p>
