<h2 id="section-1-1665">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1665">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that railroad employees are susceptible to illness from working in confined spaces as well as the illnesses and injuries that affect the general population, yet have no paid sick leave and may be subject to discipline for absence due to illness and injury. Further, the legislature recognizes that chronic fatigue is endemic to railroad operating craft employees due to erratic work schedules, inaccurate train line up information, and on duty periods of twelve hours or longer. Academic studies have found that fatigue has the equivalent negative impact on alertness, awareness, and job performance as alcohol intoxication. Research indicates that fatigue is related to higher rates of depression, anxiety, sleep apnea, and suicide, and that these work-related conditions are more prevalent among railroad workers. The federal railway safety improvement act of 2008 directed the appropriate federal agencies to address fatigue, but those agencies have not adequately done so.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that railroad operating craft employees may report to work while ill or fatigued to avoid disciplinary action by railroad carrier companies, which creates a dangerous and unnecessary public safety issue. In addition, the legislature finds that the unique operational practices utilized to summon railroad crew employees to duty necessitate modifications to existing family and medical leave laws to provide railroad carrier employees with comparable sick leave and family leave rights to those previously granted to all other workers in this state.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the interest of public safety and railroad worker safety, the legislature intends to take steps to assure that railroad crew employees are healthy and rested and to assure that railroad crew employees receive fair family and medical leave.</p>
