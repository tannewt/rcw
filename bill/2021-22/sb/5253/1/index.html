<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this act is to implement the recommendations of the pollinator health task force created by section 3, chapter 353, Laws of 2019, entitled &quot;Recommendations of the Pollinator Health Task Force - for Pollinator Health in Washington&quot; (November 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force provided recommendations to help prioritize and enact policy changes for pollinators in Washington. The recommendations are organized under five broad categories: (a) Habitat; (b) pesticides; (c) education; (d) managed pollinators; and (e) research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force met for the first time the same week that the Asian giant hornet was first discovered in Washington and the week after the Houdini fly was also reported for the first time in Washington. Asian giant hornets primarily hunt honey bees and destroy entire honey bee hives. The Houdini fly threatens native mason bee populations as well as managed mason bees. Washington is home to over 400 different species of native bees, 65 species of butterflies, as well as moths, wasps, beetles, flies, and hummingbirds. The loss of pollinators, managed and unmanaged, can lead to decreased yields of many fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Washington is currently the top producer in the United States of apples, sweet cherries, alfalfa, blueberries, and pears. In Washington state, honey bees and other pollinators are responsible for the production of tree fruits, small fruits, and other crops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to clarify and update the description of farm and agricultural land as it is used under the property tax open space program. The inclusion of pollinator habitat to the definition of &quot;open space land&quot; is designed to clarify that the protection of pollinator habitat be included in the description of farm and agriculture land as it is used under the property tax open space program. The amendments to RCW 84.34.020, as provided in section 10 of this act, are intended to clarify an ambiguity in an existing tax preference, and are therefore exempt from the requirements of RCW 82.32.805 and 82.32.808.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends by this act to implement various recommendations from the pollinator health task force to protect and expand the habitat upon which pollinators depend, by providing technical and financial assistance to public and private landowners, and by coordinating with state agencies and local governments in promoting practices to ensure sustainable, healthy populations of managed and native pollinators.</p>
