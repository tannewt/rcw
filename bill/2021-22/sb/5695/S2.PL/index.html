<h2 id="section-1-1363">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1363">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act may be known and cited as the drug free prisons act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-1080">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1080">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the department of corrections is responsible for enhancing public safety through the operation of safe and secure facilities. The legislature recognizes that safe and secure facilities improve safety and well-being for those experiencing incarceration, departmental employees, visitors, and volunteers. The legislature recognizes that one of the greatest risks to operating safe and secure facilities is the introduction and movement of contraband, including but not limited to alcohol and drugs. The legislature recognizes that undiagnosed, untreated, or unaddressed substance use disorder can lead to increased rates of recidivism. Therefore, the legislature intends to protect human dignity by reducing or eliminating strip searches, and to increase public safety by reducing access to drugs and alcohol in correctional facilities and to increase substance use disorder diagnosis, treatment, and services.</p>
