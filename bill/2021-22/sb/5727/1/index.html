<p>This act shall be known and cited as the Lorraine Loomis act.</p>
<h2 id="section-102">Section 102 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-102">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that riparian areas are the fulcrum for the cycle of life of aquatic species and many terrestrial wildlife species and that the health of all Washingtonians depends upon healthy riparian areas. These areas provide multibenefit ecosystem services such as water purification, water storage, large woody debris, flood protection, critical fish and wildlife migration, food supply and foraging, and in-stream and terrestrial cover habitats, and fisheries and, by interacting with watershed-scale processes, they contribute to the creation and maintenance of aquatic habitats. The zone of influence for the health of riparian ecosystems encompasses the active floodplain, including riverine wetlands and terraces, and the adjacent uplands that contribute matter and energy to the active channel or active floodplain. Scientists, including those who developed the Washington state department of fish and wildlife's Riparian Ecosystems Volume 1 and 2, which is accepted as the best available science in Washington state, estimate the width of a properly functioning riparian ecosystem for most streams and rivers in the state to be site potential tree height, and that protecting and restoring the conditions within this area is necessary to protect and maintain the full, healthy function of the riparian ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that salmon are an indicator species dependent upon fully functioning, healthy riparian areas, and as wild salmon decline, it foretells the decline of the water quality and all other species in our aquatic systems. Salmon play a major role in our state's wildlife diversity and cultural heritage. Salmon are the keystone species to 137 other animals, including orcas and bears. Bold reforms and strategies that encompass solutions to many, if not all, of the causes behind salmon depletion are needed. Protecting our salmon is a priority for all Washingtonians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that for thousands of years salmon have shaped the lives of the people who have lived here since time immemorial. Native nations of the Pacific Northwest define themselves as salmon people. The cultures, intertribal interactions, fishing technologies and negotiations, and the very spiritual ways of the Pacific Northwest tribes were and are all impacted and influenced by salmon. These lifeways have been at risk for some time and urgent action is required. As Billy Frank Jr. said almost 20 years ago, &quot;As the salmon disappear, so do our cultures and treaty rights. We are at a crossroads and we are running out of time.&quot; And, in the words of Swinomish elder, Billy Frank Jr.'s close friend and true salmon warrior, Lorraine Loomis, &quot;Salmon is food for our bodies and our spirits. For us, salmon is not optional. It is essential.&quot; &quot;None of us tribal natural resources managers are working for today. We are all working for tomorrow. We are working to make certain there will be salmon for the next seven generations.&quot; Northwest Indian fisheries commission chair Loomis was the key to the development and implementation of the vitally important natural resource management process and kept the protection and restoration of critical habitat at the forefront of those efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the effects of climate change on these special habitats and ecosystem services will be especially profound, due to altered snowpack and hydrologic regimes that are already occurring, and negative impacts are predicted to increase over time. Warming weather due to climate change has vastly increased the temperature of freshwater streams, making salmon more susceptible to predators, parasites, disease, and mortality. The functionality of many riparian ecosystems is already compromised by water diversions, agricultural and livestock practices, development, and population growth, all of which reduce the salmon's resilience to additional stresses that warmer water and a warmer climate brings. Over the next century, climate change will dramatically alter natural resource management. Because riparian ecosystems and the projected impacts of climate change are highly variable geographically, there is an urgent need to take place-based actions to respond to the impacts and threats of climate change to salmon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the federal, state, and local governments and tribes must continue the important work of addressing all activities limiting the recovery of wild salmon, without protecting and restoring riparian habitat and watershed functions necessary for their survival, there is no reasonable prospect of achieving such a recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For these reasons, the legislature intends to act now, with needed urgency, to establish and implement a comprehensive program to protect and restore riparian habitat upon which salmon and other aquatic species depend by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Requiring the riparian management zone standard in defining the areas in which riparian functions must be protected and restored, and applying this statewide standard to state and local land use planning, permitting and incentive programs, water quality protection, enforcement of regulatory programs, and financial and technical assistance programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring inclusion and integration of salmon recovery goals, strategies, and actions in all elements of comprehensive plans including, but not limited to, land use plans, capital facilities plans, development regulations, and shoreline master programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopting more protective standards applicable to shoreline armoring;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing financial incentives for restoration of riparian and shoreline habitats;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing liability protection for permitting of habitat restoration work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring mapping, monitoring, and regular review and assessment of watershed functions including riparian habitat in all watersheds;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing state funding of habitat restoration and protection projects, planning, and program implementation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing state resources devoted to habitat and water quality monitoring and enforcement, with the priority placed upon watersheds failing to meet progress goals in habitat protection and restoration.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-201">Section 201 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-201">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the policy of the state to protect, restore, and maintain properly functioning riparian management zones and ecosystems to aid in recovering threatened and endangered salmon to abundant harvestable levels, prevent new listings of salmon populations as threatened or endangered, prevent extirpation of remaining salmon populations, and restore and protect water quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The restoration and permanent protection of riparian management zones and ecosystems must occur at a significantly increased pace sufficient to address declining salmon populations, protect critical habitat for salmon and steelhead, protect and restore water quality, and prevent long-term impacts to the economy and well-being of Washington state.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The salmon recovery funding board shall develop and implement a statewide riparian habitat conservation grant program to protect and restore riparian management zones and ecosystems and as an opportunity to cost share with landowners as described in section 302 of this act. The board may establish criteria for determining when block grants may be made for purposes of distributing funds to the highest priority watersheds based on the department's prioritization process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The riparian habitat conservation grant program must be funded with state or federal funds set aside explicitly for riparian habitat in the salmon recovery account under RCW 77.85.170. The riparian funds must be separate from state salmon recovery funding board or federal pacific coastal salmon recovery funds for lead entity salmon recovery projects. Riparian projects are eligible for funding under the riparian grant program where consistent with the department's riparian management zone maps and the department's best available science standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The salmon recovery funding board, with input from the state/tribal riparian management oversight committee established in section 701 of this act, may prioritize funding for riparian restoration projects in watersheds prioritized in accordance with section 205 of this act and where progress goals established by the department have not been met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding may only be provided in watersheds in which riparian management zone maps are complete.</p>

<h2 id="section-302">Section 302 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-302">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>In priority watersheds, the department shall provide landowners with an offer of grant funding to assist in implementation of the requirements of this chapter. The cost-sharing offer may come from a state agency, board, office, or commission where the department determines that the offer meets the conditions of this section.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. A cost-share offer must cover at least 70 percent of the landowner's cost to establish and maintain the riparian management zone, or 90 percent of the landowner's cost if there is an economic hardship.</p>
<p>3. A landowner's cost to establish and maintain a riparian management zone includes all of the following that apply:</p>
<pre><code>a. Costs to establish or enhance a riparian management zone or to provide temporary cover until a permanent riparian management zone is established. This may include costs for mulch, fertilizer, seed, seedling trees, and other necessary materials;

b. The reasonable value of necessary labor, equipment, fencing, and supplies to establish the riparian management zone; and

c. The reasonable value of necessary yearly maintenance costs, up to a maximum of five years.
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>If a landowner must remove more than .5 acre of riparian land from agricultural production, the cost-share offer must include part of the cost of removing that land from production. The amount must be at least equal to the amount that would be offered under the conservation reserve enhancement program if the affected lands were enrolled in that program for 10 years, regardless of whether the lands are actually eligible for the conservation reserve enhancement program. This subsection does not apply unless the landowner agrees to keep the riparian management zone out of agricultural production in perpetuity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A grant from any public or private source, or combination of sources, may be counted as part of a cost-share grant under subsection (1) of this section. A loan is not a grant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before making a determination of a bona fide offer of cost sharing to the landowner, the department must provide 30 days' notice in writing of their intent to make a determination of a bona fide offer under subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section limits the authority of a state agency, local government, or landowner to carry out its obligations under other federal, state, or local law.</p>
