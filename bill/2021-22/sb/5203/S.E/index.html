The consortium's purchasing activities shall be based upon the evidence-based prescription drug program established under RCW 70.14.050. <strong>Except as provided in section 1 of this act or exempted under (b) of this subsection, state</strong> purchased health care programs as defined in RCW 41.05.011 shall purchase prescription drugs through the consortium for those prescription drugs that are purchased directly by the state and those that are purchased through reimbursement of pharmacies.
