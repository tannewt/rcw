<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.04_business_and_occupation_tax.html">82.04.4451</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.04_business_and_occupation_tax.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed against the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter, as provided in this section. Except for taxpayers that report at least <strong>50</strong> percent of their taxable amount under RCW 82.04.255, 82.04.290(2)(a), and 82.04.285, the maximum credit for a taxpayer for a reporting period is <strong>$55</strong> multiplied by the number of months in the reporting period, as determined under RCW 82.32.045. For a taxpayer that reports at least <strong>50</strong> percent of its taxable amount under RCW 82.04.255, 82.04.290(2)(a), and 82.04.285, the maximum credit for a reporting period is <strong>$160</strong> multiplied by the number of months in the reporting period, as determined under RCW 82.32.045.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter is equal to or less than the maximum credit, a credit is allowed equal to the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter exceeds the maximum credit, a reduced credit is allowed equal to twice the maximum credit, minus the tax otherwise due under this chapter, but not less than zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may prepare a tax credit table consisting of tax ranges using increments of no more than five dollars and a corresponding tax credit to be applied to those tax ranges. The table shall be prepared in such a manner that no taxpayer will owe a greater amount of tax by using the table than would be owed by performing the calculation under subsections (1) through (3) of this section. A table prepared by the department under this subsection must be used by all taxpayers in taking the credit provided in this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
