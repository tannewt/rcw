<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference and incentives created under RCW 82.16.130 and section 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference and incentives. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes the tax preference created under RCW 82.16.130 and incentive payments authorized in section 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. as intended to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Induce participating utilities to make incentive payments to utility customers who invest in renewable energy systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Increase the number of jobs in and enhance the sustainability of the clean energy technology industry in Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's intent to provide the incentives in section 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. and RCW 82.16.130 in order to ensure the sustainable job growth and vitality of the state's renewable energy sector. The purpose of the incentive is to reduce the costs associated with installing and operating solar energy systems by persons or entities receiving the incentive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of its 2021 tax preference reviews, the joint legislative audit and review committee must review the tax preferences and incentives in section 6, chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. and RCW 82.16.130. The legislature intends for the legislative auditor to determine that the incentive has achieved its desired outcomes if the following objectives are achieved:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Installation of one hundred fifteen megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity by participants in the incentive program between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2021; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth of solar-related employment from 2015 levels, as evidenced by:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An increased per capita rate of solar energy-related jobs in Washington, which may be determined by consulting a relevant trade association in the state; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achievement of an improved national ranking for solar energy-related employment and per capita solar energy-related employment, as reported in a nationally recognized report.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to data collected by the Washington State University extension energy program and may obtain employment data from the employment security department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington State University extension energy program must collect, through the application process, data from persons claiming the tax credit under RCW 82.16.130 and persons receiving the incentive payments created in RCW 82.16.165, as necessary, and may collect data from other interested persons as necessary to report on the performance of chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All recipients of tax credits or incentive payments awarded under this chapter must provide data necessary to evaluate the tax preference performance objectives in this section as requested by the Washington State University extension energy program or the joint legislative audit and review committee.

<p>Current production projections and a description of the methodology used to develop the projections;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact information for questions and complaints; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other terms and conditions of the services provided by the administrator.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A utility may not adopt rates, terms, conditions, or standards that unduly or unreasonably discriminate between utility-administered community solar projects and those administered by another entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public utility district that is engaged in distributing electricity to more than one retail electric customer in the state and a joint operating agency organized under chapter 43.52 RCW on or before January 1, 2017, may enter into an agreement with each other to construct and own a community solar project that is located on property owned by a joint operating agency or on property that receives electric service from a participating public utility district. Each participant of a community solar project under this subsection must be a customer of at least one of the public utility districts that is a party to the agreement with a joint operating agency to construct and own a community solar project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington utilities and transportation commission must publish, without disclosing proprietary information, a list of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Entities other than utilities, including affiliates or subsidiaries of utilities, that organize and administer community solar projects; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community solar projects and related programs and services offered by investor-owned utilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a consumer-owned utility opts to provide a community solar program or contracts with a nonutility administrator to offer a community solar program, the governing body of the consumer-owned utility must publish, without disclosing proprietary information, a list of the nonutility administrators contracted by the utility as part of its community solar program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for parties engaged in actions and transactions regulated under laws administered by other authorities and exempted under RCW 19.86.170, a violation of this section constitutes an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce in violation of chapter 19.86 RCW, the consumer protection act.

<li>
<p>The purpose of a shared commercial solar project is to provide an entry point in solar utilization by large load customers in a manner that achieves economies of scale and maximizes system performance without limitations posed by on-site systems where sun exposure is not optimal or structural and other site deficiencies preclude solar development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2017, a utility may, at its discretion, organize and administer a shared commercial solar project as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A shared commercial solar project must have a direct current nameplate capacity greater than one megawatt and no more than five megawatts and must have at least five participants. To receive incentive payments under RCW 82.16.165, each participant must be a customer of the utility providing service at the situs of the shared commercial solar project and must be located in the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrator of a shared commercial solar project must administer the project in a transparent manner.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In order to meet the intent of chapter 36, Laws of 2017 3rd sp. sess. of promoting a sustainable, local renewable energy industry, the legislature prefers award of the majority of the installation of shared commercial solar projects be given to contractors based in Washington state. In the event the majority of the installation of a shared commercial solar project is awarded to out-of-state contractors, the administrator must submit to the Washington State University extension energy program the reasons for using out-of-state contractors, the percentage of installation work performed by out-of-state contractors, and a cost comparison of the installation services performed by out-of-state contractors against the same services performed by Washington-based contractors.</p>
