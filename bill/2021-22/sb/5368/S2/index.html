<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/35A_optional_municipal_code/35A.14_annexation_by_code_cities.html">35A.14</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/35A_optional_municipal_code/35A.14_annexation_by_code_cities.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<li>
<p>A code city as provided in RCW 35A.14.296(2) may collaborate with the county or counties where the code city is located to form an interlocal agreement regarding annexation of unincorporated territory within the urban growth area boundary. The interlocal agreement formation process must include procedures for public participation. The procedures must provide for broad dissemination of proposals and alternatives, opportunity for written comments, public meetings after effective notice, and consideration of and response to public comments. The interlocal agreement may only be executed after notice of availability of the agreement is posted on the website of each legislative body for four weeks and a public hearing by each legislative body, separately or jointly. This method of annexation shall be an alternative method and is additional to all other methods provided for in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interlocal agreement under this section will qualify the city for the annexation sales tax credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agreement or plan under this section must address the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A balancing of annexations of commercial, industrial, and residential properties so that any potential loss or gain is considered and distributed fairly as determined by tax revenue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development, ownership, and maintenance of infrastructure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential for revenue-sharing agreements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addressing the items in subsection (3)(a) through (c) of this section, the parties must also address the balancing of factors and objectives for annexation review in RCW 36.93.170 and 36.93.180.</p>

<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy, the department shall:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Provide notice to and opportunity for written comment by all interested parties of record as a part of the local government review process for the proposal and to all persons, groups, and agencies that have requested in writing notice of the proposed action. The comment period shall be at least 30 days, unless the department determines that the level of complexity or controversy involved supports a shorter period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the department's discretion, conduct a public hearing during the 30-day comment period in the jurisdiction proposing the comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 15 days after the close of public comment, request the local government to review the issues identified by the public, interested parties, groups, and agencies and provide a written response as to how the proposal addresses the identified issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 30 days after receipt of the local government response pursuant to (a)(iii) of this subsection, make written findings and conclusions regarding the consistency of the proposal with the goals and requirements of the growth management act and with applicable guidelines and procedural criteria adopted by the department, provide a response to the issues identified in (a)(iii) of this subsection, and either approve the comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy as submitted, recommend specific changes necessary to make the comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy approvable, or deny approval of the comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy in those instances where no alternative comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy appears likely to be consistent with the goals and requirements of the growth management act and with applicable guidelines and procedural criteria adopted by the department. The written findings and conclusions shall be provided to the local government, and made available to all interested persons, parties, groups, and agencies of record on the proposal.</p>

<p>Agree to the proposed changes by written notice to the department; or</p>
</li>

<p>Submit an alternative comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy. If, in the opinion of the department, the alternative is consistent with the purpose and intent of the changes originally submitted by the department and with this chapter, it shall approve the changes and provide notice to all recipients of the written findings and conclusions. If the department determines the proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy is not consistent with the purpose and intent of the changes proposed by the department, the department may resubmit the proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy for public and agency review pursuant to this section or reject the proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall approve a proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy unless it determines that the proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy is not consistent with the goals and requirements of the growth management act and with applicable guidelines and procedural criteria adopted by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy takes effect when and in such form as approved or adopted by the department. The effective date is 14 days from the date of the department's written notice of final action to the local government stating the department has approved or rejected the proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy. The department's written notice to the local government must conspicuously and plainly state that it is the department's final decision and that there will be no further modifications to the proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy. The department shall maintain a record of each comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy, the action taken on any proposed comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy, and any appeal of the department's action.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A decision of the growth management hearings board concerning an appeal of the department's final decision to approve or reject a proposed greenhouse gas emissions reduction subelement or amendment must be based solely on whether or not the adopted comprehensive plan, development regulation, or countywide planning policy complies with the goals and requirements of the growth management act and with applicable guidelines and procedural criteria adopted by the department, or chapter 43.21C RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If approval of a determination of compliance by the department under this section is appealed to the growth management hearings board under RCW 36.70A.280, the city or county may not be determined to be ineligible or otherwise penalized in the acceptance of applications or the awarding of state agency grants or loans under RCW 43.17.250 during the pendency of the appeal before the board or subsequent judicial appeals.</p>
