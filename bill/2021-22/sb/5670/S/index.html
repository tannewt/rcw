Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.</p>

For the purposes of this section, a &quot;countywide planning policy&quot; is a written policy statement or statements used solely for establishing a countywide framework from which county and city comprehensive plans are developed and adopted pursuant to this chapter. This framework shall ensure that city and county comprehensive plans are consistent as required in RCW 36.70A.100. Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the land-use powers of cities.</p>

In other counties that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, this meeting shall be convened no later than sixty days after the date the county adopts its resolution of intention or was certified by the office of financial management.</p>
