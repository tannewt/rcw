<p>&quot;Earnable compensation&quot; for plan 1 members, means:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>All salaries and wages paid by an employer to an employee member of the retirement system for personal services rendered during a fiscal year. In all cases where compensation includes maintenance the employer shall fix the value of that part of the compensation not paid in money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an employee member of the retirement system teaching in an extended school year program, two consecutive extended school years, as defined by the employer school district, may be used as the annual period for determining earnable compensation in lieu of the two fiscal years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Earnable compensation&quot; for plan 1 members also includes the following actual or imputed payments, which are not paid for personal services:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Retroactive payments to an individual by an employer on reinstatement of the employee in a position, or payments by an employer to an individual in lieu of reinstatement in a position which are awarded or granted as the equivalent of the salary or wages which the individual would have earned during a payroll period shall be considered earnable compensation and the individual shall receive the equivalent service credit.</p>
<p>(B) If a leave of absence, without pay, is taken by a member for the purpose of serving as a member of the state legislature, and such member has served in the legislature five or more years, the salary which would have been received for the position from which the leave of absence was taken shall be considered as compensation earnable if the employee's contribution thereon is paid by the employee. In addition, where a member has been a member of the state legislature for five or more years, earnable compensation for the member's two highest compensated consecutive years of service shall include a sum not to exceed thirty-six hundred dollars for each of such two consecutive years, regardless of whether or not legislative service was rendered during those two years.</p>
<pre><code>    iv. For members employed less than full time under written contract with a school district, or community college district, in an instructional position, for which the member receives service credit of less than one year in all of the years used to determine the earnable compensation used for computing benefits due under RCW 41.32.497, 41.32.498, and 41.32.520, the member may elect to have earnable compensation defined as provided in RCW 41.32.345. For the purposes of this subsection, the term &quot;instructional position&quot; means a position in which more than seventy-five percent of the member's time is spent as a classroom instructor (including office hours), a librarian, a psychologist, a social worker, a nurse, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a speech language pathologist or audiologist, or a counselor. Earnable compensation shall be so defined only for the purpose of the calculation of retirement benefits and only as necessary to insure that members who receive fractional service credit under RCW 41.32.270 receive benefits proportional to those received by members who have received full-time service credit.

v. &quot;Earnable compensation&quot; does not include:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Remuneration for unused sick leave authorized under RCW 41.04.340, 28A.400.210, or 28A.310.490;</p>
<p>(B) Remuneration for unused annual leave in excess of two hundred forty hours as authorized by RCW 43.01.044 and 43.01.041.</p>
<pre><code>b. &quot;Earnable compensation&quot; for plan 2 and plan 3 members, means salaries or wages earned by a member during a payroll period for personal services, including overtime payments, and shall include wages and salaries deferred under provisions established pursuant to sections 403(b), 414(h), and 457 of the United States Internal Revenue Code, but shall exclude lump sum payments for deferred annual sick leave, unused accumulated vacation, unused accumulated annual leave, or any form of severance pay.
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Earnable compensation&quot; for plan 2 and plan 3 members also includes the following actual or imputed payments which, except in the case of (b)(ii)(B) of this subsection, are not paid for personal services:</p>
<pre><code>    i. Retroactive payments to an individual by an employer on reinstatement of the employee in a position or payments by an employer to an individual in lieu of reinstatement in a position which are awarded or granted as the equivalent of the salary or wages which the individual would have earned during a payroll period shall be considered earnable compensation, to the extent provided above, and the individual shall receive the equivalent service credit.

    ii. In any year in which a member serves in the legislature the member shall have the option of having such member's earnable compensation be the greater of:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The earnable compensation the member would have received had such member not served in the legislature; or</p>
<p>(B) Such member's actual earnable compensation received for teaching and legislative service combined. Any additional contributions to the retirement system required because compensation earnable under (b)(ii)(A) of this subsection is greater than compensation earnable under (b)(ii)(B) of this subsection shall be paid by the member for both member and employer contributions.</p>
<pre><code>c. In calculating earnable compensation under (a) or (b) of this subsection, the department of retirement systems shall include:

    i. Any compensation forgone by a member employed by a state agency or institution during the 2009-2011 fiscal biennium as a result of reduced work hours, mandatory or voluntary leave without pay, temporary reduction in pay implemented prior to December 11, 2010, or temporary layoffs if the reduced compensation is an integral part of the employer's expenditure reduction efforts, as certified by the employer;

    ii. Any compensation forgone by a member during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium as a result of reduced work hours, mandatory leave without pay, temporary layoffs, or reductions to current pay if the reduced compensation is an integral part of the employer's expenditure reduction efforts, as certified by the employer. Reductions to current pay shall not include elimination of previously agreed upon future salary reductions**; and**

    iii. **Any compensation forgone by a member during the 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia as a result of reduced work hours, mandatory leave without pay, temporary layoffs, furloughs, reductions to current pay, or other similar measures resulting from the COVID-19 budgetary crisis, if the reduced compensation is an integral part of the employer's expenditure reduction efforts, as certified by the employer.

Here is the <a href="rcw/41_public_employment_civil_service_and_pensions/41.50_department_of_retirement_systems.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<p>With respect to plans administered by the department:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If an employer participates in the shared work program under chapter 50.60 RCW, any reduction in hours worked by a member as a result of the employer's participation in the program does not impact the retirement benefit the member would otherwise be entitled to receive had the member's hours not been reduced. A member's benefit will be calculated as if the member did not incur a reduction in hours through participating in an approved shared work compensation plan under chapter 50.60 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not apply to deferred compensation plans.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>This section applies both prospectively and retroactively to July 28, 2013, the date that chapter 79, Laws of 2013 became effective.</p>
