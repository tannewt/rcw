<p>Since the inception of the legal, regulated marketplace for cannabis in Washington state, the industry across the United States continues to innovate and evolve. The legislature finds that while the legal, regulated industry has striven to provide safe products to consumers, the illicit market has continued to find ways to avoid regulation, resulting in unregulated, untested, and potentially unsafe products available outside of the regulated market. Due to this and the evolving nature of new cannabinoids identified in the Cannabis sativa L. plant, the legislature finds there is a need to provide consumers legal access to safe products in the regulated cannabis market. The legislature further finds there is a need to ensure appropriate labeling, serving size, and disclosure standards for any regulated cannabinoid. The legislature intends to create a robust regulatory framework for naturally occurring cannabinoids found in the Cannabis sativa L. plant while allowing continued innovation in the regulated market.</p>

<p>A marijuana retailer's license is subject to forfeiture in accordance with rules adopted by the board pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall adopt rules to establish a license forfeiture process for a licensed marijuana retailer that is not fully operational and open to the public within a specified period from the date of license issuance, as established by the board, subject to the following restrictions:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) No marijuana retailer's license may be subject to forfeiture within the first nine months of license issuance; and</p>
<p>(B) The board must require license forfeiture on or before twenty-four calendar months of license issuance if a marijuana retailer is not fully operational and open to the public, unless the board determines that circumstances out of the licensee's control are preventing the licensee from becoming fully operational and that, in the board's discretion, the circumstances warrant extending the forfeiture period beyond twenty-four calendar months.</p>
<pre><code>    iii. The board has discretion in adopting rules under this subsection (3)(c).

    iv. This subsection (3)(c) applies to marijuana retailer's licenses issued before and after July 23, 2017. However, no license of a marijuana retailer that otherwise meets the conditions for license forfeiture established pursuant to this subsection (3)(c) may be subject to forfeiture within the first nine calendar months of July 23, 2017.

v. The board may not require license forfeiture if the licensee has been incapable of opening a fully operational retail marijuana business due to actions by the city, town, or county with jurisdiction over the licensee that include any of the following:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The adoption of a ban or moratorium that prohibits the opening of a retail marijuana business; or</p>
<p>(B) The adoption of an ordinance or regulation related to zoning, business licensing, land use, or other regulatory measure that has the effect of preventing a licensee from receiving an occupancy permit from the jurisdiction or which otherwise prevents a licensed marijuana retailer from becoming operational.</p>
