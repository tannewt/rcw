<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is a need to dramatically improve data collection surrounding violence, domestic violence, and deaths in the state of Washington. Justice agencies in the state, including courts, law enforcement, corrections, and prosecutors, possess a wealth of data relating to the public health of Washington citizens. A centralized data repository will create data linkages between legal and public health data sets. These linkages will promote a public health response to violent crime and deaths, and give the legislature valuable tools in formulating public policy surrounding these important issues.</p>
