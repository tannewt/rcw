<p>There is established in the office of the superintendent of public instruction an administrative section or unit for the education of children with disabilities who require special education.</p>
<p>Students with disabilities are those children whether enrolled in school or not who through an evaluation process are determined eligible for special education due to a disability.</p>
<p>In accordance with part B of the federal individuals with disabilities education improvement act and any other federal or state laws relating to the provision of special education services, the superintendent of public instruction shall require each school district in the state to insure an appropriate educational opportunity for all children with disabilities between the ages of three and twenty-one, but when the twenty-first birthday occurs during the school year, the educational program may be continued until the end of that school year. The superintendent of public instruction, by rule, shall establish for the purpose of excess cost funding, as provided in RCW 28A.150.390, 28A.160.030, and 28A.155.010 through 28A.155.160, functional definitions of special education, the various types of disabling conditions, and eligibility criteria for special education programs for children with disabilities, including referral procedures, use of positive behavior interventions, the education curriculum and statewide or district-wide assessments, parent and district requests for special education due process hearings, and procedural safeguards. For the purposes of RCW 28A.155.010 through 28A.155.160, an appropriate education is defined as an education directed to the unique needs, abilities, and limitations of the children with disabilities who are enrolled either full time or part time in a school district. School districts are strongly encouraged to provide parental training in the care and education of the children and to involve parents in the classroom.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section shall prohibit the establishment or continuation of existing cooperative programs between school districts or contracts with other agencies approved by the superintendent of public instruction, which can meet the obligations of school districts to provide education for children with disabilities, or prohibit the continuation of needed related services to school districts by the department of social and health services.</p>
<p>This section shall not be construed as in any way limiting the powers of local school districts set forth in RCW 28A.155.070.</p>

The purpose of the interagency agreements is to foster effective collaboration among the multiple agencies providing transition services for individualized education program-eligible special education students from the beginning of transition planning, as soon as educationally and developmentally appropriate, through age twenty-one, or through high school graduation, whichever occurs first. Interagency agreements are also intended to streamline services and programs, promote efficiencies, and establish a uniform focus on improved outcomes related to self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>When educationally and developmentally appropriate, the interagency responsibilities and linkages with transition services under subsection (1) of this section must be addressed in a transition plan to a postsecondary setting in the individualized education program of a student with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition planning shall be based upon educationally and developmentally appropriate transition assessments that outline the student's individual needs, strengths, preferences, and interests. Transition assessments may include observations, interviews, inventories, situational assessments, formal and informal assessments, as well as academic assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transition services that the transition plan must address include activities needed to assist the student in reaching postsecondary goals and courses of study to support postsecondary goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition activities that the transition plan may address include instruction, related services, community experience, employment and other adult living objectives, daily living skills, and functional vocational evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When educationally and developmentally appropriate, a discussion must take place with the student and parents, and others as needed, to determine the postsecondary goals or postschool vision for the student. This discussion may be included as part of an annual individualized education program review, high school and beyond plan meeting, or any other meeting that includes parents, students, and educators. The postsecondary goals included in the transition plan shall be goals that are measurable and must be based on appropriate transition assessments related to training, education, employment, and independent living skills, when necessary. The goals must also be based on the student's needs, while considering the strengths, preferences, and interests of the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the student gets older, changes in the transition plan may be noted in the annual update of the student's individualized education program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A  transition plan required under this subsection (2) <strong>must be aligned with a student's high school and beyond plan</strong>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that data is available through data-sharing agreements established by the education data center under RCW 43.41.400, the education data center must monitor the following outcomes for individualized education program-eligible special education students after high school graduation:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The number of students who, within one year of high school graduation:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Enter integrated employment paid at the greater of minimum wage or competitive wage for the type of employment, with access to related employment and health benefits; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a postsecondary education or training program focused on leading to integrated employment;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wages and number of hours worked per pay period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of employment on any state and federal benefits for individuals with disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicators of the types of settings in which students who previously received transition services primarily reside;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicators of improved economic status and self-sufficiency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data on those students for whom a postsecondary or integrated employment outcome does not occur within one year of high school graduation, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Information on the reasons that the desired outcome has not occurred;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of months the student has not achieved the desired outcome; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The efforts made to ensure the student achieves the desired outcome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that the data elements in subsection (3) of this section are available to the education data center through data-sharing agreements, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must prepare an annual report using existing resources and submit the report to the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To minimize gaps in services through the transition process, no later than three years before students receiving special education services leave the school system, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall transmit a list of potentially eligible students to the department of social and health services, the counties, the department of services for the blind, and any other state agency working with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall ensure that consent be obtained prior to the release of this information as required in accordance with state and federal requirements.</strong></p>

<p>Beginning in the 2019-20 school year, school districts must document the language in which families of special education students prefer to communicate and whether a qualified interpreter for the student's family was provided at any planning meeting related to a student's individualized education program or plan developed under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and meetings related to school discipline and truancy.</p>
