<li>
<p>No person may distribute a bulk fertilizer in this state until a license to distribute has been obtained by that person. An annual license is required for each out-of-state or in-state location that distributes bulk fertilizer in Washington state. An application for each location must be filed on forms provided by the business licensing system established under chapter 19.02 RCW and must be accompanied by an annual fee of <strong>fifty</strong> dollars per location. The license expires on the business license expiration date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application for license must include the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The name and address of licensee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other information required by the department by rule.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name and address shown on the license must be shown on all labels, pertinent invoices, and storage facilities for fertilizer distributed by the licensee in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an application for license renewal provided for in this section is not filed prior to the business license expiration date, a delinquency fee of <strong>fifty</strong> dollars must be assessed and added to the original fee and must be paid by the applicant before the renewal license is issued. The assessment of this delinquency fee does not prevent the department from taking any other action as provided for in this chapter.</p>

The provisions of (g)(i) of this subsection do not apply if the anhydrous ammonia is derived in whole or in part from waste such that the fertilizer is a &quot;waste-derived fertilizer&quot; as defined in RCW 15.54.270. Verification of a registration relied on by an applicant under (g)(iii) of this subsection must be submitted with the application;</p>
</li>

Payment of a late fee does not prevent the department from taking any action authorized by this chapter for the violation.</p>
