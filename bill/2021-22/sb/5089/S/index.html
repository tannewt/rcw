<p>The legislature believes the diversity of the police force is essential to maintaining public trust and confidence in the criminal justice system. With this act, the legislature intends to provide for a diverse workforce with a variety of experiences and backgrounds that will ensure officers have the maturity and empathy to serve the citizens of Washington. The legislature is persuaded by research evidencing that adolescent brain development continues until a person reaches the age of 26. Law enforcement officers are entrusted with the tools and ability to effect life and liberty. We believe that increasing the qualification age of an officer to age 23 will help ensure the requisite maturity for these responsibilities.</p>
