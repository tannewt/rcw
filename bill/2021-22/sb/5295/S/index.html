<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that gas and electrical companies face transformational change brought on by new technology, rapidly changing costs, emerging opportunities for customers, and public policy mandates. Policy mandates, such as chapter 19.405 RCW, the clean energy transformation act, mean these companies must find innovative and creative solutions to equitably serve their customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the traditional regulatory construct is neither adaptable, nor well suited to adjusting to rapidly changing societal expectations and public policy objectives, and therefore hinders the ability of gas and electrical companies to effectively evolve to meet new challenges and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the regulatory construct should require a forward-looking orientation for regulation consistent with state policy objectives that focus on planning, flexibility, and fair allocation of risks, while fostering and supporting a culture that delivers performance and cost control in this new industry environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the regulation of gas and electrical companies transform toward multiyear rate plans and performance-based rate making to provide certainty and stability to customers and gas and electrical companies, with those plans focused on ensuring alignment of public policy objectives, investment, safety, and reliability.</p>

<p>Beginning January 1, 2022, every general rate case filing of a gas or electrical company must include a proposal for a multiyear rate plan as provided in this chapter. The commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or reject, a proposal for, an alternative proposal presented by parties in response to, a multiyear rate plan, or any combination thereof. The commission's consideration of a proposal for a multiyear rate plan is subject to the same standards applicable to other rate filings made under this title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gas or electrical company may propose and the commission may approve any proposal to recover from ratepayers up to five percent of the total approved revenue requirement approved by the commission for the initial rate year for tariffs that expand the affordability of services available to customers including, but not limited to: (a) Bill assistance programs for low-income residential customers; or (b) one or more special rates for low-income residential customers to reduce the energy burden of those customers.</p>

<li>
<p>In ascertaining and determining the fair value of property of a gas or electrical company pursuant to (b) of this subsection and projecting the operating expenses of a gas or electrical company pursuant to (c) of this subsection, the commission may use any standard, formula, method, or theory of valuation reasonably calculated to arrive at fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commission approves a multiyear rate plan with a duration of three or four years, then the gas or electrical company must update its power costs as of the rate effective date of the third rate year.

<li>
<p>The commission may, by order, establish terms, conditions, and procedures for a multiyear rate plan and ensure that rates remain just and reasonable during the course of the plan, including terms and procedures for rate adjustment during the term of the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gas or electrical company is bound by the terms of the multiyear rate plan approved by the commission for each of the initial rate year and the second rate year.

<p>A general rate case; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new multiyear rate plan in accordance with this section.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may, in approving a multiyear rate plan, determine a set of reasonable and applicable performance measures that can be used to assess a gas or electrical company operating under a multiyear rate plan. These performance measures may be proposed by the gas or electrical company in its initial application or by any other party to the proceeding in its response to the company's filing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes any gas or electrical company from making filings required or permitted by the commission.</p>
</li>

<p>A gas or electrical company may defer, without interest, any new costs, unknown at the time of the approval of any multiyear rate plan then in effect, that are associated with compliance of any governmental policy or plan not in existence as of the rate effective date and implemented during a multiyear rate plan. Recovery of these deferred costs must be addressed in the next applicable rate case or multiyear rate plan of the applicable gas or electrical company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall align, to the extent practical, the timing of approval of a multiyear rate plan of an electrical company submitted pursuant to this section with the clean energy implementation plan of the electrical company filed pursuant to RCW 19.405.060.</p>

<p>Upon request by an electrical or gas company, or other party to a general rate case hearing, the commission may approve rates, charges, services, and/or physical facilities at a discount for low-income senior customers and low-income customers. Expenses and lost revenues as a result of these discounts shall be included in the company's cost of service and recovered in rates to other customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An electrical company may provide discounts under this section to reduce the energy burden of low-income or vulnerable populations and to ensure that the benefits of the transition to clean energy are equitably distributed, as required under chapter 19.405 RCW.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Eligibility for the discount rates established in this section must be established upon verification of a low-income customer's receipt of any means tested public benefit, or verification of eligibility for the low-income home energy assistance program, or its successor program, for which eligibility does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level based on a household's gross income. The public benefits may include, but are not limited to, assistance that provides cash, housing, food, or medical care including, but not limited to, temporary assistance for needy families, supplemental security income, emergency assistance to elders, disabled, and children, supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, public housing, federally subsidized or state-subsidized housing, the low-income home energy assistance program, veterans' benefits, and similar benefits. Each gas or electrical company shall conduct substantial outreach efforts to make the low-income discount available to eligible customers and must provide annual reports to the commission as to the gas or electrical company's outreach activities and results. Outreach may include establishing an automated program of matching customer accounts with lists of recipients of the means tested public benefit programs and, based on the results of the matching program, to presumptively offer a low-income discount rate to eligible customers so identified. However, the gas or electrical company must within 60 days of the presumptive enrollment inform such a low-income customer of the presumptive enrollment and all rights and obligations of a customer under the program, including the right to withdraw from the program without penalty.</strong></p>
