<p>The legislature recognizes the need to increase the services available to the victims of sexual assault. The legislature also recognizes that these services are most effectively planned and provided at the local level through the combined efforts of concerned community and citizens groups, treatment providers, and local government officials. The legislature further recognizes that adequate services for victims is not only a matter of justice for the victim, but also a method by which additional abuse can be prevented.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to enhance the community-based services available to the victims of sexual assault by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Providing consolidated funding support for local programs which provide services to victims of sexual assault, as defined in RCW 70.125.030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing technical assistance and support to help communities plan for and provide victim services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing sexual assault services with a victim-focused mission, and consistent standards, policies, and granting and reporting requirements; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing communities and local victim service providers with opportunities to share information about successful prevention and treatment programs.</p>
</li>

<p>The Washington state sexual assault services advisory committee issued a report to the department of commerce and the department of social and health services in June of 1995. The committee made several recommendations to improve the delivery of services to victims of sexual assault: (1) Consolidate the administration and funding of sexual assault and abuse services in one agency instead of splitting those functions between the department of social and health services and the department of commerce; (2) adopt a funding allocation plan to pool all funds for sexual assault services and to distribute them across the state to ensure the delivery of core and specialized services; (3) establish service, data collection, and management standards and outcome measurements for recipients of grants; and (4) create a data collection system to gather pertinent data concerning the delivery of sexual assault services to victims.</p>
<p>The legislature approves the recommendations of the advisory committee and consolidates the functions and funding for sexual assault services in the department of commerce to implement the advisory committee's recommendations.</p>
