<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.60_tax_deferrals_for_investment_projects_in_rural_counties.html">82.60.010</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.60_tax_deferrals_for_investment_projects_in_rural_counties.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legislature finds that there are <strong>counties</strong> in the state that <strong>experience chronically high levels of unemployment and that state policies are necessary to promote economic stimulation and new employment opportunities in these counties</strong>. The legislature further finds that <strong>firms participating in a tax deferral program in high unemployment counties created more jobs and experienced higher levels of income growth than firms that did not participate in the deferral</strong>. For these reasons, the legislature reestablishes a tax deferral program to be effective solely in  counties <strong>experiencing high levels of unemployment</strong>. The legislature declares that this limited program serves the vital public purpose of creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty in  counties <strong>experiencing levels of unemployment that are higher than those</strong> of the state.</p>
