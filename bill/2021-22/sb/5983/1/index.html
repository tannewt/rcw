<p>Due to the evolving nature of new cannabinoids being identified in the plant Cannabis that may be impairing, the legislature finds there is a need to provide consumers legal access to products that have been tested and which meet the same standards for quality and safety as delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol. The legislature further finds there is a need to require labeling, serving size, potency, and ingredient disclosure standards for any impairing cannabinoid product. The legislature further finds there is a need to distinguish cannabinoids derived from natural plants that are prepared for human consumption and the more unpredictable artificial cannabinoids created solely through chemical reactions. The legislature further recognizes the need to maintain clarity between plants defined as marijuana and plants defined as hemp. The primary purpose of this act is to authorize the liquor and cannabis board to regulate all cannabinoids that may be impairing, regardless of origin, and to direct the board to adopt rules related to cannabinoid products and Cannabis isolates, except those authorized as a drug by the federal food and drug administration.</p>

<p>The licenses issuable under this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A wholesaler's license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A retailer's license.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application for the licenses must be made through the business licensing system under chapter 19.02 RCW. The board must adopt rules regarding the regulation of the licenses. The board may refrain from the issuance of any license under this chapter if the board has reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has willfully withheld information requested for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the applicant to receive a license, or if the board has reasonable cause to believe that information submitted in the application is false or misleading or is not made in good faith. In addition, for the purpose of reviewing an application for a wholesaler's license or retailer's license and for considering the denial, suspension, or revocation of any such license, the board may consider any prior criminal conduct of the applicant, including an administrative violation history record with the board and a criminal history record information check within the previous five years, in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions, and the provisions of RCW 9.95.240 and chapter 9.96A RCW do not apply to such cases.

<p>No person may qualify for a wholesaler's license or a retailer's license under this section without first undergoing a criminal background check. The background check must be performed by the board and must disclose any criminal conduct within the previous five years in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions. A person who possesses a valid license on July 22, 2001, is subject to this subsection and subsection (2) of this section beginning on the date of the person's business license expiration under chapter 19.02 RCW, and thereafter. If the applicant or licensee also has a license issued under chapter 66.24, 82.26, or 70.345 RCW, the background check done under the authority of chapter 66.24, 82.26, or 70.345 RCW satisfies the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each such license expires on the business license expiration date, and each such license must be continued annually if the licensee has paid the required fee**, plus any temporary license fee surcharge that may apply under section 13 of this act for retailers,** and complied with all the provisions of this chapter and the rules of the board made pursuant thereto.</p>
