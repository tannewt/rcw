The description shall be sufficiently broad to reflect the subject of the primary state services impacted, sufficiently precise to give notice of the specific subject matter of the state services impacted, and not exceed 10 words. If the fiscal impact falls primarily on the general fund, then the description of services may not exceed 15 words and shall list the top three categories of state services funded by the general fund in the current state budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attorney general shall be responsible for drafting the public services impact disclosure using neutral language that does not create prejudice for or against the measure. The attorney general's language is not subject to appeal. The public services impact disclosure shall appear on the ballot substantially as follows:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether subsection (1) of this section is met and in drafting the public services impact disclosure, the attorney general may rely on the filed fiscal impact statement and may consult with the office of financial management, the secretary of state, and any other state or local agencies as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon completion, the attorney general shall transmit the public services impact disclosure to the secretary of state.</p>
</li>
