<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that as the public enjoys open space and the natural beauty and recreational opportunities of this state, state lands and parks are a public good that should be available to all people, regardless of financial means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that while the economic circumstances resulting from the great recession brought about user-based, pay-to-play policies, such as the discover pass, for access to state-owned lands, this policy has resulted in decreased attendance and usage of our state parks and lands. A decline by an average of seven million visits per year as compared to the visitation rates of the two years prior to the enactment of the discover pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For most of Washington's history, public access to state parks and lands were free to all.  It was a policy that served our state well.  It is the intent of the legislature to return to that policy and repeal the requirement of having a discover pass to visit any state-owned land.  The lost revenues that would have otherwise come from discover pass sales are intended to be replaced with state general fund appropriation.</p>

<p>A subagent appointed by the director who no longer wants his or her appointment may recommend a successor who is the subagent's sibling, spouse, or child, or a subagency employee. The recommended successor must participate in the open competitive process used to select an applicant. In making successor recommendations and appointment determinations, the following provisions apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If a subagency is held by a partnership or corporate entity, the nomination must be submitted on behalf of, and agreed to by, all partners or corporate officers;</p>

<p>The appointment of a successor is intended to assist in the efficient transfer of appointments to minimize public inconvenience. The appointment of a successor does not create a proprietary or property interest in the appointment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A subagent appointee who is planning to retire within twelve months may recommend a successor without resigning his or her appointment by submitting a letter of intent to retire with a successor recommendation to the county auditor or other agent appointed by the director. The county auditor or other agent appointed by the director shall, within sixty days, respond in writing to the subagent appointee indicating if the recommended successor would be considered in the open competitive process. If there are negative factors or deficiencies pertaining to the subagency operation or the recommended successor, the county auditor or other agent appointed by the director must state these factors in writing to the subagent appointee. The subagent appointee may withdraw the letter of intent to retire any time prior to the start of the open competitive process by writing to the county auditor or other agent appointed by the director and filing a copy with the director;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A subagent appointee may name a recommended successor at any time during his or her appointment by notifying the county auditor or other agent appointed by the director in writing and filing a copy with the director. The purpose of this recommendation is for the county auditor or other agent appointed by the director to know the wishes of the subagent appointee in the event of the death or incapacitation of a sole subagent appointee or last remaining subagent appointee that could lead to the inability of the subagent to continue to fulfill the obligations of the appointment; and</p>
</li>

<p>If the county auditor or other agent appointed by the director does not select the recommended successor for appointment as a result of the open competitive process, the county auditor or other agent appointed by the director must contact the subagent appointee by letter and explain the decision.

Payment must be made on those requests found to be allowable from the licensing services account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>County revenues that exceed the cost of providing services described in the standard contract, calculated in accordance with the procedures in subsection (7) of this section, must be expended as determined by the county legislative authority during the process established by law for adoption of county budgets.</p>
