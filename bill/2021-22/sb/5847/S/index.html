<h2 id="section-1-980">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-980">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that our country faces a student loan debt crisis. Nationally, Americans owe $1.73 trillion in student loans. In Washington state, about 767,300 student loan borrowers owe nearly $27.4 billion of outstanding debt, more than $35,700 per borrower on average.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student loan debt is a multigenerational issue that affects borrowers of all ages and jeopardizes millions of families' long-term financial security. While student loan balances have risen for all age groups, older borrowers have seen the largest increase. Student loan defaults rise with the borrower's age, and parents and grandparents take on debt to help their children and grandchildren pay for their education. Borrowers are increasingly defaulting on their debts, resulting in income garnishment and deductions from federal tax refunds or social security payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that the federal government offers and provides loan forgiveness for individuals who have worked in a public service job full time and have made qualifying payments towards their student loans. Unfortunately, the eligibility criteria to qualify for this program has been complex, leading to low approval rates for individuals who would otherwise qualify. By providing more public awareness of this program, the legislature intends to help alleviate the student loan debt burden of those who have committed their lives to public service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to do the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Develop materials to increase awareness of the federal public service loan forgiveness program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a program for state agencies to certify employment for the purpose of the public service loan forgiveness program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have public service employers collaborate on a statewide initiative to improve access and remove barriers to the public service loan forgiveness program for all public service employees in the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acknowledge the work done outside the classroom by part-time academic employees, allowing for those hours to be counted towards the definition of full time for the public service loan forgiveness program as set forth in 34 C.F.R. Sec. 685.219.</p>
</li>
