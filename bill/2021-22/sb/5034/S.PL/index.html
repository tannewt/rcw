<p>The board may condition its submission of the plan of merger to the members on any basis.</p>

<p>If the plan of merger is required to be approved by the members, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, then the nonprofit corporation shall give notice to each member, whether or not entitled to vote on the merger, of the meeting of members at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing corporation or eligible entity, then the notice shall also include a copy or summary of the articles and bylaws or organic records of that corporation or eligible entity. If the corporation is to be merged into a corporation or eligible entity that is to be created pursuant to the merger, then the notice shall include a copy or a summary of the articles and bylaws or organic records of the new corporation or eligible entity. If a summary is provided in lieu of a copy of the plan or of the articles and bylaws, then a copy of the plan and articles and bylaws, as applicable, must be available to members upon request and this fact must be stated in the notice. Such copy of the plan and articles and bylaws, as applicable, may be made available in electronic format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the articles or bylaws, or the board acting pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of the plan of merger by the members entitled to vote thereon requires the approval of a majority of those members at a meeting at which a quorum is present, and, if any class of members is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger, the approval of a majority of the members of each voting group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group is present.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If as a result of a merger one or more members of a domestic nonprofit corporation would become subject to owner liability for the debts, obligations or liabilities of any other person or entity, then approval of the plan of merger requires the execution, by each member who would become subject to owner liability, of a separate record consenting to become subject to owner liability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a domestic nonprofit corporation that is a party to a merger does not have any members entitled to vote on the merger, then a plan of merger is deemed adopted by the corporation when it has been adopted by the board pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

<p>The superior courts of this state shall appoint as receiver of property located in this state a person who has been appointed by a federal or state court located elsewhere as receiver with respect to the property specifically or with respect to the owner's property generally, upon the application of the person or of any party to that foreign proceeding, and following the appointment shall give effect to orders, judgments, and decrees of the foreign court affecting the property in this state held by the receiver, unless the court determines that to do so would be manifestly unjust or inequitable. The venue of such a proceeding may be any county in which the person resides or maintains any office, or any county in which any property over which the receiver is to be appointed is located at the time the proceeding is commenced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least seven days' notice of any application for the appointment of a receiver must be given to the owner of property to be subject thereto and to all other parties in the action, and to other parties in interest as the court may require. If any execution by a judgment creditor under Title 6 RCW or any application by a judgment creditor for the appointment of a receiver, with respect to property over which the receiver's appointment is sought, is pending in any other action at the time the application is made, then notice of the application for the receiver's appointment also must be given to the judgment creditor in the other action. The court may shorten or expand the period for notice of an application for the appointment of a receiver upon good cause shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order appointing a receiver in all cases must reasonably describe the property over which the receiver is to take charge, by category, individual items, or both if the receiver is to take charge of less than all of the owner's property. If the order appointing a receiver does not expressly limit the receiver's authority to designated property or categories of property of the owner, the receiver is a general receiver with the authority to take charge over all of the owner's property, wherever located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may condition the appointment of a receiver upon the giving of security by the person seeking the receiver's appointment, in such amount as the court may specify, for the payment of costs and damages incurred or suffered by any person should it later be determined that the appointment of the receiver was wrongfully obtained.</p>

<p>(A) Food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller;</p>
<p>(B) Food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, including plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws. A plate does not include a container or packaging used to transport the food; or</p>
<p>(C) Two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, except:</p>
<p>(I) Food that is only cut, repackaged, or pasteurized by the seller; or</p>

<pre><code>    ii. Food is &quot;sold with eating utensils provided by the seller&quot; if:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The seller's customary practice for that item is to physically deliver or hand a utensil to the customer with the food or food ingredient as part of the sales transaction. If the food or food ingredient is prepackaged with a utensil, the seller is considered to have physically delivered a utensil to the customer unless the food and utensil are prepackaged together by a food manufacturer classified under sector 311 of the North American industry classification system (NAICS);</p>
<p>(B) A plate, glass, cup, or bowl is necessary to receive the food or food ingredient, and the seller makes those utensils available to its customers; or</p>
<p>(C)(I) The seller makes utensils available to its customers, and the seller has more than seventy-five percent prepared food sales. For purposes of this subsection (2)(c)(ii)(C), a seller has more than seventy-five percent prepared food sales if the seller's gross retail sales of prepared food under (c)(i)(A), (c)(i)(C), and (c)(ii)(B) of this subsection equal more than seventy-five percent of the seller's gross retail sales of all food and food ingredients, including prepared food, soft drinks, and dietary supplements.</p>

Whenever available, the number of servings included in a package of food or food ingredients must be determined based on the manufacturer's product label. If no label is available, the seller must reasonably determine the number of servings.</p>
<p>(III) The seller must determine a single prepared food sales percentage annually for all the seller's establishments in the state based on the prior year of sales. The seller may elect to determine its prepared food sales percentage based either on the prior calendar year or on the prior fiscal year. A seller may not change its elected method for determining its prepared food percentage without the written consent of the department. The seller must determine its annual prepared food sales percentage as soon as possible after accounting records are available, but in no event later than ninety days after the beginning of the seller's calendar or fiscal year. A seller may make a good faith estimate of its first annual prepared food sales percentage if the seller's records for the prior year are not sufficient to allow the seller to calculate the prepared food sales percentage. The seller must adjust its good faith estimate prospectively if its relative sales of prepared foods in the first ninety days of operation materially depart from the seller's estimate.</p>
<pre><code>    iii. &quot;Prepared food&quot; does not include the following items, if sold without eating utensils provided by the seller:
</code></pre>
