<p>Venue for a proceeding brought by the attorney general to dissolve a corporation pursuant to RCW 24.03.266 lies in the court specified in RCW 24.03.260. Venue for a proceeding brought by any other party named in RCW 24.03.266 lies in the county where a corporation's principal office (or, if none in this state, its registered office) is or was last located.</p>

<li>
<p>It is not necessary to make directors or members parties to a proceeding to dissolve a nonprofit corporation unless relief is sought against them individually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court in a proceeding brought to dissolve a nonprofit corporation may issue injunctions, appoint a general or custodial receiver with all powers and duties the court directs, take other action required to preserve the corporate assets wherever located, and carry on the activities of the corporation until a full hearing can be held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a nonprofit corporation may appoint one or more general receivers to wind up and liquidate, or one or more custodial receivers to manage, the affairs of the corporation. The court shall hold a hearing, after giving notice to all parties to the proceeding and any interested persons designated by the court, before appointing a general or custodial receiver. The court appointing a general or custodial receiver has exclusive jurisdiction over the corporation and all of its property wherever located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may require the general or custodial receiver to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall describe the powers and duties of the general or custodial receiver in its appointing order, which may be amended from time to time. Among other powers:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The general receiver:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>May dispose of all or any part of the assets of the nonprofit corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May sue and defend in his or her own name as general receiver of the corporation in all courts of this state;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The custodial receiver may exercise all of the powers of the corporation, through or in place of its board of directors, to the extent necessary to manage the affairs of the corporation consistent with its mission and in the best interests of the corporation, and its creditors.</p>

<li>
<p>During a general receivership, the court may redesignate the general receiver a custodial receiver, and during a custodial receivership may redesignate the custodial receiver a general receiver, if doing so is consistent with the mission of the nonprofit corporation and in the best interests of the corporation and its creditors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court from time to time during the general or custodial receivership may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or reimbursements made to the general or custodial receiver and counsel from the assets of the nonprofit corporation or proceeds from the sale of the assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assets of the corporation or the proceeds resulting from the sale, conveyance, or other disposition thereof shall be applied and distributed as follows:</p>

<li>
<p>Assets held by the corporation upon condition requiring return, transfer, or conveyance, which condition occurs by reason of the dissolution or liquidation, shall be returned, transferred, or conveyed in accordance with such requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assets received and held by the corporation subject to limitations permitting their use only for charitable, religious, eleemosynary, benevolent, educational, or similar purposes, but not held upon a condition requiring return, transfer, or conveyance by reason of the dissolution or liquidation, shall be transferred or conveyed to one or more domestic or foreign corporations, societies, or organizations engaged in activities substantially similar to those of the dissolving or liquidating corporation as the court may direct;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other assets, if any, shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws to the extent that the articles of incorporation or bylaws determine the distributive rights of members, or any class or classes of members, or provide for distribution to others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any remaining assets may be distributed to such persons, societies, organizations, or domestic or foreign corporations, whether for profit or not for profit, specified in the plan of distribution adopted as provided in this chapter, or where no plan of distribution has been adopted, as the court may direct.</p>
