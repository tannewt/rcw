<h2 id="section-1-1247">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1247">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that it has previously found that every three minutes an American child or adult is diagnosed with a potentially fatal blood disease. For many of these individuals, bone marrow transplantation is the only chance for survival. The legislature finds that 70 percent of patients do not have a fully matched donor in their family and rely on a registry to find an unrelated donor. The legislature further finds that 40 to 71 percent of individuals with diverse heritage never find a bone marrow match. The ultimate key to survivability lies in increasing the number of bone marrow donors across all ethnicities, which will increase the potential for a suitable match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to continue to increase awareness of bone marrow donation by encouraging school districts, charter schools, and state-tribal compact schools to offer instruction on this topic to high school students in at least one health class necessary for graduation. The legislature also intends for this instruction to be optional for elementary and middle school students.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-977">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-977">¶</a></h2>
