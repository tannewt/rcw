<p>No licensee may make a loan using any method of calculating interest other than the simple interest method; except that the add-on method of calculating interest may be used for a loan not secured by real property or personal property used as a residence when the repayment period does not exceed three years and fifteen days after the loan origination date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No licensee may make a loan using the add-on method to calculate interest that does not provide for a refund to the borrower or a credit to the borrower's account of any unearned interest when the loan is repaid before the original maturity date in full by cash, by a new loan, by refinancing, or otherwise before the final due date. The refund must be calculated using the actuarial method, unless a sum equal to two or more installments has been prepaid and the account is not in arrears and continues to be paid ahead, in which case the interest on the account must be recalculated by the simple interest method with the refund of unearned interest made as if the loan had been made using the simple interest method. When computing an actuarial refund, the lender may round the annual rate used to the nearest quarter of one percent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In computing a required refund of unearned interest, a prepayment made on or before the fifteenth day after the scheduled payment date is deemed to have been made on the payment date preceding the prepayment. In the case of prepayment before the first installment due date, the company may retain an amount not to exceed one-thirtieth of the first month's interest charge for each day between the origination date of the loan and the actual date of prepayment.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>No licensee may provide credit life or disability insurance in an amount greater than that required to pay off the total balance owing on the date of the borrower's death net of refunds in the case of credit life insurance, or all minimum payments that become due on the loan during the covered period of disability in the case of credit disability insurance. The lender may not require any such insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except in the case of loans by mail, where the borrower has sufficient time to review papers before returning them, no licensee may prepare loan papers in advance of the loan closing without having reviewed with the borrower the terms and conditions of the loan to include the type and amount of insurance, if any, requested by the borrower.</p>

<ol type="a">

The initial term of the letter of credit must be at least two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financial institution that provides the letter of credit as required in (a) of this subsection may not be affiliated with the licensee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee with a rating of either 4A1 or 5A1 from Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit services for three consecutive years is exempt from the requirements set forth in (a) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licensee shall maintain a minimum capital of ten million dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee may rely on the capital of its parent to satisfy the requirement of subsection (2) of this section. However, for any year in which a licensee seeks to so rely, it shall provide to the director a certified financial statement of the parent showing a net worth of at least one hundred million dollars as of the close of its most recent fiscal year and a binding written commitment from the parent to the licensee to make a minimum of ten million dollars available to the licensee as a capital contribution in connection with its reverse mortgage lending program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not apply to a licensee that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Only originates proprietary reverse mortgage loans the proceeds of which are fully disbursed at the loan closing; or</p>

<li>
<p>Only originates proprietary reverse mortgage loans that are sold into the secondary market to an investor with either a 4A1 or 5A1 rating from Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit services.

<p>The department of financial institutions has specific authority to develop rules regarding the interpretation and implementation of this section. A proprietary reverse mortgage loan must comply with all of the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section prepayment, in whole or in part, or the refinancing of a reverse mortgage loan, is permitted without penalty at any time during the term of the reverse mortgage loan. For the purposes of this section, penalty does not include any fees, payments, or other charges, not including interest, that would have otherwise been due upon the reverse mortgage being due and payable. However, when a reverse mortgage lender has paid or waived all of the usual fees or costs associated with a reverse mortgage loan, a prepayment penalty may be imposed, provided the penalty does not exceed the total amount of the usual fees or costs that were initially absorbed or waived by the reverse mortgage lender. A mortgagee may not impose a prepayment penalty under this subsection if the prepayment is caused by the occurrence of the death of the borrowers. A borrower must be provided prior written notice of any permissible prepayment penalty under this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reverse mortgage loan may provide for a fixed or adjustable interest rate or combination thereof, including compound interest, and may also provide for interest that is contingent on the value of the property upon execution of the loan or at maturity, or on changes in value between closing and maturity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lender shall pay a late charge to the borrower for any late advance. If the lender does not mail or electronically transfer a scheduled monthly advance to the borrower on the first business day of the month, or within five business days of the date the lender receives the request, or such other regularly scheduled contractual date, the late charge is ten percent of the entire amount that should have been paid to the borrower for that month or as a result of that request. For each additional day that the lender fails to make the advance, the lender shall pay interest on the late advance at the interest rate stated in the loan documents. If the loan documents provide for an adjustable interest rate, the rate in effect when the late charge first accrues is used. Any late charge is paid from the lender's funds and may not be added to the unpaid principal balance. Additionally, the lender forfeits the right to interest and a monthly servicing fee for any months in which the advance has not been timely made. This section does not affect the department of financial institution's ability to impose other sanctions to protect consumers of reverse mortgage loans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reverse mortgage loan may become due and payable upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The home securing the loan is sold or title to the home is otherwise transferred;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All borrowers cease occupying the home as a principal residence, except as provided in subsection (5) of this section; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A defaulting event occurs which is specified in the loan documents;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repayment of the reverse mortgage loan is subject to the following additional conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Temporary absences from the home not exceeding one hundred eighty consecutive days do not cause the mortgage to become due and payable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended absences from the home exceeding one hundred eighty consecutive days, but less than one year, do not cause the mortgage to become due and payable if the borrower has taken prior action that secures and protects the home in a manner satisfactory to the lender, as specified in the loan documents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lender's right to collect reverse mortgage loan proceeds is subject to the applicable statute of limitations for written loan contracts. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the statute of limitations shall commence on the date that the reverse mortgage loan becomes due and payable as provided in the loan agreement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using conspicuous, bold sixteen-point or larger type, the lender shall disclose in the loan agreement any interest rate or other fees to be charged during the period that commences on the date that the reverse mortgage loan becomes due and payable, and that ends when repayment in full is made;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first page of any deed of trust securing a reverse mortgage loan must contain the following statement in sixteen-point boldface type: &quot;This deed of trust secures a reverse mortgage loan;&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lender or any other party that participates in the origination of a reverse mortgage loan shall not require an applicant for a reverse mortgage to purchase an annuity, insurance, or another product as a condition of obtaining a reverse mortgage loan. A reverse mortgage lender or a broker arranging a reverse mortgage loan shall not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Offer an annuity to the borrower prior to the closing of the reverse mortgage or before the expiration of the right of the borrower to rescind the reverse mortgage agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer the borrower to anyone for the purchase of an annuity prior to the closing of the reverse mortgage or before the expiration of the right of the borrower to rescind the reverse mortgage agreement; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide marketing information or annuity sales leads to anyone regarding the prospective borrower or borrower, or receive any compensation for such an annuity sale or referral;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A lender or any other party that participates in the origination of a reverse mortgage loan shall maintain safeguards, acceptable to the department of financial institutions, to ensure that individuals offering reverse mortgage loans do not provide reverse mortgage borrowers with any other financial or insurance products and that individuals participating in the origination of a reverse mortgage loan have no ability or incentive to provide the borrower with any other financial or insurance product;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The borrower shall not be required, directly or indirectly, as a condition of obtaining a reverse mortgage under this section, to purchase any other financial or insurance products;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to accepting a final and complete application for a reverse mortgage loan or assessing any fees, a lender shall refer the prospective borrower to an independent housing counseling agency approved by the federal department of housing and urban development for counseling. The counseling must meet the standards and requirements established by the federal department of housing and urban development for reverse mortgage counseling. The lender shall provide the borrower with a list of at least five independent housing counseling agencies approved by the federal department of housing and urban development, including at least two agencies that can provide counseling by telephone. Telephone counseling is only available at the borrower's request;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lender shall not accept a final and complete application for a reverse mortgage loan from a prospective applicant or assess any fees upon a prospective applicant without first receiving a certification from the applicant or the applicant's authorized representative that the applicant has received counseling from an agency as described in subsection (9) of this section. The certification must be signed by the borrower and the agency counselor, and must include the date of the counseling and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of both the counselor and the borrower. Electronic facsimile copy of the housing counseling certification satisfies the requirements of this subsection. The lender shall maintain the certification in an accurate, reproducible, and accessible format for the term of the reverse mortgage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reverse mortgage loan may not be made for a Washington state resident unless that resident is a minimum of sixty years of age as of the date of execution of the loan; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for the initial disbursement of moneys to the closing agent, advances by the lender to the borrower must be issued directly to the borrower, or his or her legal representative, and not to an intermediary or third party.</p>

<li>A proprietary reverse mortgage loan application may not be taken by a lender unless the loan applicant has received from the lender the following plain language statement in conspicuous bold sixteen-point type or larger, advising the prospective borrower about counseling prior to obtaining the reverse mortgage loan within three business days of receipt of the completed loan application:</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;Important notice to reverse mortgage loan applicant</p>
<p>A reverse mortgage is a complex financial transaction that provides a means of using the equity you have built up in your home, or the value of your home, as a way to access home equity.</p>
<p>If you decide to obtain a reverse mortgage loan, you will sign binding legal documents that will have important legal, tax, and financial implications for you and your estate.</p>
<p>It is very important for you to understand the terms of the reverse mortgage and its effect. Before entering into this transaction, you are required by law to consult with an independent loan counselor. A list of approved counselors will be provided to you by the lender or broker. You may also want to discuss your decision with family members or others on whom you rely for financial advice.&quot;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>As part of the disclosure required under this section, the lender or servicer shall provide an annual, or more frequent, disclosure statement to the borrower, providing details of the loan advances, balance, other terms, and the name and telephone number of the lender's employee or agent who has been specifically designated to respond to inquiries concerning reverse mortgage loans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to any other loan documentation or disclosure, prior to execution of the loan and at the end of the loan term, the lender may either obtain an independent appraisal of the property value or use the current year's tax assessment valuation of the property. Copies of these appraisals must be timely provided to the borrower within five days of the borrower's written request, provided the borrower has paid for the appraisal.</p>
