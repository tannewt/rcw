<h2 id="section-1-614">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-614">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<pre><code>a. Increasing broadband access to unserved areas of the state provides a public benefit to the citizens of Washington by allowing full participation in society and the modern economy, and enabling access to health care, education, and essential services, including public safety;

b. Achieving affordable and quality broadband access for all Washingtonians will require sustained investment, research, local and community participation, and partnerships between private, public, and nonprofit entities;

c. Providing for additional coordination across sectors to increase broadband access in unserved areas is in the best interest of the state; and

d. Expanding broadband access, especially broadband conduit along roadways, provides commensurate benefits to the transportation system and motor vehicle users in terms of reducing congestion by allowing for more telework, and laying the foundation for a transportation system increasingly more reliant on autonomous vehicles.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Therefore, the legislature intends to expand broadband access to unserved areas throughout the state by increasing broadband infrastructure coordination opportunities, including a registry for broadband infrastructure projects, allowing installation of infrastructure during state road construction projects, and further mapping of broadband deployment locations.</li>

<p><strong>If a service provider responds to the department's notice within 30 days, the department may schedule a consultation meeting with the service provider to review installation opportunities.</strong></p>

Consistent with federal highway administration approval, the lease must include the right of direct ingress and egress from the highway for construction and maintenance of the personal wireless service facility <strong>or broadband conduit</strong> during nonpeak hours if public safety is not adversely affected. Direct ingress and egress may be allowed at any time for the construction of the facility <strong>or conduit</strong> if public safety is not adversely affected and if construction will not substantially interfere with traffic flow during peak traffic periods. The lease may specify an indirect ingress and egress to the facility <strong>or conduit</strong> if it is reasonable and available for the particular location.</p>
