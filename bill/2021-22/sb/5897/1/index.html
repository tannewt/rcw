<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Gasoline and diesel are essential to daily life for most Washington residents, with gasoline and diesel helping to take most working people to and from their jobs, take most students to and from school, and keep Washington's economy moving, helping transport freight to and from markets and ports and transport food from farm to table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That while the state budget is expected to have a record surplus, Washingtonians are facing a 40-year record high of inflation in the cost of goods and services, and their own household budgets have been affected by a 42 percent increase in the cost of gasoline since the beginning of 2021. It also finds that the cost of gasoline and diesel consumes more financial resources from lower-income households, which can least afford significant price inflation, and from rural households, which incur larger costs for essential travel than residents of more populated regions of the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to make gasoline and diesel more affordable for the families, job creators, students, and residents of Washington by suspending the motor vehicle fuel tax, using a portion of the historic budget surplus, and offering this significant, direct tax relief through December 31, 2022.</p>
</li>
</ol>
