[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5750.PL.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. The Washington state leadership board has been a nonprofit organization with significant, vested interest in the improvement of Washington state through their service and dedication to marginalized students and their ability to bestow honors on behalf of the state.

2. There has been a lack of substantive extracurricular activities for historically marginalized students in Washington state to be involved in, and the Washington state leadership board has created equitable and accessible programs for marginalized students to succeed. The Washington state leadership board bridges the gap between student accessibility and student achievement by utilizing public and private funds to create three unique programs for marginalized students: The Washington world fellows program, boundless Washington program, and compassion scholars program.

3. The Washington world fellows program is a global leadership development program that provides students who may lack access with training that enhances high school academics, supports their trajectory into college, and establishes strong leadership traits. The program includes college preparation through research, mentoring, and preparation for college entrance exams, including the opportunity for students to participate in a global leadership exchange experience.

4. The boundless Washington program provides an opportunity for students with physical and sensory disabilities to develop leadership skills through the outdoors. Students with physical and sensory disabilities explore the outdoors through immersive excursions that students learn about through online curriculum and practice through outdoor activities with peers.

5. The compassion scholars program creates life-changing compassion scholars' excursions, with a delegation that includes students, elected officials, and community leaders, that focus on highlighting for high school students the positive work of public servants that have dedicated themselves to improving their community.

6. The Washington state leadership board has bestowed honors like the Washingtonian of the year and the organization of the year on behalf of the state for over 45 years.
