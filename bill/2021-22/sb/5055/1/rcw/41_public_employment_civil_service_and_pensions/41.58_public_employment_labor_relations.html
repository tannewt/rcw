<p>There is hereby created the public employment relations commission (hereafter called the &quot;commission&quot;) to administer the provisions of this chapter. The commission shall consist of three members who shall be citizens appointed by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate. One of the original members shall be appointed for a term of three years, one for a term of four years, and one for a term of five years. Their successors shall be appointed for terms of five years each, except that any person chosen to fill a vacancy shall be appointed only for the unexpired term of the member whom he or she succeeds. Commission members shall be eligible for reappointment. The governor shall designate one member to serve as chair of the commission. Any member of the commission may be removed by the governor, upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause. Commission members shall not be eligible for state retirement under chapter 41.40 RCW by virtue of their service on the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In making citizen member appointments initially, and subsequently thereafter, the governor shall be cognizant of the desirability of appointing persons knowledgeable in the area of labor relations in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vacancy in the commission shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the commission, and two members of the commission shall, at all times, constitute a quorum of the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall at the close of each fiscal year make a report in writing to the legislature and to the governor stating the cases it has heard, the decisions it has rendered, the names, salaries, and duties of all employees and officers in the employ or under the supervision of the commission, and an account of all moneys it has disbursed.</p>

<li>
<p>The commission shall appoint an executive director whose annual salary shall be determined under the provisions of RCW 43.03.028. The executive director shall perform such duties and have such powers as the commission shall prescribe in order to implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. In addition to the performance of administrative duties, the commission may delegate to the executive director authority with respect to, but not limited to, representation proceedings, unfair labor practice proceedings, mediation of labor disputes, arbitration of disputes concerning the interpretation or application of a collective bargaining agreement, and, in certain cases, fact-finding or arbitration of disputes concerning the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. Such delegation shall not eliminate a party's right of appeal to the commission. The executive director, with such assistance as may be provided by the attorney general and such additional legal assistance consistent with chapter 43.10 RCW, shall have authority on behalf of the commission, when necessary to carry out or enforce any action or decision of the commission, to petition any court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring compliance with the action or decision.</p>

<p>It shall be the duty of the commission, in order to prevent or minimize interruptions growing out of labor disputes, to assist employers and employees to settle such disputes through mediation and fact-finding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission, through the director, may proffer its services in any labor dispute arising under a collective bargaining statute administered by the commission, either upon its own motion or upon the request of one or more of the parties to the dispute, whenever in its judgment such dispute threatens to cause a substantial disruption to the public welfare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the director is not able to bring the parties to agreement by mediation within a reasonable time, the director shall seek to induce the parties to voluntarily seek other means of settling the dispute without resort to strike or other coercion, including submission to the employees in the bargaining unit of the employer's last offer of settlement for approval or rejection in a secret ballot. The failure or refusal of either party to agree to any procedure suggested by the director shall not be deemed a violation of any duty or obligation imposed by this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing collective bargaining agreement. The commission is directed to make its mediation and fact-finding services available in the settlement of such grievance disputes only as a last resort.</p>
