# Senate Bill 5498 - as passed by the Legislature

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5498.PL.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature affirms its statutory assertion that the purpose of a high school diploma is to declare that a student is ready for success in postsecondary education, gainful employment, and citizenship, and is equipped with the skills to be a lifelong learner.

2. The legislature finds that, on rare occasions and due to unforeseen circumstances, school districts may wish to provide recognition of a student's status of being on-track to graduate, which is interrupted by an untimely passing that prevents the completion of the secondary education program. In these limited instances, school districts should have discretion to issue a posthumous high school diploma with an "honoris causa" inscription.

3. The legislature recognizes that the authority to issue a high school diploma properly rests with the local school district and its determination of whether a student has met the applicable state and local graduation requirements. The legislature finds, however, that establishing uniform requirements governing the issuance of posthumous diplomas by school districts will promote the proper and effective administration of the public education system.

4. The legislature, therefore, intends to authorize school districts to issue posthumous high school diplomas for qualifying students and in accordance with delineated requirements that promote local discretion, consistent administration, and the acknowledgment of academic achievements that were prematurely interrupted by the student's untimely passing.
