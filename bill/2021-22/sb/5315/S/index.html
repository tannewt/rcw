<h2 id="section-1-3061">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3061">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that creating a framework for Washington private entities and public institutions of higher education to manage their risks through captive insurers will facilitate the growth and safety of those entities and protect the public interest. The legislature further finds that captive insurance promotes prudent risk management and provides access to insurance and reinsurance markets that may not be available to these Washington entities otherwise. The legislature believes that encouraging the use of captive insurance will support those who rely upon the strength and stability of employers in this state.</p>
<p>The legislature does not intend by this act to make Washington a captive domicile state. Rather, the legislature is establishing a framework for registration by captive insurers that insure Washington-based entities and are licensed by the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>On or before the first day of March of each year, a registered eligible captive insurer must remit to the state treasurer through the commissioner a tax in the amount of two percent of the premiums, exclusive of returned premiums and sums collected to cover federal and state taxes and examination fees, for insurance directly procured by and provided to its parent or another affiliate for Washington risks during the preceding calendar year. The tax when collected must be credited to the general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;Washington risks&quot; means the share of risk covered by the premiums that is allocable to this state, based on where the underlying risks are located or where the losses or injuries giving rise to covered claims arise. A registered eligible captive insurer may use any reasonable method of determining such an allocation, including actuarial analysis or use of a proxy such as sales, property value, or payroll. Whether paid directly or by reimbursement, neither the timing nor the nature of a captive insurer's payment may be deemed to reflect, create, or constitute Washington risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registered eligible captive insurer must share its methodology and relevant analysis in determining its allocation with the commissioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A registered eligible captive insurer is not liable for premium tax on moneys received as a reinsurer or on insurance placed through a surplus lines broker or other intermediary that collects and remits premium tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a registered eligible captive insurer fails to remit the tax provided by this section by the last day of the month in which the tax becomes due, the registered eligible captive insurer must pay the tax and the penalties and interest provided in RCW 48.14.060. The tax may be collected by distraint, or the tax and fine may be recovered by an action instituted by the commissioner in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any fine collected by the commissioner must be paid to the state treasurer and credited to the general fund.</p>

<li>
<p>Taxes on premiums are due under this section from an eligible captive insurer for any period after January 1, 2011, if not previously remitted to the commissioner, and further provided that all such taxes must be limited to an eligible captive insurer's Washington risks. Taxes due under this subsection for periods before July 1, 2021, are not subject to the penalties or interest provided in RCW 48.14.060. For periods beginning July 1, 2021, a registered eligible captive insurer is subject to the sanctions in subsection (5) of this section.</p>

With regard to any investigation, administrative proceedings, or litigation, the commissioner can rely on the procedural law and regulations of the state.

<li>
<p>Subject to other provisions of this chapter, each authorized insurer except title insurers <strong>and registered eligible captive insurers as defined in section 2 of this act</strong> shall on or before the first day of March of each year pay to the state treasurer through the commissioner's office a tax on premiums. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, such tax shall be in the amount of two percent of all premiums, excluding amounts returned to or the amount of reductions in premiums allowed to holders of industrial life policies for payment of premiums directly to an office of the insurer, collected or received by the insurer under RCW 48.14.090 during the preceding calendar year other than ocean marine and foreign trade insurances, after deducting premiums paid to policyholders as returned premiums, upon risks or property resident, situated, or to be performed in this state. For tax purposes, the reporting of premiums shall be on a written basis or on a paid-for basis consistent with the basis required by the annual statement. For the purposes of this section the consideration received by an insurer for the granting of an annuity shall not be deemed to be a premium.</p>

<p>In the case of insurers which require the payment by their policyholders at the inception of their policies of the entire premium thereon in the form of premiums or premium deposits which are the same in amount, based on the character of the risks, regardless of the length of term for which such policies are written, such tax shall be in the amount of two percent of the gross amount of such premiums and premium deposits upon policies on risks resident, located, or to be performed in this state, in force as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding, less the unused or unabsorbed portion of such premiums and premium deposits computed at the average rate thereof actually paid or credited to policyholders or applied in part payment of any renewal premiums or premium deposits on one-year policies expiring during such year.</p>

<li>
<p>Each authorized insurer shall with respect to all ocean marine and foreign trade insurance contracts written within this state during the preceding calendar year, on or before the first day of March of each year pay to the state treasurer through the commissioner's office a tax of ninety-five one-hundredths of one percent on its gross underwriting profit. Such gross underwriting profit shall be ascertained by deducting from the net premiums (i.e., gross premiums less all return premiums and premiums for reinsurance) on such ocean marine and foreign trade insurance contracts the net losses paid (i.e., gross losses paid less salvage and recoveries on reinsurance ceded) during such calendar year under such contracts. In the case of insurers issuing participating contracts, such gross underwriting profit shall not include, for computation of the tax prescribed by this subsection, the amounts refunded, or paid as participation dividends, by such insurers to the holders of such contracts.</p>

<li>
<p>The state does hereby preempt the field of imposing excise or privilege taxes upon insurers or their appointed insurance producers, other than title insurers, and no county, city, town or other municipal subdivision shall have the right to impose any such taxes upon such insurers or these insurance producers.</p>
