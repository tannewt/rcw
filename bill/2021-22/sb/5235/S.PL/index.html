<p>The legislature finds that local zoning laws can contribute to limiting the housing available for Washingtonians. The legislature finds that reducing these barriers can increase affordable housing options. The legislature finds that accessory dwelling units can be one way to add affordable long-term housing and to provide a needed increase in housing density. However, the legislature finds that research from several cities shows that when accessory dwelling units are built and offered for short-term rental for tourists and business visitors, they may not improve housing affordability. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to encourage reducing barriers to accessory dwelling units when local governments have programs to incentivize or assure that they will be utilized for long-term housing. The legislature finds that owner occupancy requirements may provide an appropriate means for local governments to ensure community impacts of accessory dwelling units are mitigated and allow for relaxation of other requirements, when they are an element of a program to reduce short-term rental of accessory dwelling units. The legislature also intends to remove barriers and restrictions on the number of unrelated occupants permitted to live together, which will provide additional affordable housing options.</p>
