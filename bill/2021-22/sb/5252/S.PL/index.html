<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.300_superintendent_of_public_instruction.html">28A.300</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.300_superintendent_of_public_instruction.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that federal law requires some school districts to consult with federally recognized tribes on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students. Under the federal every student succeeds act, this consultation requirement is intended to &quot;ensure timely and meaningful consultation on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students.&quot; The legislature acknowledges that many school district staff have not had the opportunity to learn how to engage in meaningful consultation as required by the federal law and recognizes that additional training opportunities for school directors and school district staff are needed. The legislature finds that ensuring the federal consultation requirements are implemented in a meaningful way will contribute towards helping create a more inclusive educational environment that supports long-term success for all native students.</p>
