<p>The legislature finds and declares the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As the number of environmental laws and development regulations has increased for land uses and development, so has the number of required local land use permits, each with its own separate approval process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increasing number of local and state land use permits and separate environmental review processes required by agencies has generated continuing potential for conflict, overlap, and duplication between the various permit and review processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This regulatory burden has significantly added to the cost and time needed to obtain local and state land use permits and has made it difficult for the public to know how and when to provide timely comments on land use proposals that require multiple permits and have separate environmental review processes.</p>
</li>

<p>Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Closed record appeal&quot; means an administrative appeal on the record to a local government body or officer, including the legislative body, following an open record hearing on a project permit application when the appeal is on the record with no or limited new evidence or information allowed to be submitted and only appeal argument allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Local government&quot; means a county, city, or town.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Open record hearing&quot; means a hearing, conducted by a single hearing body or officer authorized by the local government to conduct such hearings, that creates the local government's record through testimony and submission of evidence and information, under procedures prescribed by the local government by ordinance or resolution. An open record hearing may be held prior to a local government's decision on a project permit to be known as an &quot;open record predecision hearing.&quot; An open record hearing may be held on an appeal, to be known as an &quot;open record appeal hearing,&quot; if no open record predecision hearing has been held on the project permit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Project permit&quot; or &quot;project permit application&quot; means any land use or environmental permit or license required from a local government for a project action, including but not limited to building permits, subdivisions, binding site plans, planned unit developments, conditional uses, shoreline substantial development permits, site plan review, permits or approvals required by critical area ordinances, site-specific rezones authorized by a comprehensive plan or subarea plan, but excluding the adoption or amendment of a comprehensive plan, subarea plan, or development regulations except as otherwise specifically included in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Public meeting&quot; means an informal meeting, hearing, workshop, or other public gathering of people to obtain comments from the public or other agencies on a proposed project permit prior to the local government's decision. A public meeting may include, but is not limited to, a design review or architectural control board meeting, a special review district or community council meeting, or a scoping meeting on a draft environmental impact statement. A public meeting does not include an open record hearing. The proceedings at a public meeting may be recorded and a report or recommendation may be included in the local government's project permit application file.</p>

<li>
<p>Fundamental land use planning choices made in adopted comprehensive plans and development regulations shall serve as the foundation for project review. The review of a proposed project's consistency with applicable development regulations, or in the absence of applicable regulations the adopted comprehensive plan, under RCW 36.70B.040 shall incorporate the determinations under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During project review, a local government or any subsequent reviewing body shall determine whether the items listed in this subsection are defined in the development regulations applicable to the proposed project or, in the absence of applicable regulations the adopted comprehensive plan. At a minimum, such applicable regulations or plans shall be determinative of the:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Type of land use permitted at the site, including uses that may be allowed under certain circumstances, such as planned unit developments and conditional and special uses, if the criteria for their approval have been satisfied;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Density of residential development in urban growth areas; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability and adequacy of public facilities identified in the comprehensive plan, if the plan or development regulations provide for funding of these facilities as required by chapter 36.70A RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>During project review, the local government or any subsequent reviewing body shall not reexamine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in subsection (2) of this section, except for issues of code interpretation. As part of its project review process, a local government shall provide a procedure for obtaining a code interpretation as provided in RCW 36.70B.110.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to RCW 43.21C.240, a local government may determine that the requirements for environmental analysis and mitigation measures in development regulations and other applicable laws provide adequate mitigation for some or all of the project's specific adverse environmental impacts to which the requirements apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section limits the authority of a permitting agency to approve, condition, or deny a project as provided in its development regulations adopted under chapter 36.70A RCW and in its policies adopted under RCW 43.21C.060. Project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of development, such as the details of site plans, curb cuts, drainage swales, transportation demand management, the payment of impact fees, or other measures to mitigate a proposal's probable adverse environmental impacts, if applicable.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The level of development, such as units per acre or other measures of density;</p>

<li>
<p>Not later than April 1, 1996, a local government planning under RCW 36.70A.040 shall provide a notice of application to the public and the departments and agencies with jurisdiction as provided in this section. If a local government has made a threshold determination ((of significance)) under chapter 43.21C RCW concurrently with the notice of application, the notice of application ((shall)) may be combined with the threshold determination ((of significance)) and the scoping notice for a determination of significance. Nothing in this section prevents a determination of significance and scoping notice from being issued prior to the notice of application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice of application shall be provided within fourteen days after the determination of completeness as provided in RCW 36.70B.070 and include the following in whatever sequence or format the local government deems appropriate:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The date of application, the date of the notice of completion for the application, and the date of the notice of application;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of the proposed project action and a list of the project permits included in the application and, if applicable, a list of any studies requested under RCW 36.70B.070 or * 36.70B.090;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The identification of other permits not included in the application to the extent known by the local government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The identification of existing environmental documents that evaluate the proposed project, and, if not otherwise stated on the document providing the notice of application, such as a city land use bulletin, the location where the application and any studies can be reviewed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement of the public comment period, which shall be not less than fourteen nor more than thirty days following the date of notice of application, and statements of the right of any person to comment on the application, receive notice of and participate in any hearings, request a copy of the decision once made, and any appeal rights. A local government may accept public comments at any time prior to the closing of the record of an open record predecision hearing, if any, or, if no open record predecision hearing is provided, prior to the decision on the project permit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date, time, place, and type of hearing, if applicable and scheduled at the date of notice of the application;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement of the preliminary determination, if one has been made at the time of notice, of those development regulations that will be used for project mitigation and of consistency as provided in RCW 36.70B.040; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other information determined appropriate by the local government.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an open record predecision hearing is required for the requested project permits, the notice of application shall be provided at least fifteen days prior to the open record hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government shall use reasonable methods to give the notice of application to the public and agencies with jurisdiction and may use its existing notice procedures. A local government may use different types of notice for different categories of project permits or types of project actions. If a local government by resolution or ordinance does not specify its method of public notice, the local government shall use the methods provided for in (a) and (b) of this subsection. Examples of reasonable methods to inform the public are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Posting the property for site-specific proposals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publishing notice, including at least the project location, description, type of permit(s) required, comment period dates, and location where the complete application may be reviewed, in the newspaper of general circulation in the general area where the proposal is located or in a local land use newsletter published by the local government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notifying public or private groups with known interest in a certain proposal or in the type of proposal being considered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notifying the news media;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Placing notices in appropriate regional or neighborhood newspapers or trade journals;</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>A notice of application shall not be required for project permits that are categorically exempt under chapter 43.21C RCW, unless a public comment period or an open record predecision hearing is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government shall integrate the permit procedures in this section with environmental review under chapter 43.21C RCW as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except for a threshold determination ((of significance)), the local government may not issue ((its threshold determination, or issue)) a decision or a recommendation on a project permit until the expiration of the public comment period on the notice of application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an open record predecision hearing is required and the local government's threshold determination requires public notice under chapter 43.21C RCW, the local government shall issue its threshold determination at least fifteen days prior to the open record predecision hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comments shall be as specific as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government may combine any hearing on a project permit with any hearing that may be held by another local, state, regional, federal, or other agency provided that the hearing is held within the geographic boundary of the local government. Hearings shall be combined if requested by an applicant, as long as the joint hearing can be held within the time periods specified in *RCW 36.70B.090 or the applicant agrees to the schedule in the event that additional time is needed in order to combine the hearings. All agencies of the state of Washington, including municipal corporations and counties participating in a combined hearing, are hereby authorized to issue joint hearing notices and develop a joint format, select a mutually acceptable hearing body or officer, and take such other actions as may be necessary to hold joint hearings consistent with each of their respective statutory obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All state and local agencies shall cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the local government in holding a joint hearing if requested to do so, as long as:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The agency is not expressly prohibited by statute from doing so;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sufficient notice of the hearing is given to meet each of the agencies' adopted notice requirements as set forth in statute, ordinance, or rule; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agency has received the necessary information about the proposed project from the applicant to hold its hearing at the same time as the local government hearing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government is not required to provide for administrative appeals. If provided, an administrative appeal of the project decision, combined with any environmental determinations, shall be filed within fourteen days after the notice of the decision or after other notice that the decision has been made and is appealable. The local government shall extend the appeal period for an additional seven days, if state or local rules adopted pursuant to chapter 43.21C RCW allow public comment on a determination of nonsignificance issued as part of the appealable project permit decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant for a project permit is deemed to be a participant in any comment period, open record hearing, or closed record appeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each local government planning under RCW 36.70A.040 shall adopt procedures for administrative interpretation of its development regulations.</p>

If an applicant elects the consolidated permit review process, the determination of completeness, notice of application, and notice of final decision must include all project permits being reviewed through the consolidated permit review process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consolidated permit review may provide different procedures for different categories of project permits, but if a project action requires project permits from more than one category, the local government shall provide for consolidated permit review with a single open record hearing and no more than one closed record appeal as provided in RCW 36.70B.060. Each local government shall determine which project permits are subject to an open record hearing and a closed record appeal. Examples of categories of project permits include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Proposals that are categorically exempt from chapter 43.21C RCW, such as construction permits, that do not require environmental review or public notice;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permits that require environmental review, but no open record predecision hearing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permits that require a threshold determination and an open record predecision hearing and may provide for a closed record appeal to a hearing body or officer or to the local government legislative body.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A local government may provide by ordinance or resolution for the same or a different decision maker or hearing body or officer for different categories of project permits. In the case of consolidated project permit review, the local government shall specify which decision makers shall make the decision or recommendation, conduct the hearing, or decide the appeal to ensure that consolidated permit review occurs as provided in this section. The consolidated permit review may combine an open record predecision hearing on one or more permits with an open record appeal hearing on other permits. In such cases, the local government by ordinance or resolution shall specify which project permits, if any, shall be subject to a closed record appeal.</p>
