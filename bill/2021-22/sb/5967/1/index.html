<h2 id="section-1-655">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-655">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The Paris agreement is a binding international treaty on climate change, which was adopted by 196 parties, including the United States in Paris, in 2015;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Paris agreement is a landmark agreement that establishes a framework for bringing all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In recent years, the state of Washington has taken equally ambitious efforts to meet science-based net zero targets by 2050 under RCW 70A.45.020. In order to meet these obligations, the state has adopted a range of decarbonization bills including: Cap and invest, clean fuel standard, eliminating fossil fuels from electricity supply by 2045, building efficiency standards, hydrofluorocarbon elimination, electrification of transportation, and more;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of these policies requires economic and social transformation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To achieve economic and social transformation, it is essential that every private and governmental institution, and the citizenry served by these institutions, contribute to this effort;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding these global, national, and state-level efforts to address climate change, the world's largest commercial and investment banks have been largely omitted from these efforts and, to a certain extent, impeded these efforts in recent years through fossil fuel industry financing practices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, banks play a disproportionate and comprehensive role in climate change by financing fossil fuel projects worldwide that are directly and scientifically shown to be the primary cause of climate change. Between 2016 and 2021, data shows that the 60 largest commercial and investment banks through their lending and underwriting practices invested a total of $3,800,000,000,000 into fossil fuels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite this track record by the financial industry of continuing to pour financing into companies that directly engage in oil and gas extraction, petroleum refining, coal mining, and other fossil fuel industries, a coalition of the world's biggest investors, banks and insurers at the 2021 climate change conference made a pledge, referred to as the Glasgow financial alliance for net zero, to align their lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050. According to a press release by the Glasgow financial alliance for net zero, participating financial institutions &quot;have committed to high ambition, science-based targets, including achieving net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, delivering their fair share of 50 percent emission reductions this decade, and reviewing their targets towards this every five years&quot;; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, the office of financial management prepared a report indicating that, in the 2019-2021 biennium, the state spent approximately $1,400,000,000 on programs, projects, and activities that contribute to climate resiliency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore it is the legislature's intent to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Require financial institutions to directly, demonstrably, and transparently contribute at the state level to Washington's climate resiliency and mitigation commitment efforts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide additional funding for climate resiliency efforts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage financial institutions to expeditiously cease financial practices that create a negative externality and impede efforts to address climate change; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve these objectives by establishing a surcharge on financial institutions that continue to significantly finance the fossil fuel industry.</p>

<p>From January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2049, a climate resiliency and mitigation surcharge is imposed on specified financial institutions that are bankers of fossil fuels.

</li>
</ol>
<p>(I) It is the type of lease permitted to be made by national banks (see 12 U.S.C. Sec. 24(7) and (10), comptroller of the currency regulations, part 23, leasing (added by 56 C.F.R. Sec. 28314, June 20, 1991, effective July 22, 1991), and regulation Y of the federal reserve system 12 C.F.R. Part 225.25, as amended); and</p>
<p>(II) It is the economic equivalent of an extension of credit, i.e., the lease is treated by the lessor as a loan for federal income tax purposes. In no event does a lease qualify as an extension of credit where the lessor takes depreciation on such property for federal income tax purposes.</p>
<p>(B) For this classification to apply, the average of the gross income in the current tax year and immediately preceding two tax years must satisfy the more than fifty percent requirement;</p>
<pre><code>x. Any other person or business entity, other than an insurance general agent taxable under RCW 82.04.280(1)(e), an insurance business exempt from the business and occupation tax under RCW 82.04.320, a real estate broker taxable under RCW 82.04.255, a securities dealer or international investment management company taxable under RCW 82.04.290(2), that receives more than fifty percent of its gross receipts from activities that a person described in (d)(ii) through (vii) and (ix) of this subsection is authorized to transact.

e. [Empty]

    i. &quot;Specified financial institution&quot; means a financial institution that is a member of a consolidated financial institution group that reported on its consolidated financial statement for the previous calendar year annual net income of at least one billion dollars, not including net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as the terms &quot;net income&quot; and &quot;noncontrolling interest&quot; are used in the consolidated financial statement.

    ii. If financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements, &quot;specified financial institution&quot; means any person that was subject to the additional tax in this section in at least two of the previous four calendar years.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The department must notify the fiscal committees of the legislature if financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To aid in the effective administration of the additional tax imposed in this section, the department may require a person believed to be a specified financial institution to disclose whether it is a member of a consolidated financial institution group and, if so, to identify all other members of its consolidated financial institution group. A person failing to comply with this subsection is deemed to have intended to evade tax payable under this section and is subject to the penalty in RCW 82.32.090(7) on any tax due under this section by the person and any financial institution affiliated with the person.</p>
