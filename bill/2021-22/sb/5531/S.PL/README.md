    b. Send the notice to the apparent owner's email address if the administrator does not have a valid United States mail address for an apparent owner, but has an email address that the administrator does not know to be invalid.

3. In addition to the notice under subsection (2) of this section, the administrator shall:

2. Made payment or delivery:

    a. In response to a demand by the administrator or administrator's agent; or

    b. Under a guidance or ruling issued by the administrator which the holder reasonably believed required or permitted the property to be paid or delivered.

    a. Except as otherwise provided in this section, on filing a report under section 401 of this act, the holder shall pay or deliver to the administrator the property described in the report.

        ii. The administrator determines that relief from the electronic payment requirement under this subsection supports the efficient or effective administration of this chapter.

2. If property in a report under section 401 of this act is an automatically renewable deposit and a penalty or forfeiture in the payment of interest would result from paying the deposit to the administrator at the time of the report, the date for payment of the property to the administrator is extended until a penalty or forfeiture no longer would result from payment, if the holder informs the administrator of the extended date.

3. Tangible property in a safe deposit box may not be delivered to the administrator until 180 days after filing the report under section 401 of this act.

8. A holder is not required to deliver to the administrator a security identified by the holder as a nonfreely transferable security. If the administrator or holder determines that a security is no longer a nonfreely transferable security, the holder shall deliver the security on the next regular date prescribed for delivery of securities under this chapter. The holder shall make a determination annually whether a security identified in a report filed under section 401 of this act as a nonfreely transferable security is no longer a nonfreely transferable security.


## Section 604
1. On payment or delivery of property to the administrator under this chapter, the administrator as agent for the state assumes custody and responsibility for safekeeping the property.

2. This state shall defend and indemnify a holder against liability on a claim against the holder resulting from the payment or delivery of property to the administrator made in good faith and after the holder substantially complied with sections 501 and 502 of this act.

The holder may claim reimbursement even if the payment was made to a person whose claim was made after expiration of a period of limitation on the owner's right to receive or recover property, whether specified by contract, statute, or court order.

4. A holder that under this chapter delivers property other than money to the administrator may file a claim for return of the property from the administrator if:

## Section 607
If property other than money is delivered to the administrator, the owner is entitled to receive from the administrator income or gain realized or accrued on the property before the property is sold. If the property was an interest-bearing demand, savings, or time deposit, the administrator shall pay interest at the rate the property earned while in possession of the holder.

2. An action or proceeding may not be commenced against the state, an agency of the state, the administrator, another officer, employee, or agent of the state, or a holder for or because of an act of the administrator under this section, except for intentional misconduct or malfeasance.


## Section 610
1. Expiration, before, on, or after the effective date of this section, of a period of limitation on an owner's right to receive or recover property, whether specified by contract, statute, or court order, does not prevent the property from being presumed abandoned or affect the duty of a holder under this chapter to file a report or pay or deliver property to the administrator.

2. The administrator may not commence an action or proceeding to enforce this chapter with respect to the reporting, payment, or delivery of property more than six years after the holder filed a nonfraudulent report under section 401 of this act with the administrator.

2. Securities listed on an established stock exchange must be sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale on the exchange. Other securities may be sold over the counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by any other method the administrator considers advisable.

5. If the administrator fails to act within the period prescribed in subsection (2)(a) or (g) of this section, the failure does not affect a right of the administrator, except that interest does not accrue on the amount for which the putative holder was determined to be liable under section 1012 of this act during the period in which the administrator failed to act until the earlier of:

    a. The date under section 1103 of this act the putative holder initiates administrative review or files an action under section 1104 of this act; or

    b. Both parties are entitled to subpoena the attendance of witnesses as in other civil actions and to produce evidence that is competent, relevant, and material to determine the correct amount due, if any, that should be paid by the plaintiff.
