<p>A sea cucumber dive fishery license is required to take sea cucumbers for commercial purposes. A sea cucumber dive fishery license authorizes the use of only one diver in the water at any time during sea cucumber harvest operations. If the same vessel has been designated on two sea cucumber dive fishery licenses, two divers may be in the water. A natural person may not hold more than two sea cucumber dive fishery licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the director shall issue no new sea cucumber dive fishery licenses. For licenses issued for the year 2000 and thereafter, the director shall renew existing licenses only to a natural person who held the license at the end of the previous year. If a sea cucumber dive fishery license is not held by a natural person as of December 31, 1999, it is not renewable. However, if the license is not held because of revocation or suspension of licensing privileges, the director shall renew the license in the name of a natural person at the end of the revocation or suspension if the license holder applies for renewal of the license before the end of the year in which the revocation or suspension ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a licensee failed to obtain the license during either of the previous two years because of a license suspension by the director or the court, the licensee may qualify for a license by establishing that the person held such a license during the last year in which the person was eligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sea cucumber dive fishery licenses are transferable subject to the fees and restrictions in RCW 77.65.020(2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If fewer than twenty persons are eligible for sea cucumber dive fishery licenses, the director may accept applications for new licenses. The additional licenses may not cause more than twenty natural persons to be eligible for a sea cucumber dive fishery license. New licenses issued under this section shall be distributed according to rules of the department that recover the value of such licensed privilege.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the wise management of Washington state's herring resource is of paramount importance to the people of the state. The legislature finds that herring are an important part of the food chain for a number of the state's living marine resources. The legislature finds that both open and closed pond &quot;spawn on kelp&quot; harvesting techniques allow for an economic return to the state while at the same time providing for the proper management of the herring resource. The legislature finds that limitations on the number of herring harvesters tends to improve the management and economic health of the herring industry. The maximum number of herring spawn on kelp fishery licenses shall not exceed five annually. The state therefore must use its authority to regulate the number of herring spawn on kelp fishery licenses so that the management and economic health of the herring fishery may be improved.</p>

<p>A person shall not harvest geoduck clams commercially without a geoduck fishery license. This section does not apply to the harvest of private sector cultured aquatic products as defined in RCW 15.85.020. The geoduck fishery license fee and the application fee are specified in RCW 77.65.220.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a person who has entered into a geoduck harvesting agreement with the department of natural resources under RCW 79.135.210 may hold a geoduck fishery license.</p>

In making those determinations, the director shall seek to conserve the geoduck resource and prevent damage to its habitat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The holder of a geoduck fishery license and the holder's agents and representatives shall comply with all applicable commercial diving safety regulations adopted by the federal occupational safety and health administration established under the federal occupational safety and health act of 1970 as such law exists on May 8, 1979, 84 Stat. 1590 et seq.; 29 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq. A violation of those regulations is a violation of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, persons who dive for geoducks are &quot;employees&quot; as defined by the federal occupational safety and health act. A violation of this subsection is grounds for suspension or revocation of a geoduck fishery license following a hearing under the procedures of chapter 34.05 RCW. The director shall not suspend or revoke a geoduck fishery license if the violation has been corrected within ten days of the date the license holder receives written notice of the violation. If there is a substantial probability that a violation of the commercial diving standards could result in death or serious physical harm to a person engaged in harvesting geoduck clams, the director shall suspend the license immediately until the violation has been corrected.

<li>
<p>No more than two shrimp pot-Puget Sound fishery licenses may be owned by a licensee. The licensee must transfer the second license into the licensee's name, and designate on the second license the same vessel as is designated on the first license at the time of the transfer. Licensees who hold two shrimp pot-Puget Sound fishery licenses may not transfer one of the two licenses for a twelve-month period beginning on the date the second license is transferred to the licensee, but the licensee may transfer both licenses to another natural person. The nontransferability provisions of this subsection start anew for the receiver of the two licenses. Licensees who hold two shrimp pot-Puget sound fishery licenses may fish one and one-half times the maximum number of pots allowed for Puget Sound shrimp, and may retain and land one and one-half times the maximum catch limits established for Puget Sound shrimp taken with shellfish pot gear.</p>

A licensee with a bona fide medical emergency may designate a person other than an immediate family member as the alternate operator for a period not to exceed two years, provided the licensee documents the medical emergency with letters from two medical doctors describing the illness or condition that prevents the licensee from participating in the fishery. The two-year period may be extended by the director upon recommendation of a department-appointed Puget Sound shrimp advisory board. If the licensee has no immediate family member who is capable of operating the license, the licensee may make a request to the Puget Sound shrimp advisory board to designate an alternate operator who is not an immediate family member, and upon recommendation of the Puget Sound shrimp advisory board, the director may allow designation of an alternate operator who is not an immediate family member.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>May only be issued to a natural person who held a coastal spot shrimp experimental emerging commercial fishery license and coastal spot shrimp fishery permit in 2010 or had the license transferred to him or her, under RCW 77.65.020 and 77.65.040, by a person who held a coastal spot shrimp experimental emerging commercial fishery license and coastal spot shrimp fishery permit in 2010;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must be renewed annually by December 31st of the calendar year to remain active; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the restrictions of subsection (7) of this section and to RCW 77.65.020 and 77.65.040, is transferable to a natural person beginning January 1, 2012.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a person fails to obtain a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license during the previous year because of a license suspension, the person may qualify for a license by establishing that the person held such a license during the last year in which the license was not suspended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The annual fee for a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license is as specified in RCW 77.65.220.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in 2013, after taking into consideration the status of the coastal spot shrimp population, the market for spot shrimp, and the number of active fishers, both nontreaty and treaty, the director may issue a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license to a natural person if the issuance would not raise the number of active spot shrimp pot fishery licenses to more than eight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning 2012, a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license holder is prohibited from designating, on the Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A vessel whose surveyed length overall is more than ten feet longer than the surveyed length overall of the vessel designated on the licensee's coastal spot shrimp experimental emerging commercial fishery license as of March 31, 2003; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vessel whose surveyed length overall exceeds ninety feet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event the Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license is transferred by sale, lease, inheritance, or lottery, and pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the vessel length restriction associated with that license must remain attached to the license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A natural person may not own or hold an ownership interest in more than one Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a person who owns or is designated as an operator of the vessel designated on the license may hold a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Requires the <strong>department</strong> to open a commercial coastal spot shrimp fishery in any given year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibits the <strong>department</strong> from closing or limiting an opened commercial coastal spot shrimp fishery for any reason; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confers any right of compensation to the holder of a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license if the license is revoked, limited, or modified by the legislature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issuance of a Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery license does not create, and may not be construed to create, any right, title, or interest in the coastal spot shrimp resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington-coastal spot shrimp pot fishery licenses may be revoked by future legislatures if the fishery is found to have jeopardized the sustainability of the coastal spot shrimp resource or the marine ecosystem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
