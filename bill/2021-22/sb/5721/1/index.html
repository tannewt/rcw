<p>The legislature finds that management of Washington state's natural resources requires clear, efficient, and coordinated management that is accountable to the public. Therefore, the legislature finds that consolidating management of natural resources under the commissioner of public lands by having the commissioner appoint the directors of the department of fish and wildlife and the state parks and recreation commission would create an efficient decision-making structure and provide for public accountability. The legislature further finds that having the commissioner of public lands appoint the members of the fish and wildlife advisory commission and the state parks and recreation advisory committee and having the commission and committee serve in an advisory role to the directors of the relevant agencies would maintain strong public input into natural resource management issues while establishing a centralized and accountable structure for securing, managing, and enhancing the state's natural resources.</p>

<p>The fish and wildlife enforcement reward account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. Deposits to the account include: Receipts from fish and shellfish overages as a result of a department enforcement action; fees for hunter education deferral applications; fees for master hunter applications and master hunter certification renewals; all receipts from criminal wildlife penalty assessments under this chapter; all receipts of court-ordered restitution or donations associated with any fish, shellfish, or wildlife enforcement action; and proceeds from forfeitures and evidence pursuant to RCW 77.15.070 and 77.15.100. The department may accept money or personal property from persons under conditions requiring the property or money to be used consistent with the intent of expenditures from the fish and wildlife enforcement reward account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for investigation and prosecution of fish and wildlife offenses, to provide rewards to persons informing the department about violations of this title and rules adopted under this title, to offset department-approved costs incurred to administer the hunter education deferral program and the master hunter permit program, and for other valid enforcement uses as determined by the <strong>department</strong>. Only the director or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>

<p>In order to effectively manage wildlife in areas or at times when a higher proficiency and demonstrated skill level are needed for resource protection or public safety, the department establishes the master hunter permit program. The master hunter permit program emphasizes safe, ethical, responsible, and lawful hunting practices. Program goals include improving the public's perception of hunting and perpetuating the highest hunting standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A master hunter permit is required to participate in controlled hunts to eliminate problem animals that damage property or threaten public safety. The <strong>department</strong> may establish by rule the requirements an applicant must comply with when applying for or renewing a master hunter permit, including but not limited to a criminal background check. The director may establish an advisory group to assist the department with administering the master hunter <strong>permit</strong> program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fee for an initial master hunter permit may not exceed fifty dollars, and the cost of renewing a master hunter permit may not exceed twenty-five dollars. Funds generated under this section must be deposited into the fish and wildlife enforcement reward account established in RCW 77.15.425, and the funds must be used exclusively to administer the master hunter <strong>permit</strong> program.</p>

<p>Whenever the commission finds that any land under its control cannot advantageously be used for park purposes, it is authorized to dispose of such land by the method provided in this section or by the method provided in RCW 79A.05.170. If such lands are school or other grant lands, control thereof shall be relinquished by resolution of the commission to the proper state officials. If such lands were acquired under restrictive conveyances by which the state may hold them only so long as they are used for park purposes, they may be returned to the donor or grantors by the commission. All other such lands may be either sold by the commission to the highest bidder or exchanged for other lands of equal value by the commission, and all conveyance documents shall be executed by the governor. All such exchanges shall be accompanied by a transfer fee, to be set by the commission and paid by the other party to the transfer; such fee shall be paid into the parkland acquisition account established under RCW 79A.05.170. The commission may accept sealed bids, electronic bids, or oral bids at auction. Bids on all sales shall be solicited at least twenty days in advance of the sale date by an advertisement appearing at least once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the land to be sold is located. If the commission feels that no bid received adequately reflects the fair value of the land to be sold, it may reject all bids, and may call for new bids. All proceeds derived from the sale of such park property shall be paid into the parkland acquisition account. All land considered for exchange shall be evaluated by the commission to determine its adaptability to park usage. The equal value of all lands exchanged shall first be determined by the appraisals to the satisfaction of the commission.</p>
