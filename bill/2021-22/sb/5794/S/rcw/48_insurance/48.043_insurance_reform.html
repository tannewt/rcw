<li>
<p>Each carrier offering or renewing a health benefit plan on or after January 1, 2016, must offer member transparency tools with certain price and quality information to enable the member to make treatment decisions based on cost, quality, and patient experience. The transparency tools must aim for best practices and, at a minimum:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Must display cost data for common treatments within the following categories:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Inpatient treatments;</p>

<li>
<p>Recognizing integrated health care delivery systems focus on total cost of care, carrier's operating integrated care delivery systems may meet the requirement of (a) of this subsection by providing meaningful consumer data based on the total cost of care. This subsection applies only to the portion of enrollment a carrier offers pursuant to chapter 48.46 RCW and as part of an integrated delivery system, and does not exempt from (a) of this subsection coverage offered pursuant to chapter 48.21, 48.44, or 48.46 RCW if not part of an integrated delivery system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are encouraged to display the cost for prescription medications on their member website or through a link to a third party that manages the prescription benefits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must include a patient review option or method for members to provide a rating or feedback on their experience with the medical provider that allows other members to see the patient review, the feedback must be monitored for appropriateness and validity, and the site may include independently compiled quality of care ratings of providers and facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must allow members to access the estimated cost of the treatment, or the total cost of care, as set forth in (a) and (b) of this subsection on a portable electronic device;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must display options based on the selected search criteria for members to compare;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must display the estimated cost of the treatment, or total cost of the care episode, and the estimated out-of-pocket costs of the treatment for the member and display the application of personalized benefits such as deductibles and cost-sharing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must display quality information on providers when available; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are encouraged to display alternatives that are more cost-effective when there are alternatives available, such as the use of an ambulatory surgical center when one is available or medical versus surgical alternatives as appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the required features on cost and quality information, the member transparency tools must include information to allow a provider and hospital search of in-network providers and hospitals with provider information including specialists, distance from patient, the provider's contact information, the provider's education, board certification and other credentials, where to find information on malpractice history and disciplinary actions, affiliated hospitals and other providers in a clinic, and directions to provider offices and hospitals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each carrier offering or renewing a health benefit plan on or after January 1, 2016, must provide enrollees with the performance information required by section 2717 of the patient protection and affordable care act, P.L. 111-148 (2010), as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act, P.L. 111-152 (2010), and any federal regulations or guidance issued under that section of the affordable care act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each carrier offering or renewing a health benefit plan on or after January 1, 2016, must, within thirty days from the offer or renewal date, attest to the office of the insurance commissioner that the member transparency tools meet the requirements in this section and access to the tools is available on the home page within the health plan's secured member website.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;second-party payment process&quot; means a process in which: (a) An individual has an account under his or her name maintained with a financial institution and is either managed by the financial institution or an entity that, with the express agreement with the individual, has established the account on behalf of the individual with a financial institution; (b) the account is funded with funds from the individual or his or her family members or in a manner otherwise consistent with federal law including, but not limited to, federal guidance implementing the federal patient protection and affordable care act; and (c) the account is under the control of the covered person, such that the covered person may authorize payments from the account.</p>

<li>
<p>All issuers must accept any payments made by a second-party payment process; however, no issuer need accept payment by a second-party payment process if the second-party payer is controlled by or receives funding from any entity where such entity may be reimbursed by an issuer for providing health care services or if the account under the control of the covered person is funded by any such entity, except those third-party entities from whom federal law requires such issuer to accept payment.</p>

<p>The legislature intends to codify the state's current practice of requiring health carriers to bill enrollees with a single invoice and to segregate into a separate account the premium attributable to abortion services for which federal funding is prohibited.

Further, section 1303 states that the act does not preempt or otherwise have any effect on state laws regarding the prohibition of, or requirement of, coverage, funding, or procedural requirements on abortions.</p>

<p>Digital breast tomosynthesis, also called three-dimensional mammography, is the latest advancement in breast imaging. Studies indicate that digital breast tomosynthesis can result in a forty-one percent increase in invasive cancer detection, a fifteen percent decrease in the recall rate from screening mammography, and a twenty-nine percent increase in the detection of all breast cancers. In addition, the American college of radiology has indicated that tomosynthesis is no longer investigational. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure women have access to the most effective breast imaging and to clarify that the existing mandate for mammography must include tomosynthesis.</p>

<li>
<p>When conducting a review of the necessity and appropriateness of emergency services or making a benefit determination for emergency services:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A health carrier shall cover emergency services necessary to screen and stabilize a covered person if a prudent layperson acting reasonably would have believed that an emergency medical condition existed. In addition, a health carrier shall not require prior authorization of emergency services provided prior to the point of stabilization if a prudent layperson acting reasonably would have believed that an emergency medical condition existed. With respect to care obtained from an out-of-network hospital emergency department, a health carrier shall cover emergency services necessary to screen and stabilize a covered person. In addition, a health carrier shall not require prior authorization of the services provided prior to the point of stabilization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an authorized representative of a health carrier authorizes coverage of emergency services, the health carrier shall not subsequently retract its authorization after the emergency services have been provided, or reduce payment for an item or service furnished in reliance on approval, unless the approval was based on a material misrepresentation about the covered person's health condition made by the provider of emergency services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coverage of emergency services may be subject to applicable in-network copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles, as provided in chapter 48.49 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a health carrier requires preauthorization for postevaluation or poststabilization services, the health carrier shall provide access to an authorized representative twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to facilitate review. In order for postevaluation or poststabilization services to be covered by the health carrier, the provider or facility must make a documented good faith effort to contact the covered person's health carrier within thirty minutes of stabilization, if the covered person needs to be stabilized. The health carrier's authorized representative is required to respond to a telephone request for preauthorization from a provider or facility within thirty minutes. Failure of the health carrier to respond within thirty minutes constitutes authorization for the provision of immediately required medically necessary postevaluation and poststabilization services, unless the health carrier documents that it made a good faith effort but was unable to reach the provider or facility within thirty minutes after receiving the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A health carrier shall immediately arrange for an alternative plan of treatment for the covered person if an out-of-network emergency provider and health carrier cannot reach an agreement on which services are necessary beyond those immediately necessary to stabilize the covered person consistent with state and federal laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section is to be construed as prohibiting the health carrier from requiring notification within the time frame specified in the contract for inpatient admission or as soon thereafter as medically possible but no less than twenty-four hours. Nothing in this section is to be construed as preventing the health carrier from reserving the right to require transfer of a hospitalized covered person upon stabilization. Follow-up care that is a direct result of the emergency must be obtained in accordance with the health plan's usual terms and conditions of coverage. All other terms and conditions of coverage may be applied to emergency services.</p>

<li>
<p>The risk with respect to the carrier's assets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk of adverse insurance experience with respect to the carrier's liabilities and obligations;</p>

<li>
<p>The interest rate risk with respect to the carrier's business; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An excess of capital over the amount produced by the risk-based capital requirements contained in RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370 and the formulas, schedules, and instructions referenced in RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370 is desirable in the business of insurance. Accordingly, carriers should seek to maintain capital above the RBC levels required by RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370. Additional capital is used and useful in the insurance business and helps to secure a carrier against various risks inherent in, or affecting, the business of insurance and not accounted for or only partially measured by the risk-based capital requirements contained in RCW 48.43.300 through 48.43.370.</p>

However, if any materially false statement with respect to the comparison regarding a carrier's total adjusted capital to its RBC levels (or any of them) or an inappropriate comparison of any other amount to the carrier's RBC levels is published in any written publication and the carrier is able to demonstrate to the commissioner with substantial proof the falsity of such statement, or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then the carrier may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false statement.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>When coverage of a prescription drug for the treatment of any medical condition is subject to prescription drug utilization management, the patient and prescribing practitioner must have access to a clear, readily accessible, and convenient process to request an exception through which the prescription drug utilization management can be overridden in favor of coverage of a prescription drug prescribed by a treating health care provider. A health carrier or prescription drug utilization management entity may use its existing medical exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process must be easily accessible on the health carrier and prescription drug utilization management entity's website. Approval criteria must be clearly posted on the health carrier and prescription drug utilization management entity's website. This information must be in plain language and understandable to providers and patients.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The required prescription drug is contraindicated or will likely cause a clinically predictable adverse reaction by the patient;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The patient is currently experiencing a positive therapeutic outcome on a prescription drug recommended by the patient's provider for the medical condition under consideration while on his or her current or immediately preceding health plan, and changing to the required prescription drug may cause clinically predictable adverse reactions, or physical or mental harm to, the patient; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The required prescription drug is not in the best interest of the patient, based on documentation of medical appropriateness, because the patient's use of the prescription drug is expected to:</p>

<p>Health carriers must cover an emergency supply fill if a treating health care provider determines an emergency fill is necessary to keep the patient stable while the exception request is being processed. This exception shall not be used to solely justify any further exemption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When responding to a prescription drug utilization management exception request, a health carrier or prescription drug utilization management entity shall clearly state in their response if the exception request was approved or denied. The health carrier must use clinical review criteria as referenced in RCW 48.43.410 for the basis of any denial. Any denial must be based upon and include the specific clinical review criteria relied upon for the denial and include information regarding how to appeal denial of the exception request. If the exception request from a treating health care provider is denied for administrative reasons, or for not including all the necessary information, the health carrier or prescription drug utilization management entity must inform the provider what additional information is needed and the deadline for its submission.</p>

<li>
<p>The health carrier or prescription drug utilization management entity must permit a stabilized patient to remain on a drug during an exception request process.</p>

<p>There is a need for a process for the fair consideration of disputes relating to decisions by carriers that offer a health plan to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate coverage of or payment for health care services for an enrollee. For purposes of this section, &quot;carrier&quot; also applies to a health plan if the health plan administers the appeal process directly or through a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An enrollee may seek review by a certified independent review organization of a carrier's decision to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate coverage of or payment for a health care service, after exhausting the carrier's grievance process and receiving a decision that is unfavorable to the enrollee, or after the carrier has exceeded the timelines for grievances provided in RCW 48.43.530, without good cause and without reaching a decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commissioner must establish and use a rotational registry system for the assignment of a certified independent review organization to each dispute. The system should be flexible enough to ensure that an independent review organization has the expertise necessary to review the particular medical condition or service at issue in the dispute, and that any approved independent review organization does not have a conflict of interest that will influence its independence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carriers must provide to the appropriate certified independent review organization, not later than the third business day after the date the carrier receives a request for review, a copy of:</p>

<p>Any medical records of the enrollee that are relevant to the review;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A list of each physician or health care provider who has provided care to the enrollee and who may have medical records relevant to the appeal. Health information or other confidential or proprietary information in the custody of a carrier may be provided to an independent review organization, subject to rules adopted by the commissioner.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrollees must be provided with at least five business days to submit to the independent review organization in writing additional information that the independent review organization must consider when conducting the external review. The independent review organization must forward any additional information submitted by an enrollee to the plan or carrier within one business day of receipt by the independent review organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The medical reviewers from a certified independent review organization will make determinations regarding the medical necessity or appropriateness of, and the application of health plan coverage provisions to, health care services for an enrollee. The medical reviewers' determinations must be based upon their expert medical judgment, after consideration of relevant medical, scientific, and cost-effectiveness evidence, and medical standards of practice in the state of Washington. Except as provided in this subsection, the certified independent review organization must ensure that determinations are consistent with the scope of covered benefits as outlined in the medical coverage agreement. Medical reviewers may override the health plan's medical necessity or appropriateness standards if the standards are determined upon review to be unreasonable or inconsistent with sound, evidence-based medical practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a request for an independent review determination has been made, the independent review organization must proceed to a final determination, unless requested otherwise by both the carrier and the enrollee or the enrollee's representative.</p>

<li>
<p>An enrollee or carrier may request an expedited external review if the adverse benefit determination or internal adverse benefit determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for which the claimant received emergency services but has not been discharged from a facility; or involves a medical condition for which the standard external review time frame would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or jeopardize the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function. The independent review organization must make its decision to uphold or reverse the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination and notify the enrollee and the carrier or health plan of the determination as expeditiously as possible but within not more than seventy-two hours after the receipt of the request for expedited external review. If the notice is not in writing, the independent review organization must provide written confirmation of the decision within forty-eight hours after the date of the notice of the decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For claims involving experimental or investigational treatments, the independent review organization must ensure that adequate clinical and scientific experience and protocols are taken into account as part of the external review process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carriers must timely implement the certified independent review organization's determination, and must pay the certified independent review organization's charges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an enrollee requests independent review of a dispute under this section, and the dispute involves a carrier's decision to modify, reduce, or terminate an otherwise covered health service that an enrollee is receiving at the time the request for review is submitted and the carrier's decision is based upon a finding that the health service, or level of health service, is no longer medically necessary or appropriate, the carrier must continue to provide the health service if requested by the enrollee until a determination is made under this section. If the determination affirms the carrier's decision, the enrollee may be responsible for the cost of the continued health service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each certified independent review organization must maintain written records and make them available upon request to the commissioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A certified independent review organization may notify the office of the insurance commissioner if, based upon its review of disputes under this section, it finds a pattern of substandard or egregious conduct by a carrier.</p>

</li>

<p>All individual and small group health plans must cover the ten essential health benefits categories, other than a health plan offered through the federal basic health program, a grandfathered health plan, or medicaid.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Must ensure that the plan covers the ten essential health benefits categories;</p>

The list must include the anticipated costs to the state of each state-mandated health benefit on the list and any statutory changes needed if funds are not appropriated to defray the state costs for the listed mandate.

Medical necessity review must be based on the standard set of criteria established under RCW 41.05.528. If the health plan determines within one business day from the start of the medical necessity review period and receipt of the material provided under (c)(ii) of this subsection that the admission to the facility was not medically necessary and advises the agency of the decision in writing, the health plan is not required to pay the facility for services delivered after the start of the medical necessity review period, subject to the conclusion of a filed appeal of the adverse benefit determination. If the health plan's medical necessity review is completed more than one business day after [the] start of the medical necessity review period and receipt of the material provided under (c)(ii) of this subsection, the health plan must pay for the services delivered from the time of admission until the time at which the medical necessity review is completed and the agency is advised of the decision in writing.</p>

<li>
<p>When the treatment plan approved by the health plan involves transfer of the enrollee to a different facility or to a lower level of care, the care coordination unit of the health plan shall work with the current agency to make arrangements for a seamless transfer as soon as possible to an appropriate and available facility or level of care. The health plan shall pay the agency for the cost of care at the current facility until the seamless transfer to the different facility or lower level of care is complete. A seamless transfer to a lower level of care may include same day or next day appointments for outpatient care, and does not include payment for nontreatment services, such as housing services. If placement with an agency in the health plan's network is not available, the health plan shall pay the current agency until a seamless transfer arrangement is made.</p>
