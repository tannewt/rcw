</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in consultation with the commission and the workforce training and education coordinating board, shall use the proceeds from the surcharge imposed under subsection (1) of this section to provide grants to a central nursing resource center. The grants may be awarded only to a not-for-profit central nursing resource center that is comprised of and led by nurses.

The central nursing resource center shall have as its mission to contribute to the health and wellness of Washington state residents by ensuring that there is an adequate nursing workforce to meet the current and future health care needs of the citizens of the state of Washington. The grants may be used to fund the following activities of the central nursing resource center:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Maintain information on the current and projected supply and demand of nurses through the collection and analysis of data regarding the nursing workforce, including but not limited to education level, race and ethnicity, employment settings, nursing positions, reasons for leaving the nursing profession, and those leaving Washington state to practice elsewhere. This data collection and analysis must complement other state activities to produce data on the nursing workforce and the central nursing resource center shall work collaboratively with other entities in the data collection to ensure coordination and avoid duplication of efforts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor and validate trends in the applicant pool for programs in nursing. The central nursing resource center must work with nursing leaders to identify approaches to address issues arising related to the trends identified, and collect information on other states' approaches to addressing these issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate partnerships between the nursing community and other health care providers, licensing authority, business and industry, consumers, legislators, and educators to achieve policy consensus, promote diversity within the profession, and enhance nursing career mobility and nursing leadership development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate the effectiveness of nursing education and articulation among programs to increase access to nursing education and enhance career mobility, especially for populations that are underrepresented in the nursing profession;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide consultation, technical assistance, data, and information related to Washington state and national nursing resources;</p>
</li>
<li>

Expenditures from the account may be used only for grants to an organization to conduct the specific activities listed in subsection (2) of this section and to compensate the department for the reasonable costs associated with the collection and distribution of the surcharge and the administration of the grant provided for in subsection (2) of this section. No money from this account may be used by the recipient towards administrative costs of the central nursing resource center not associated with the specific activities listed in subsection (2) of this section. No money from this account may be used by the recipient toward lobbying. Only the secretary or the secretary's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. Grants will be awarded on an annual basis and funds will be distributed quarterly. The first distribution after awarding the first grant shall be made no later than six months after July 24, 2005.

Such direction must be for acts which are within the scope of registered nursing practice.</p>

<li>
<p>A registered nurse may delegate tasks of nursing care to other individuals where the registered nurse determines that it is in the best interest of the patient.</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Except as authorized in (b) or (e) of this subsection, a registered nurse may not delegate the administration of medications. Except as authorized in (e) of this subsection, a registered nurse may not delegate acts requiring substantial skill, and may not delegate piercing or severing of tissues. Acts that require nursing judgment shall not be delegated.</p>

<p>No person may coerce a nurse into compromising patient safety by requiring the nurse to delegate if the nurse determines that it is inappropriate to do so. Nurses shall not be subject to any employer reprisal or disciplinary action by the nursing care quality assurance commission for refusing to delegate tasks or refusing to provide the required training for delegation if the nurse determines delegation may compromise patient safety.</p>

<li>
<p>For delegation in community-based care settings or in-home care settings, a registered nurse may delegate nursing care tasks only to registered or certified nursing assistants or home care aides certified under chapter 18.88B RCW. Simple care tasks such as blood pressure monitoring, personal care service, diabetic insulin device set up, verbal verification of insulin dosage for sight-impaired individuals, or other tasks as defined by the nursing care quality assurance commission are exempted from this requirement.</p>

Community-based care settings do not include acute care or skilled nursing facilities.</p>

<p>&quot;In-home care settings&quot; include an individual's place of temporary or permanent residence, but does not include acute care or skilled nursing facilities, and does not include community-based care settings as defined in (e)(i) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delegation of nursing care tasks in community-based care settings and in-home care settings is only allowed for individuals who have a stable and predictable condition. &quot;Stable and predictable condition&quot; means a situation in which the individual's clinical and behavioral status is known and does not require the frequent presence and evaluation of a registered nurse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The determination of the appropriateness of delegation of a nursing task is at the discretion of the registered nurse. Other than delegation of the administration of insulin by injection for the purpose of caring for individuals with diabetes, the administration of medications by injection, sterile procedures, and central line maintenance may never be delegated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When delegating insulin injections under this section, the registered nurse delegator must instruct the individual regarding proper injection procedures and the use of insulin, demonstrate proper injection procedures, and must supervise and evaluate the individual performing the delegated task weekly during the first four weeks of delegation of insulin injections. If the registered nurse delegator determines that the individual is competent to perform the injection properly and safely, supervision and evaluation shall occur at least every ninety days thereafter.</p>

<p>Before commencing any specific nursing tasks authorized to be delegated in this section, a home care aide must be certified pursuant to chapter 18.88B RCW and must comply with RCW 18.88B.070.</p>
