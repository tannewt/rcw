<p>For a hospital licensed under chapter 70.41 RCW, the license of location provided under this section may include any individual practitioner's office or multipractitioner clinic owned, operated, or under common control with a hospital, and identified by the hospital on the pharmacy application or renewal. The definition of &quot;hospital&quot; under RCW 70.41.020 to exclude &quot;clinics, or physician's offices where patients are not regularly kept as bed patients for twenty-four hours or more,&quot; does not limit the ability of a hospital to include individual practitioner's offices or multipractitioner clinics owned, operated, or under common control with a hospital on the pharmacy application or renewal or otherwise prevent the implementation of chapter 118, Laws of 2016. A hospital that elects to include one or more offices or clinics under this subsection on its hospital pharmacy application shall describe the type of services relevant to the practice of pharmacy provided at each such office or clinic as requested by the commission. Any updates to the application, renewal, or related forms that are necessary to accomplish the provision of this licensure option must be made no later than ninety days after June 9, 2016. Nothing in this section limits the ability of a hospital to transfer drugs to another location consistent with federal laws and RCW 70.41.490, regardless of whether or not an election has been made with respect to adding the receiving location to the hospital's pharmacy license under this section.</p>

<li>
<p>This chapter must be interpreted in a manner that supports regulatory, inspection, and investigation standards that are reasonable and appropriate based on the level of risk and the type of services provided in a pharmacy, including pharmacy services provided in a hospital and pharmacy services provided in an individual practitioner office or multipractitioner clinic owned, operated, or under common control with a hospital regardless of the office or clinic's physical address. The commission shall provide clear and specific information regarding the standards to which particular pharmacy services will be held, as appropriate, based on the type of pharmacy service provided at a particular location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary may adopt rules to establish an additional reasonable fee for any such office or clinic.</p>

<p>It shall be the duty of the owner to immediately notify the commission of any change of location, ownership, or licensure and to keep the license of location or the renewal thereof properly exhibited in said pharmacy.</p>

<li>
<p>Failure to comply with this section shall be deemed a misdemeanor, and each day that said failure continues shall be deemed a separate offense.</p>

<p>In the event such license fee remains unpaid on the date due, no renewal or new license shall be issued except upon compliance with administrative procedures, administrative requirements, and fees determined as provided in RCW 43.70.250 and 43.70.280.</p>

<p>If the commission determines that rules are necessary for the immediate implementation of the inspection standards described in this section, it must adopt rules under the emergency rule-making process in RCW 34.05.350, with such emergency rules effective not later than ninety days after June 9, 2016. The commission shall then begin the process to adopt any necessary permanent rules in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW. The commission shall ensure that during the transition to the permanent rules adopted under this section, an emergency rule remains in effect without a break between the original emergency rule and any subsequent emergency rules that may be necessary. The commission shall ensure that during the transition to permanent rules there is no interruption in provision of the licensure option described under this section.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that the practice of pharmacy is a dynamic, patient-oriented health service that applies a scientific body of knowledge to improve and promote patient health by means of appropriate drug use and drug-related therapy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that with the proliferation of alternate methods of health delivery, there has arisen among third-party payors and insurance companies the desire to control the cost and utilization of pharmacy services through a variety of mechanisms, including the use of mail-order pharmacies located outside the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, the legislature finds and declares that to continue to protect the Washington consumer-patient, all out-of-state pharmacies, including those located in Canada, that provide services to Washington residents shall be licensed by the department of health, disclose specific information about their services, and provide pharmacy services at a high level of protection and competence.</p>

<p>The registered or licensed pharmacist under this chapter shall establish and maintain a procedure for disclosing to physicians and other health care providers with prescriptive authority information detailed by prescriber, of the cost and dispensation of all prescriptive medications prescribed by him or her for his or her patients on request. These charges should be made available on at least a quarterly basis for all requested patients and should include medication, dosage, number dispensed, and the cost of the prescription. Pharmacies may provide this information in a summary form for each prescribing physician for all patients rather than as individually itemized reports. All efforts should be made to utilize the existing computerized records and software to provide this information in the least costly format.</p>

<li>
<p>A pharmacy may resupply a legend drug to a patient at a long-term care facility or hospice program pursuant to a valid chart order that is signed by the prescribing practitioner, is not time limited, and has not been discontinued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pharmacy may outsource shared pharmacy services for a long-term care facility or hospice program to another pharmacy if the outsourcing pharmacy:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Obtains approval from the long-term care facility or hospice program to outsource shared pharmacy services for the facility's or program's residents or patients; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides a copy of the prescription or order to the pharmacy providing the shared pharmacy services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared pharmacy services may be used for, but are not limited to, the purpose of ensuring that drugs or devices are attainable to meet the immediate needs of residents of the long-term care facility or hospice program, or when the outsourcing pharmacy cannot provide services on an ongoing basis. Where a pharmacy uses shared pharmacy services to have a second pharmacy provide a first dose or partial fill of a prescription or drug order to meet a patient's or resident's immediate needs, the second supplying pharmacy may dispense the first dose or partially filled prescription on a satellite basis without the outsourcing pharmacy being required to fully transfer the prescription to the supplying pharmacy. The supplying pharmacy must retain a copy of the prescription or order on file, a copy of the dispensing record or fill, and must notify the outsourcing pharmacy of the service and quantity provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pharmacy may repackage and dispense unused drugs returned by a long-term care facility or hospice program to the pharmacy in per-use, blister packaging, whether in unit dose or modified unit dose form, except as prohibited by federal law. The commission must adopt rules providing for the safe and efficient repackaging, reuse, and disposal of unused drugs returned to a pharmacy from a long-term care facility or hospice program. In adopting rules, the commission must take into consideration the acceptance and dispensing requirements of RCW 69.70.050 (1), (2), and (5).</p>
