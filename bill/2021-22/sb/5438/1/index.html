<h2 id="section-1-1673">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1673">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unemployment insurance was established by the legislature because it explicitly recognized that economic insecurity caused by unemployment is the &quot;greatest hazard of our economic life&quot; that &quot;falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his or her family&quot; which therefore requires &quot;the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves&quot; to reduce the suffering caused by unemployment to a minimum. Unemployment insurance is essential to ensure that individuals who lose income are able to survive and meet their basic needs during periods they are unable to find stable work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most Washington unemployed workers are eligible to receive unemployment insurance to survive and meet their basic needs in times of crisis, as the legislature intended. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented the worst unemployment crisis in decades. According to the employment security department, one in three Washington workers filed for unemployment during the initial months of the COVID-19 crisis and by August 2020, the state had paid out $10,000,000,000 in unemployment insurance to unemployed workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many immigrant workers, however, are not eligible for unemployment insurance or pandemic unemployment assistance and have not received any assistance from the program. RCW 50.20.098 provides that unemployment insurance benefits shall not be payable unless the individual &quot;was lawfully admitted for permanent residence, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or otherwise was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed...&quot;. Federal law, 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1621(d), requires that states wishing to extend benefits beyond a short list of &quot;qualified&quot; immigrants must affirmatively do so. Those ineligible to receive unemployment benefits include workers without work authorization, workers whose work authorization is awaiting renewal, and workers who recently regularized their immigration status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ineligibility for unemployment benefits has devastated immigrant communities during the pandemic economic crisis, particularly immigrants working in low-wage industries. Several of the industries that have experienced the highest rates of job loss in Washington due to the pandemic are low-wage sectors with the highest numbers of immigrant workers including the restaurant, hotel, retail, and construction industries. Economists predict large-scale permanent job loss and long-term unemployment as the effects of the pandemic similar to the great recession of 2008. Without access to unemployment benefits among other critical safety net programs Washington's immigrant communities face deep economic devastation for years to come. Prior to the pandemic, the poverty rate of immigrants in Washington was already high, with 18 percent of the state's immigrant residents living in poverty compared to 12 percent of United States born residents. The crisis is expected to significantly expand this disparity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support the survival of Washington's immigrant workers and families during periods of crisis, particularly low-income households, and to provide the safety net that United States born Washington residents are able to access, the legislature intends to establish a weekly unemployment benefits program similar to the state unemployment insurance program for workers not eligible for state or federal unemployment insurance benefits and unemployed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this bill would direct the agency to develop proposals for the creation of a permanent weekly unemployment benefits program for unemployed immigrant workers and, until the permanent program can be created, an interim program to cover excluded immigrant workers during disasters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-1328">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1328">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A Washington income replacement for immigrant workers program is created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide unemployment benefits to low-income workers who are unemployed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and not eligible for state or federal unemployment benefits administered by the employment security department due to immigration status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to allow persons who are not lawfully present in the United States, as members of the class of workers excluded from unemployment insurance benefits, to participate in, and receive disbursements from, the Washington unemployment benefits for immigrant workers program. This chapter is therefore enacted pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1621(d).</p>
