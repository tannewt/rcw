<p>The legislature finds that chronic and unsheltered homelessness is a growing problem in our state. While the rest of the country as a whole has experienced a decline in each of these categories over the last 10 years, Washington state has seen the number of chronic and unsheltered homeless in the state continue to grow, experiencing the second largest increase in the country.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that policies enacted to date have not worked, despite Washingtonians putting in billions of dollars to alleviate and address the problem. Individuals experiencing chronic and unsheltered homelessness, along with the residents of the state, deserve better. It is in the interest of the state to enact policies that create a path to entering into society and living functional, productive lives. This goal requires addressing public safety, recovery from addiction, and housing security.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature with this act to enact policies that will reduce both the incidences and impacts of chronic and unsheltered homelessness in our state.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall annually conduct a Washington homeless census or count consistent with the requirements of RCW 43.185C.180. The census shall make every effort to count all homeless individuals living outdoors, in shelters, and in transitional housing, coordinated, when reasonably feasible, with already existing homeless census projects including those funded in part by the United States department of housing and urban development under the McKinney-Vento homeless assistance program. <strong>In addition, the census shall make every effort to count individuals who are currently admitted into hospitals or incarcerated in city or county jails who had no permanent address at the time of admission.</strong> The department shall determine, in consultation with local governments, the data to be collected. Data on subpopulations and other characteristics of the homeless must, at a minimum, be consistent with the United States department of housing and urban development's point-in-time requirements. <strong>Data and information collected about individuals who are currently admitted into hospitals or incarcerated in city or county jails and had no permanent address at the time of admission are not required to be submitted to the United States department of urban housing and development to ensure uniformity of information across states.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All personal information collected in the census is confidential, and the department and each local government shall take all necessary steps to protect the identity and confidentiality of each person counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department and each local government are prohibited from disclosing any personally identifying information about any homeless individual when there is reason to believe or evidence indicating that the homeless individual is an adult or minor victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking or is the parent or guardian of a child victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or revealing other confidential information regarding HIV/AIDS status, as found in RCW 70.02.220. The department and each local government shall not ask any homeless housing provider to disclose personally identifying information about any homeless individuals when the providers implementing those programs have reason to believe or evidence indicating that those clients are adult or minor victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking or are the parents or guardians of child victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Summary data for the provider's facility or program may be substituted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington homeless census shall be conducted annually on a schedule created by the department. The department shall make summary data by county available to the public each year. This data, and its analysis, shall be included in the department's annual updated homeless housing program strategic plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the annual census and provider information from the local government plans, the department shall, by the end of year four, implement an online information and referral system to enable local governments and providers to identify available housing for a homeless person. The department shall work with local governments and their providers to develop a capacity for continuous case management to assist homeless persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the end of year four, the department shall implement an organizational quality management system.</p>

<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 6 and 7, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (sections 6 and 7 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a) and (c).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage the employment of certain unemployed persons, such as persons convicted of a felony and homeless persons. It is the legislature's intent to provide employers a credit against the business and occupation tax or public utility tax for hiring certain unemployed persons which would reduce an employer's tax burden thereby inducing employers to hire and create jobs for such persons. Pursuant to chapter 43.136 RCW, the joint legislative audit and review committee must review the business and occupation tax and public utility tax credit established under sections 6 and 7, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (sections 6 and 7 of this act) by December 31, 2031.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a review finds that the number of unemployed persons who meet the criteria in section 6(7)(c)(i) or 7(7)(c)(i) of this act decreased by 30 percent, then the legislature intends for the legislative auditor to recommend extending the expiration date of the tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee should refer to unemployment rates available from the employment security department and the bureau of labor statistics.</p>
