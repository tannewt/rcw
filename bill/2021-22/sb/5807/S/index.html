<li>
<p>Each state hospital shall include in its admission process identification of family and natural supports for the patient, an explanation to each patient of the role of the bureau, and determination of whether informed consent exists for involvement of family or natural supports in the patient's care. If the patient does not have the capacity to provide informed consent for this purpose, the involvement of family or natural supports shall be determined by consulting the patient's guardian or in a manner consistent with RCW 70.02.205.</p>
</li>

The legislature finds that establishment of institutes for the study and treatment of mental disorders at  eastern state hospital <strong>,</strong> western state hospital**, and the child study and treatment center** will be instrumental in implementing the legislative intent.</p>
