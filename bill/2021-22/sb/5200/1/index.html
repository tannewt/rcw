<p>Except as provided under subsection (4) of this section, a tax credit claimed under this section may not be carried over to another year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any amount of tax credit otherwise allowable under this section not claimed by the person in any calendar year may be carried over and claimed against the person's tax liability for the next succeeding calendar year.
