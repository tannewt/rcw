</li>
<li>
<p>If a federal home loan bank exercises its rights regarding collateral pledged by an insurer member who is subject to a delinquency proceeding, the federal home loan bank shall repurchase any outstanding capital stock that is in excess of that amount of federal home loan bank stock that the insurer member is required to hold as a minimum investment, to the extent the federal home loan bank in good faith determines the repurchase to be permissible under applicable laws, regulations, regulatory obligations, and the federal home loan bank's capital plan, and consistent with the federal home loan bank's current capital stock practices applicable to its entire membership.</p>

However, a transfer may be avoided under this subsection if the transfer was made with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the insurer member, the receiver for the insurer member, or existing or future creditors. This subsection shall not affect a receiver's rights regarding advances to an insurer member in delinquency proceedings under 12 C.F.R. Part 1266.4.</p>
