<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that whole-person care that includes access to behavioral health, care coordination, and social supports at the point of entry is essential for families. In 2021, over 44 percent of middle school students and 57 percent of high school students reported feeling depressed most days. One in five mothers suffer from mood disorders after birth while only 16 percent receive treatment. Meanwhile, 78 percent of primary care doctors who refer kids for behavioral health care receive no further information or coordination after the referral. Multiform strategies are needed to meet kids and families where they are to deliver needed behavioral health interventions and social supports. While current initiatives, like certified community behavioral health clinics, promise to expand access to integrated care and care coordination for families that present to behavioral health clinics, it is necessary to plan for whole-person care throughout the delivery system, including for families whose primary point of entry is through primary care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the unique relationship between primary care providers and patients makes primary care well positioned to deploy integrated whole-person care strategies that include behavioral health and social supports. Primary care is a main driver of prevention and early detection, so investment in improved primary care services, connectivity to other parts of the delivery system, and patient engagement will improve patient outcomes and lower the total cost of care. To achieve these outcomes, the legislature intends to invest in primary care transformation accomplished through a multipayer primary care transformation model developed by the health care authority in consultation with stakeholders across the health delivery system.</p>
