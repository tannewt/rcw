<blockquote>
<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/34_administrative_law/34.05_administrative_procedure_act.html">34.05.328</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/34_administrative_law/34.05_administrative_procedure_act.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before adopting a rule described in subsection (5) of this section, an agency must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Clearly state in detail the general goals and specific objectives of the statute that the rule implements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine that the rule is needed to achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection, and analyze alternatives to rule making and the consequences of not adopting the rule;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide notification in the notice of proposed rule making under RCW 34.05.320 that a preliminary cost-benefit analysis is available. The preliminary cost-benefit analysis must fulfill the requirements of the cost-benefit analysis under (d) of this subsection. If the agency files a supplemental notice under RCW 34.05.340, the supplemental notice must include notification that a revised preliminary cost-benefit analysis is available. A final cost-benefit analysis must be available when the rule is adopted under RCW 34.05.360;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine that the probable benefits of the rule are greater than its probable costs, taking into account both the qualitative and quantitative benefits and costs and the specific directives of the statute being implemented;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine, after considering alternative versions of the rule and the analysis required under (b), (c), and (d) of this subsection, that the rule being adopted is the least burdensome alternative for those required to comply with it that will achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine that the rule does not require those to whom it applies to take an action that violates requirements of another federal or state law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine that the rule does not impose more stringent performance requirements on private entities than on public entities unless required to do so by federal or state law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine if the rule differs from any federal regulation or statute applicable to the same activity or subject matter and, if so, determine that the difference is justified by the following:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A state statute that explicitly allows the agency to differ from federal standards; or</p>
<ol type="i" start="2">
<li>
<p>Substantial evidence that the difference is necessary to achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate the rule, to the maximum extent practicable, with other federal, state, and local laws applicable to the same activity or subject matter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In making its determinations pursuant to subsection (1)(b) through (h) of this section, the agency must place in the rule-making file documentation of sufficient quantity and quality so as to persuade a reasonable person that the determinations are justified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before adopting rules described in subsection (5) of this section, an agency must place in the rule-making file a rule implementation plan for rules filed under each adopting order. The plan must describe how the agency intends to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Implement and enforce the rule, including a description of the resources the agency intends to use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform and educate affected persons about the rule;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote and assist voluntary compliance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate whether the rule achieves the purpose for which it was adopted, including, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of interim milestones to assess progress and the use of objectively measurable outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After adopting a rule described in subsection (5) of this section regulating the same activity or subject matter as another provision of federal or state law, an agency must do all of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Coordinate implementation and enforcement of the rule with the other federal and state entities regulating the same activity or subject matter by making every effort to do one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Deferring to the other entity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designating a lead agency; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entering into an agreement with the other entities specifying how the agency and entities will coordinate implementation and enforcement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the agency is unable to comply with this subsection (4)(a), the agency must report to the legislature pursuant to (b) of this subsection;</p>
<pre><code>b. Report to the  rules review committee:

    i. The existence of any overlap or duplication of other federal or state laws, any differences from federal law, and any known overlap, duplication, or conflict with local laws; and

    ii. Make recommendations for any legislation that may be necessary to eliminate or mitigate any adverse effects of such overlap, duplication, or difference.
