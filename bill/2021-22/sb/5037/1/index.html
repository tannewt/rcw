<h2 id="section-1-1563">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1563">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that school districts and charter schools are faced with challenging decisions regarding how to operate their schools during COVID-19 and whether they should offer in-person learning, distance learning, or hybrid or rotating schedules. The legislature recognizes that full-time, distance learning presents many challenges and hardships to students and families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the best metric for determining prevalence of COVID-19 in a community is tied to the positivity standard within a county. This metric does not punish communities for testing more, as does a metric tied to cases per population. Further, the positivity metrics are linked to the world health organization metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish clear school opening metrics based on the positivity standard within counties, so these decisions are transparent and uniform throughout the state of Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-1244">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-1244">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.630_temporary_provisions%E2%80%94special_projects.html">28A.630</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.630_temporary_provisions%E2%80%94special_projects.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the governor proclaims a state of emergency under chapter 43.06 RCW in response to COVID-19, school districts must use the metrics in this section to determine the education modality for the schools by county.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>School districts in counties below a five percent positivity standard must offer in-person learning to all students. To move out of this category, counties must be above a five percent positivity standard for two weeks in a row.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts in counties above a five percent positivity standard may choose the education modality for their students. To move out of this category, counties must be below a five percent positivity standard for two weeks in a row.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a school district is located in more than one county, a school district must determine the average positivity standard of all the counties in which it is located to determine the education modality under subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is an outbreak of COVID-19 at a particular school, a school district and local health officer, in accordance with other state laws, must take all appropriate actions deemed necessary to control or eliminate the spread of COVID-19 within the affected school including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Closing part or all of the affected school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Canceling activities or functions at the affected school; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excluding from the affected school any students, staff, and volunteers who are infectious, or exposed and susceptible to the disease.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Education modality&quot; means the type of setting to deliver education services including, but not limited to, in-person learning, distance learning, and hybrid or rotating schedules with in-person learning and distance learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Outbreak&quot; means the school meets the following criteria: (i) Two or more cases of laboratory positive COVID-19 among students or staff; (ii) the cases have symptom onsets within a fourteen-day period of each other; (iii) plausible epidemiological-linkage in the school; and (iv) no other known epidemiological-linkage outside of the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Positivity standard&quot; means the percent of individuals testing positive for COVID-19. It must be calculated by comparing the number of individuals testing positive over the past week to the total number of tests during that week.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section is a state health requirement under RCW 28A.710.040 and applies to charter schools established in accordance with chapter 28A.710 RCW.</p>
