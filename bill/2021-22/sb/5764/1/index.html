<h2 id="section-1-1675">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1675">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes the institutional costs of community and technical colleges to deliver, host, and contract related supplemental instruction for state registered apprenticeships. It is the intent of the legislature to provide dedicated funding support for full-time equivalent student apprenticeship enrollments at the community and technical colleges and that it be phased in over five fiscal years, beginning in fiscal year 2023. If specific funding for dedicated support in this section is not provided in the 2021-2023 supplemental omnibus operating appropriations act, the five-year phase-in of dedicated support proposed must be delayed until such time as specific funding is provided.</p>

<p>The state board for community and technical colleges must fully implement this goal by the beginning of the 2025-26 academic year.</p>

<li>
<p>Review the current funding model for apprentices within the community and technical college system.

</li>
<li>
<p>The apprenticeship council, in consultation with the state board for community and technical colleges, the student achievement council, and an organization representing the presidents of the public four-year institutions of higher education, shall explore whether the state should establish an institution, or centralized program, for apprentices to receive related supplemental instruction for credit towards a degree.

<p>An apprenticeship committee may recommend to its community or technical college partner or partners that an associate degree pathway be developed for the committee's program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with the state board for community and technical colleges, the apprenticeship committee and the college or colleges involved with the program shall consider the extent apprentices in the program are likely to pursue an associate degree and the extent a pathway could reduce redundancy of course requirements between the apprenticeship and a degree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the apprenticeship committee and the college or colleges involved with the program determine that a pathway would be beneficial for apprentices and assist them in obtaining an associate degree, the apprenticeship committee may request that a pathway be established as provided in RCW 28B.50.890.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>For active state apprenticeship programs registered during or before July 1, 2022, the credit or course equivalencies must be established by the 2028-29 school year.
