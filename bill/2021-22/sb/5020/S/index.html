<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes a need to protect the safety, health, and economic well-being of Washington residents by guarding them from the negative and harmful impact of unsupported price increases for prescription drugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Access to prescription drugs is necessary for people to maintain or acquire good health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsupported price increases negatively impact the ability of people to obtain prescription drugs and thereby endanger the health and safety of such people by making it difficult for them to maintain or acquire good health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs threaten the economic well-being of Washington residents and endanger their ability to pay for other necessary and essential goods and services, including housing, food, and utilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs contribute significantly to a dramatic and unsustainable rise in health care costs and health insurance, which threatens the overall ability of people to obtain health coverage and maintain or acquire good health; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsupported price increases for prescription drugs contribute significantly to rising state costs for health care provided and paid for through state-funded medical assistance programs for Washington residents who are older, are living with disabilities, or have low incomes; and health insurance programs for public employees, including employees of the state, municipalities and counties, school districts, institutions of higher education, and retirees whose health care costs are funded by public programs, thereby threatening the ability of the state to fund those programs adequately and further threatening the ability of the state to fund other programs necessary for the public good and safety, such as public education and public safety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of the increase in prices charged by manufacturers of prescription drugs demonstrates that many price increases for high-cost and high-volume prescription drugs are not supported by adequate evidence of improved clinical benefit or by significant increase in costs to the manufacturer related to the production or sale of the product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the findings contained in this section, the legislature intends to pass this act as an essential means to protect the health and well-being of Washington residents from the negative impacts of unsupported price increases.</p>
