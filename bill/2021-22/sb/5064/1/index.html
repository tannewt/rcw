In determining whether work is suitable for an individual, the commissioner shall also consider the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety, and morals, the individual's physical fitness, the individual's length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in the individual's customary occupation, the distance of the available work from the individual's residence, <strong>the individual's responsibilities to provide care for a child or vulnerable adult in the individual's care,</strong> and such other factors as the commissioner may deem pertinent, including state and national emergencies.</p>
