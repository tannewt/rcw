<h2 id="section-1-1097">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1097">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the nearly year-long absence from in-person learning that resulted, has taken a significant toll on the academic progress of K-12 students. Due to reduced instructional time, disruption to core educational services, and isolation from support staff and peers, many students have suffered learning loss. To combat this learning loss, the legislature intends to establish a K-12 intensive tutoring grant program so that schools and school districts may offer one-on-one tutoring support to students. Studies show that one-on-one tutoring is one of the most successful and cost-effective education interventions that addresses both the academic and social needs of students. Through the use of these innovative tutoring services, schools and school districts can provide access to personalized supports that address each student's unique needs and restore academic progress.</p>
