<h2 id="section-1-180">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-180">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that temporary suspension of the early achievers program, the state's quality rating and improvement system for early learning and child care providers, may lead to greater stability for providers and fewer child care deserts in Washington. Through proclamation, the governor explained that waiving and suspending the state's quality rating and improvement requirements will help make child care available to children of essential staff and children from low-income families who need child care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislature intends to extend the temporary suspension of the early achievers program to July 1, 2022, to support providers during COVID-19 and to allow time for the legislature to devote more resources to the system.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The department, in collaboration with tribal governments and community and statewide partners, shall implement a quality rating and improvement system, called the early achievers program. The early achievers program provides a foundation of quality for the early care and education system. The early achievers program is applicable to licensed or certified child care centers and homes and early learning programs such as working connections child care and early childhood education and assistance programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The objectives of the early achievers program are to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Improve short-term and long-term educational outcomes for children as measured by assessments including, but not limited to, the Washington kindergarten inventory of developing skills in RCW 28A.655.080;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give parents clear and easily accessible information about the quality of child care and early education programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support improvement in early learning and child care programs throughout the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the readiness of children for school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the disparities in access to quality care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide professional development and coaching opportunities to early child care and education providers; and</p>
</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Licensed or certified child care centers and homes serving nonschool-age children and receiving state subsidy payments must participate in the early achievers program by the required deadlines established in RCW 43.216.135.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approved early childhood education and assistance program providers receiving state-funded support must participate in the early achievers program by the required deadlines established in RCW 43.216.515.</p>

<p>School-age child care providers are exempt from participating in the early achievers program. By July 1, 2017, the department and the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall jointly design a plan to incorporate school-age child care providers into the early achievers program or other appropriate quality improvement system. To test implementation of the early achievers system for school-age child care providers the department and the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall implement a pilot program.</p>
