<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washingtonians need improved access to high-speed internet now more than ever to meet a variety of demands including, but not limited to, remote work, distance learning, telehealth, emergency response and public safety, agriculture, innovation, and commerce;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-speed internet is delivered to Washingtonians through wireline and wireless broadband infrastructure that is installed either aerially or underground. Wireless broadband service relies on wireline facilities, especially fiber backhaul lines;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deployment of fiber is critical to connect more Washingtonians to broadband;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick and cost-effective ways to install fiber include trenching, boring, and microtrenching; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By expediting fiber deployment, cities, towns, and counties will help expedite the availability of broadband access across Washington.</p>
</li>
