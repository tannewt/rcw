<p>There is created a commission to be known as the Washington citizens' commission on salaries for elected officials, to consist of sixteen members appointed by the governor as provided in this section.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nine of the sixteen commission members shall be selected by lot by the secretary of state from among those registered voters eligible to vote at the time persons are selected for appointment to full terms on the commission under subsection (3) of this section. One member shall be selected from each congressional district. The secretary shall establish policies and procedures for conducting the selection by lot. The policies and procedures shall include, but not be limited to, those for notifying persons selected and for providing a new selection from a congressional district if a person selected from the district declines appointment to the commission or if, following the person's appointment, the person's position on the commission becomes vacant before the end of the person's term of office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remaining seven of the sixteen commission members, all residents of this state, shall be selected jointly by the speaker of the house of representatives and the president of the senate. The persons selected under this subsection shall have had experience in the field of personnel management. Of these seven members, one shall be selected from each of the following five sectors in this state: Private institutions of higher education; business; professional personnel management; legal profession; and organized labor. Of the two remaining members, one shall be a person recommended to the speaker and the president by the chair of the Washington personnel resources board and one shall be a person recommended by majority vote of the presidents of the state's four-year institutions of higher education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of state shall forward the names of persons selected under subsection (1) of this section and the speaker of the house of representatives and president of the senate shall forward the names of persons selected under subsection (2) of this section to the governor who shall appoint these persons to the commission. Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the names of persons selected for appointment to the commission shall be forwarded to the governor not later than February 15, 1987, and not later than the fifteenth day of February every four years through 1999. The terms of the members selected in 1999 shall terminate July 1, 2002, and the names of persons selected for appointment to the commission shall be forwarded to the governor not later than July 1, 2002. Of the sixteen names forwarded to the governor in 2002, the governor shall by lot select four of the persons selected under subsection (1) of this section and four of the persons selected under subsection (2) of this section to serve two-year terms, with the rest of the members serving four-year terms. Thereafter, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, all members shall serve four-year terms and the names of eight persons selected for appointment to the commission shall be forwarded to the governor not later than the first day of July every two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may be appointed to more than two terms. No member of the commission may be removed by the governor during his or her term of office unless for cause of incapacity, incompetence, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office or for a disqualifying change of residence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The unexcused absence of any person who is a member of the commission from two consecutive meetings of the commission shall constitute the relinquishment of that person's membership on the commission. Such a relinquishment creates a vacancy in that person's position on the commission. A member's absence may be excused by the chair of the commission upon the member's written request if the chair believes there is just cause for the absence. Such a request must be received by the chair before the meeting for which the absence is to be excused. A member's absence from a meeting of the commission may also be excused during the meeting for which the member is absent by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the commission present at the meeting.</p>
