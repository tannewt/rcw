<ol>
<li>
<p>If a person wrongfully takes shellfish or causes shellfish to be wrongfully taken from the public lands and the wrongful taking is intentional and knowing, the person is liable for damages of treble the fair market retail value of the amount of shellfish wrongfully taken. If a person wrongfully takes shellfish from the public lands under other circumstances, the person is liable for damages of double the fair market value of the amount of shellfish wrongfully taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, a person &quot;wrongfully takes&quot; shellfish from public lands if the person takes shellfish: (a) Above the limits of any applicable laws that govern the harvest of shellfish from public lands; (b) without reporting the harvest to the department of fish and wildlife or the department where the reporting is required by law or contract; (c) outside the area or above the limits that an agreement or contract from the department allows the harvest of shellfish from public lands; or (d) without a lease or purchase of the shellfish where the lease or purchase is required by law prior to harvest of the shellfish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedies in this section are for civil damages and shall be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. The department may file a civil action in Thurston county superior court or the county where the shellfish were taken against any person liable under this section. Damages recovered under this section shall be applied in the same way as received under geoduck harvesting agreements authorized by RCW 79.135.210.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of the remedies created by this section, the amount of shellfish wrongfully taken by a person may be established either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>By surveying the aquatic lands to reasonably establish the amount of shellfish taken from the immediate area where a person is shown to have been wrongfully taking shellfish;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By weighing the shellfish on board any vessel or in possession of a person shown to be wrongfully taking shellfish; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By any other evidence that reasonably establishes the amount of shellfish wrongfully taken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of shellfish established by (a) or (b) of this subsection shall be presumed to be the amount wrongfully taken unless the defendant shows by a preponderance of evidence that the shellfish were lawfully taken or that the defendant did not take the shellfish presumed to have been wrongfully taken. Whenever there is reason to believe that shellfish in the possession of any person were wrongfully taken, the department or the department of fish and wildlife may require the person to proceed to a designated off-load point and to weigh all shellfish in possession of the person or on board the person's vessel.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>This civil remedy is supplemental to the state's power to prosecute any person for theft of shellfish, for other crimes where shellfish are involved, or for violation of rules of the department of fish and wildlife.</li>

<p>Except as provided in RCW 79.135.040, geoducks shall be sold as valuable materials under the provisions of *chapter 79.90 RCW. After confirmation of the sale, the department may enter into an agreement with the purchaser for the harvesting of geoducks. The department may place terms and conditions in the harvesting agreements as the department deems necessary. The department may enforce the provisions of any harvesting agreement by suspending or canceling the harvesting agreement or through any other means contained in the harvesting agreement. Any geoduck harvester may terminate a harvesting agreement entered into pursuant to this subsection if actions of a governmental agency, beyond the control of the harvester, its agents, or its employees, prohibit harvesting, for a period exceeding thirty days during the term of the harvesting agreement, except as provided within the agreement. Upon termination of the agreement by the harvester, the harvester shall be reimbursed by the department for the cost paid to the department on the agreement, less the value of the harvest already accomplished by the harvester under the agreement.</p>

<li>
<p>Harvesting agreements under this title for the purpose of harvesting geoducks shall require the harvester and the harvester's agent or representatives to comply with all applicable commercial diving safety standards and regulations promulgated and implemented by the federal occupational safety and health administration established under the federal occupational safety and health act of 1970 as the law exists or as amended (84 Stat. 1590 et seq.; 29 U.S.C. Sec. 651 et seq.). However, for the purposes of this section and RCW 77.60.070, all persons who dive for geoducks are deemed to be employees as defined by the federal occupational safety and health act. All harvesting agreements shall provide that failure to comply with these standards is cause for suspension or cancellation of the harvesting agreement. Further, for the purposes of this subsection if the harvester contracts with another person or entity for the harvesting of geoducks, the harvesting agreement shall not be suspended or canceled if the harvester terminates its business relationship with such an entity until compliance with this subsection is secured.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2015, geoduck divers licensed under RCW 77.65.410 must annually complete the geoduck diver safety program established in RCW 43.30.560 in order to be maintained on a department of natural resources' harvest agreement plan of operation.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall, consistent with this section, and subject to available funding, work with partners to establish a native kelp forest and eelgrass meadow health and conservation plan that endeavors to, by the year 2040, conserve and restore at least 10,000 acres of native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows. The plan should proactively and systematically address:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The potential loss of native kelp forest and eelgrass meadow habitat throughout Puget Sound and along the Washington state coastline;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential current and future stressors related to the decline of native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awareness, action, and engagement tools being used by public and private entities in the Puget Sound region to raise awareness of the importance of conserving and restoring native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows and reducing stressors related to their decline.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop the plan to assess and prioritize areas for coordinated conservation and restoration actions. The plan must consist of the following elements: Assessment and prioritization; identifying coordinated actions and success measures; monitoring; and reporting.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department shall, together with partners, develop a framework to identify and prioritize native kelp forest and eelgrass meadow areas in greatest need of conservation or restoration. The framework must:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Incorporate conservation of native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows. Utilize and build on existing research to map and prioritize areas of native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows throughout Puget Sound and along the coast that are at highest risk of permanent loss, or contribute significant environmental, economic, and cultural benefits to tribal nations and local communities, including salmon recovery and water quality, and where opportunities for partnership and collaboration can accelerate progress towards the goal, and develop criteria by which an acre of kelp forests and eelgrass meadows can be considered to be conserved or restored;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify research necessary to analyze and assess potential ecological, environmental, and community benefits of aquaculture of native seaweed species;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Map and prioritize native kelp forest and eelgrass meadow areas throughout Puget Sound and along the coast where they were historically present, identifying priority locations for restoration, and where opportunities for partnership and collaboration exist that will accelerate progress towards the goal. This should include identification of sites where restoration may be possible and would most benefit nearshore ecosystem function, including where restoration could also support healthy kelp forests and eelgrass meadows, salmon recovery, water quality, and other ecosystem benefits, such as mitigating the negative effects of ocean acidification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify potential stressors impacting the health and vitality of native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows in prioritized areas in order to specifically address them in conservation and restoration efforts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing coordinated actions and success measures, the department shall:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Conduct an assessment and inventory of existing tools relevant to conserving and restoring native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows and reducing stressors related to their decline;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify new or amended tools that would support the goals of the plan created under this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify success measures to track progress toward the conservation and restoration goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the plan, the department shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Involve impacted communities using the community engagement plan developed under RCW 70A.02.050;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consult with federally recognized tribal nations, including consultation on the cultural and ecological importance of native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows now threatened by urbanization or other disturbances;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage and collaborate with state and federal agencies, such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, the Northwest straits commission, the department of ecology, the department of fish and wildlife, the Puget Sound partnership, the recreation and conservation office, and the marine resources advisory council;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage with representatives from other stakeholder groups that may have vested and direct interest in the outcomes of the plan including, but not limited to, shellfish growers, the boating industry, and recreational user communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2022, the department must submit a report in compliance with RCW 43.01.036 to the office of financial management and the appropriate committees of the legislature, to include community engagement plans and schedule for plan development. The native kelp forest and eelgrass meadow health and conservation plan must be finalized and submitted to the office of financial management and the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1, 2023, including a map and justification of identified priority areas based on collaboratively developed criteria, and a list of potential tools and actions for conservation or restoration of these priority areas. A monitoring plan based on the identified success measures will also be submitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequently, each biennium, the department shall continue to monitor the distributions and trends of native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows to inform adaptive management of the plan and coordinated partner actions. The department shall submit a report to the legislature that describes the native kelp forest and eelgrass meadow conservation priority areas, and monitoring approaches and findings, including success measures established in the plan. Beginning December 1, 2024, and by December 1st of each even-numbered year thereafter, the department shall provide the appropriate committees of the legislature and the office of financial management with:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An updated map of distributions and trends, and summary of success measures and findings, including relevant information from the prioritization process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An updated list summarizing potential stressors, prioritized areas, and corresponding coordinated actions and success measures. The summary must include any barriers to plan implementation and legislative or administrative recommendations to address those barriers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An update on the number of acres of native kelp forests and eelgrass meadows conserved by region, including restoration or loss in priority areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An update on consultation with federally recognized tribal nations; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An update on the department's community engagement plan or plans developed under RCW 70A.02.050.</p>
