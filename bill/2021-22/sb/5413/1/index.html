<h2 id="section-1-328">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-328">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act may be known and cited as the &quot;Solitary Confinement Restriction Act.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="section-2-263">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-263">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The use of solitary confinement in Washington state's correctional facilities should be restricted to ensure the safe and humane operation of these facilities, consistent with the state and federal Constitution, the laws and public policies of this state, the mission of the correctional system, evolving medical knowledge, and the human rights standards of decency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solitary confinement should only be used when necessary, and should not be used against vulnerable populations or under conditions or for time periods that foster psychological trauma, psychiatric disorders, or serious, long-term damage to a person's brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standards established in this act should apply to all incarcerated persons in the custody of the department of corrections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, the Washington state attorney general's office proposed legislation to ban the use of solitary confinement for juveniles; the bill passed with bipartisan support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 800 adults continue to be held in solitary confinement in Washington's prisons; solitary confinement is disproportionately imposed upon Black, indigenous, and Hispanic people in the state's prisons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the devastating and lasting psychological consequences of solitary confinement, recent studies have shown that people in these restrictive settings also have higher rates of medical concerns and have a shorter life expectancy once released to the community. Studies have also shown that people released to the community directly from solitary confinement also have higher recidivism rates.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incarcerated person who is a member of a vulnerable population because the incarcerated person is under 25 or over 60 years of age, has a serious medical condition that cannot be effectively treated in solitary confinement, a physical disability that cannot be accommodated in solitary confinement, has significant auditory or visual impairment, is pregnant, is in the postpartum period, or has recently suffered a miscarriage or terminated a pregnancy, and who would otherwise be placed in solitary confinement, shall alternately be placed in an appropriate medical or other unit as designated by the secretary.</p>

<li>
<p>Solitary confinement shall be permitted under limited circumstances as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">

Reports of these evaluations shall be immediately provided to the superintendent of the facility and the secretary.</p>
</li>

<p>A qualified medical provider, based on a personal examination, determines that an incarcerated person should be placed or retained in medical isolation. The decision to place and retain an incarcerated person in medical isolation due to a mental health emergency shall be made by a qualified medical provider based on a personal examination. In any case of isolation under this subsection, an in-person clinical review shall be conducted at least every six hours and as clinically indicated. An incarcerated person in medical isolation pursuant to this subsection shall be placed in a residential treatment unit, a close observation unit, or a medical unit, as designated by the secretary.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The facility shall keep a written record of a request by an incarcerated person to be placed in solitary confinement for the purposes of voluntary protective custody. The incarcerated person may be placed in voluntary protective custody only with informed, written consent and when there is reasonable cause to believe that confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm. When an incarcerated person makes an informed, written request for such protective custody, the correctional facility shall bear the burden of establishing a basis for refusing the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The incarcerated person may be placed in solitary confinement for involuntary protective custody only when there is clear and convincing evidence that such confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm and that a less restrictive intervention would not be sufficient to prevent the harm. Placement in solitary confinement for involuntary protective custody shall not exceed 72 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incarcerated person placed in solitary confinement for the purposes of protective custody shall receive comparable opportunities for activities, movement, and social interaction, consistent with their safety and the safety of others as are available to incarcerated persons in the general population of the facility.</p>

<p>An incarcerated person who may be placed or currently is in solitary confinement for the purposes of voluntary protective custody may opt out of that status by providing informed, written refusal of that status.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>The superintendent shall place an incarcerated person in a less restrictive intervention, including transfer to the general population of another institution or to any unit designated for incarcerated persons who face similar threats, before placing the incarcerated person in solitary confinement for either voluntary or involuntary protective custody unless the incarcerated person poses an extraordinary security risk so great that transferring the incarcerated person would be insufficient to ensure the incarcerated person's safety or the safety of others.</li>
