<h2 id="section-1-671">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-671">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing our state and the world today, an existential crisis with major negative impacts on environmental and human health. Washington is experiencing environmental and community impacts due to climate change through increasingly devastating wildfires, flooding, droughts, rising temperatures and sea levels, and ocean acidification. Greenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere will increase impacts for some period of time. Actions to increase resilience of our communities, natural resource lands, and ecosystems can prevent and reduce impacts to communities and our environment and improve their ability to recover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, the legislature updated the state's greenhouse gas emissions limits that are to be achieved by 2030, 2040, and 2050, based on current science and emissions trends, to support local and global efforts to avoid the most significant impacts from climate change. While these limits beneficially guide the implementation of all other state laws and policies that have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions in the state, meeting these limits will require coordinated, comprehensive, and multisectoral implementation of policies, programs, and laws, as currently enacted systems approaches are insufficient to meet the limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that while climate change is a global problem, there are communities that have historically borne the disproportionate impacts of environmental burdens and that now bear the disproportionate negative impacts of climate change. Although the state has done great work in the past to highlight these environmental health disparities, beginning with senator Rosa Franklin's environmental equity study, and continuing through the work of the governor's interagency council on health disparities, the creation of the Washington environmental health disparities map, and recommendations of the environmental justice task force, the state can do much more to ensure that state programs address environmental equity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that while enacted carbon policies can be well-intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide environmental benefits to communities, the policies may not do enough to ensure environmental health disparities are reduced and environmental benefits are provided to those communities most impacted by environmental harms from greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that wildfires have become one of the largest sources of black carbon in the last five years. From 2014 through 2018, wildfires in Washington state generated 39,200,000 metric tons of carbon, the equivalent of more than 8,500,000 cars on the road a year. In 2015, when 1,130,000 acres burned in Washington, wildfires were the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions releasing 17,975,112 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This pollution affects all Washingtonians, but falls disproportionately on low-income communities, communities of color, and the most vulnerable of our population. Restoring the health of our forests and investing in wildfire prevention and preparedness will therefore contribute to improved air quality and improved public health outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that by exercising a leadership role in addressing climate change, Washington will position its economy, technology centers, financial institutions, and manufacturers to benefit from national and international efforts that must occur to reduce greenhouse gases. The legislature intends to create climate policy that recognizes the special nature of emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries by minimizing leakage and increased life-cycle emissions associated with product imports. The legislature further finds that if appropriate climate policies are not enacted, leakage can occur that results in net increases in global greenhouse gas emissions and increased negative impacts to those communities most impacted by environmental harms from climate change. The legislature further intends to encourage these industries to continue to innovate, find new ways to be more energy efficient, use lower carbon products, and be positioned to be global leaders in a low carbon economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, in establishing a program to ensure that the state's 2030, 2040, and 2050 greenhouse gas emissions limits are achieved, the legislature intends to ensure that overburdened communities and vulnerable populations are no longer overlooked in the establishment of environmental policies. Under the program, the legislature intends to identify overburdened communities where the highest concentrations of criteria pollutants occur, determine the sources of those emissions and pollutants, and ensure that emissions or concentration reductions are achieved in those communities. The legislature further intends to conduct an environmental justice assessment to ensure that funds and programs created under this chapter provide direct and meaningful benefits to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities. Additionally, the legislature intends to prevent job loss and provide protective measures for workers adversely impacted by the transition to a clean energy economy through transition and assistance programs, worker-support projects, and workforce development and other activities designed to grow and expand the clean manufacturing sector in communities across Washington state. The legislature further intends to establish an environmental justice and equity advisory panel to provide recommendations for the development and implementation of the program, the distribution of funds, and the establishment of programs, activities, and projects to achieve environmental justice and environmental health goals. The legislature further intends to create and adopt community engagement plans and tribal consultation frameworks in the administration of the program to ensure equitable practices for meaningful community and federally recognized tribal involvement. Finally, the legislature intends to establish this program to contribute to a healthy environment for all of Washington's communities.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In order to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced consistent with the limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, the department must implement a cap on greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities and a program to track, verify, and enforce compliance through the use of compliance instruments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program must consist of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Annual allowance budgets that limit emissions from covered entities, as provided in this section and sections 8 and 9 of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining those entities covered by the program, and those entities that may voluntarily opt into coverage under the program, as provided in this section and sections 8 and 9 of this act;</p>

<li>
<p>Providing for offset credits as a method for meeting a compliance obligation, pursuant to section 18 of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining the compliance obligation for covered entities, as provided in section 20 of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing the authority of the department to enforce the program requirements, as provided in section 21 of this act;</p>

<p>Creating, in section 5 of this act, an environmental justice and equity advisory panel to monitor impacts of this policy on overburdened communities, advise on achieving positive workforce and job outcomes, and the equitable distribution of benefits to overburdened communities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a price ceiling and associated mechanisms in section 17 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall consider opportunities to implement the program in a manner that allows linking the state's program with other jurisdictions having similar programs, considering if such linkage will provide for a more cost-effective means for Washington covered entities to meet their compliance obligations while recognizing the special characteristics of the state's economy, communities, and industries. The department is authorized to enter into a linkage agreement with another jurisdiction after formal notice and opportunity for a public hearing, and when consistent with the requirements of section 22 of this act.</p>

<p>The department shall commence the program by January 1, 2023, by determining an emissions baseline establishing the proportionate share that the total greenhouse gas emissions of covered entities for the first compliance period bears to the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the state during 2015 through 2019, based on data reported to the department under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter. By October 1, 2022, the department shall adopt a program budget of allowances for the first compliance period of the program, calendar years 2023 through 2026, to be distributed from January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2026. If the first compliance period is delayed pursuant to section 20(7) of this act, the department shall adjust the program budget to reflect a shorter first compliance period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By October 1, 2026, the department shall add to its emissions baseline by incorporating the proportionate share that the total greenhouse gas emissions of new covered entities in the second compliance period bear to the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the state during 2023 through 2025. In determining the addition to the baseline, the department may exclude a year from the determination if the department identifies that year to have been an outlier due to a state of emergency. The department shall adopt a program budget of allowances for the second compliance period of the program, calendar years 2027 through 2030, that will be incorporated into the program budget of allowances for the first compliance period of the program to be distributed from January 1, 2027, through December 31, 2030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By October 1, 2028, the department shall adopt by rule the annual program budgets of allowances for the calendar years 2031 through 2040.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program budgets must be set to achieve the share of reductions by covered entities necessary to achieve the 2030, 2040, and 2050 statewide emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, based on data reported to the department under chapter 70A.15 RCW or provided as required by this chapter. The department must adopt annual allowance budgets for the program on a calendar year basis that provide for substantially equivalent reductions on an absolute basis for each year. An allowance distributed under the program, either directly by the department under sections 12 through 14 of this act or though auctions under section 11 of this act, does not expire and may be held or banked consistent with sections 11(6) and 16(1) of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must complete an evaluation by December 31, 2027, and by December 31, 2035, of the performance of the program, including its performance in reducing greenhouse gases. If the evaluation shows that adjustments to the annual budgets are necessary to ensure achievement of 2030 and 2040 emission reduction limits identified in RCW 70A.45.020, the department shall adjust the annual budgets accordingly. The department must complete additional evaluations by December 31, 2040, and by December 31, 2045, of the performance of the program, and make adjustments in the annual budgets to ensure achievement of 2050 emission reduction limits identified in RCW 70A.45.020. Nothing in this subsection precludes the department from making additional adjustments as necessary to ensure successful achievement of emission reduction limits. The department shall determine and make public the circumstances, metrics, and processes that would initiate the public consideration of additional program adjustments to ensure successful achievement of the emission reduction limits.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>When a covered entity reports, during a compliance period, emissions from a facility under RCW 70A.15.2200 that are below the thresholds specified in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the covered entity continues to have a compliance obligation through the current compliance period. When a covered entity reports emissions below the threshold during an entire compliance period, or has ceased all processes at the facility requiring reporting under RCW 70A.15.2200, the entity is no longer a covered entity unless the department provides notice at least 12 months before the end of the compliance period that the facility's emissions were within 10 percent of the threshold and that the person will continue to be designated as a covered entity in order to ensure equity among all covered entities. Whenever a covered entity ceases to be a covered entity, the department shall notify the legislature of the name of the entity and the reason the entity is no longer a covered entity.</p>

<p>By July 1, 2022, the department must adopt by rule objective criteria for both emissions' intensity and trade exposure for the purpose of identifying emissions-intensive, trade-exposed manufacturing businesses during the second compliance period of the program and subsequent compliance periods. A facility covered by subsection (1)(a) through (m) of this section is considered an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility and is eligible for allocation of no cost allowances as described in this section. In addition, any covered party that is a manufacturing business that can demonstrate to the department that it meets this criteria, is also eligible for treatment as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed and is eligible for allocation of no cost allowances as described in this section.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For all compliance periods prior to December 31, 2034, the annual allocation of allowances for direct distribution to a facility identified as emissions-intensive and trade-exposed must be equal to the facility's proportional obligation of the program budget under section 8 of this act, multiplied by 100 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall by rule provide for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed facilities to apply and receive from the department an adjustment to the allocation for direct distribution of allowances based on a facility-specific carbon intensity benchmark as calculated in this subsection. If the department determines that the net quantity of no cost allowances awarded pursuant to (a) of this subsection is lower than when using the facility-specific carbon intensity benchmark, the department shall award additional no cost allowances up to the quantity of allowances resulting from using the facility-specific carbon intensity benchmark. The department shall adjust the no cost allocation of allowances and credits to an emissions-intensive and trade-exposed facility to avoid duplication with any no cost allowances transferred pursuant to sections 13 and 14 of this act, if applicable.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For the purpose of this section, &quot;carbon intensity&quot; means the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from a facility in metric tons divided by the facility specific measure of production including, but not limited to, units of product manufactured or sold, over the same time interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an emissions-intensive and trade-exposed facility is not able to feasibly determine a carbon intensity benchmark based on its unique circumstances, the entity may elect to use a mass-based baseline that does not vary based on changes in production volumes. For each year during the first four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2023, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 100 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. For each year during the second four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2027, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 97 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. For each year during the third compliance period that begins January 1, 2031, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 94 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. Except as provided in (b)(iii) of this subsection, if a facility elects to use a mass-based baseline, it may not later convert to a carbon intensity benchmark during the first three compliance periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A facility with a North American industry classification system code beginning with 3364 that is utilizing a mass-based baseline in (b)(ii) of this subsection must receive an additional no cost allowance allocation under this section in order to accommodate an increase in production that increases its emissions above the baseline on a basis equivalent in principle to those awarded to entities utilizing a carbon intensity benchmark pursuant to this subsection (3)(b). The department shall establish methods to award, for any annual period, additional no cost allowance allocations under this section and, if appropriate based on projected production, to achieve a similar ongoing result through the adjustment of the facility's mass-based baseline. An eligible facility under this subsection that has elected to use a mass-based baseline may not convert to a carbon intensity benchmark until the next compliance period.</p>

<p>By July 31, 2022, the work group shall establish procedures for calculating carbon intensity benchmarks. The carbon intensity benchmark must be based upon data from 2015-2019, unless the emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility can demonstrate that there have been abnormal periods of operation that materially impacted the facility and the baseline period should be expanded to include years prior to 2015.</p>

<li>Prior to the beginning of either the second or third compliance periods, an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility may make an upward adjustment in the next compliance period's benchmark based on a demonstration that additional reductions in carbon intensity or mass emissions are not technically or economically feasible. An emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility may base its upward adjustment in the next compliance period on the facility's best available technology analysis. The department shall by rule provide for emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facilities to apply to the department for an adjustment to the allocation for direct distribution of no cost allowances based on its facility-specific carbon intensity benchmark or mass emissions baseline. The department shall make adjustments based on:</li>

<p>(A) A significant change in the emissions use or emissions attributable to the manufacture of an individual good or goods in this state by an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility based on a finding by the department that an adjustment is necessary to accommodate for changes in the manufacturing process that have a material impact on emissions;</p>
<p>(B) Significant changes to an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility's external competitive environment that result in a significant increase in leakage risk; or</p>
<p>(C) Abnormal operating periods when an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility's carbon intensity has been materially affected so that these abnormal operating periods are either excluded or otherwise considered in the establishment of the compliance period carbon intensity benchmarks.</p>
<pre><code>    ii.

The annual allocation must decline from the average of the facility's annual allocation of no cost allowances from 2031-2034. If the emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility can demonstrate that there have been abnormal periods of operation that materially impacted the facility, then the baseline period should be expanded to include years prior to 2031. The department shall provide a recommendation to the legislature for the adoption of an annual allocation for a covered facility for its process emissions, separate from emissions associated with energy or heat production, based on a best available technology limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2030, the department shall provide a report to the appropriate committees of the senate and house of representatives that describes alternative methods for determining the amount and a schedule of allowances to be provided to facilities owned or operated by each covered entity designated as an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed manufacturing business. The report must include a review of global best practices in ensuring against emissions leakage and economic harm to businesses in carbon pricing programs and describe alternative methods of emissions performance benchmarking and mass-based allocation of no cost allowances. In developing the report, the department shall form an advisory group that includes representatives of the manufacturers listed in subsection (1) of this section.</p>

<p>If the actual emissions of an emissions-intensive, trade- exposed facility exceed the facility's no cost allowances assigned for that compliance period, it must acquire additional compliance instruments such that the total compliance instruments transferred to its compliance account consistent with section 20 of this act equals emissions during the compliance period. The department shall limit the use of offset credits for compliance by an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility, such that the quantity of no cost allowances plus the provision of offset credits does not exceed 100 percent of the facility's total compliance obligation over a compliance period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must withhold or withdraw the relevant share of allowances allocated to a covered entity under this section in the event that the covered entity ceases production in the state and becomes a closed facility. In the event an entity curtails all production becoming a curtailed facility, the allowances are retained but cannot be traded, sold, or transferred and are still subject to prescribed emission reductions had the facility not curtailed. An operator of a curtailed facility may transfer the allowances to a new operator of the facility that will be operated under the same North American industry classification system codes. If the curtailed facility becomes a closed facility, then all unused allowances will be transferred to the emissions containment reserve. A curtailed facility is not eligible to receive free allowances during a period of curtailment.
