<p>All claims against the state, or against the state's officers, employees, or volunteers, acting in such capacity, for damages, must be presented to the office of risk management within one year of the breach.

<p>The state digital data breach account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. Revenues to the account consist of legislative appropriations and transfers and other revenues provided by law. If the office of the attorney general brings an action in the name of the state or on behalf of its residents under chapter 19.86 RCW or other law for injuries suffered from a breach of the security of the system owned or operated by the state, any damages, restitution, or penalties received from such an action must be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may only be used for the payment of eligible claims provided in section 1 of this act. Only the director or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>
