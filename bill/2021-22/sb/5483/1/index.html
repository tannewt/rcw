The legislature finds that the appropriation of funds from the NOVA account during the 2009-2011 fiscal biennium for maintenance and operation of state parks or to improve accessibility for boaters and off-road vehicle users at state parks will benefit boaters and off-road vehicle users and others who use nonhighway and nonmotorized recreational facilities.

<ol>
<li>
<p>A statewide annual special transportation benefit assessment is imposed on developed parcels for the purposes of mitigating the impacts of growth on state transportation infrastructure throughout the state. The amount of the transportation benefit assessment is the increase in assessed value for the parcel resulting from new construction multiplied by the applicable rate:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For residential developed parcels the rate is $1.50 per $1,000 of assessed value resulting from new construction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For manufacturing developed parcels the rate is one dollar per $1,000 of assessed value resulting from new construction; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all other developed parcels not otherwise described in (a) or (b) of this subsection (1), the rate is $3 per $1,000 of assessed value resulting from new construction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parcels that are classified as designated forestland under chapter 84.33 RCW or designated agriculture land or timberland under chapter 84.34 RCW are exempt from the transportation benefit assessment imposed in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To determine the appropriate designation of the parcel for purposes of applying the rate under subsection (1) of this section, county assessors may use land use codes or data collected from parcel investigations, or both, obtained in their normal course of business with respect to administering property taxes. The amount of the transportation benefit assessment constitutes a lien against the property. The assessment is subject to the same provisions as those for property tax collections, as provided in RCW 84.56.020 and must be collected by the county treasurer under the authority in RCW 84.56.035. The transportation benefit assessment fee must be collected concurrently with property taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2023 and thereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All revenues generated under this section must be transferred to the state treasurer to be deposited into the forward flexible account created in section 802 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Developed parcel&quot; means any parcel altered from the natural state by the construction, creation, or addition of structures or other impervious surfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Land use code&quot; means restrictions on the type of development for a specific parcel of land as identified by records maintained by the assessor or supplemented by information resulting from investigation and generally conforming with the department of revenue's two-digit land use codes in WAC 458-53-030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Manufacturing developed parcel&quot; means any developed parcel used for manufacturing purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Parcel&quot; means the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an identified owner, boundaries, and surface area that is documented for property tax purposes and given a tax lot number by the assessor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Residence&quot; means a building or structure or portion thereof, designed for and used to provide a place of abode for human beings. &quot;Residence&quot; includes &quot;residential&quot; or &quot;residential unit&quot; as referring to the type of or intended use of a building or structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Residential parcel&quot; means any developed parcel that contains no more than four residences or four residential units within a single structure and used primarily for residential purposes.</p>

<p>Unless these powers are otherwise delegated by the legislature, the transportation commission is the tolling authority for the state. The tolling authority shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Set toll rates, (ii) establish appropriate exemptions, if any, <strong>except as provided otherwise in this section,</strong> and (iii) make adjustments as conditions warrant on eligible toll facilities;</li>

<p>Review toll collection policies, toll operations policies, and toll revenue expenditures on the eligible toll facilities and report annually on this review to the legislature.</p>

<p>The tolling authority, in determining toll rates, shall consider the policy guidelines established in RCW 47.56.830.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise directed by the legislature, in setting and periodically adjusting toll rates, the tolling authority must ensure that toll rates will generate revenue sufficient to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Meet the operating costs of the eligible toll facilities, including necessary maintenance, preservation, renewal, replacement, administration, and toll enforcement by public law enforcement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet obligations for the timely payment of debt service on bonds issued for eligible toll facilities, and any other associated financing costs including, but not limited to, required reserves, minimum debt coverage or other appropriate contingency funding, insurance, and compliance with all other financial and other covenants made by the state in the bond proceedings;</p>

<p>The legislature pledges to appropriate toll revenue as necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. When the legislature has specifically identified and designated an eligible toll facility and authorized the issuance of bonds for the financing of the eligible toll facility that are payable from and secured by a pledge of toll revenue, the legislature further agrees for the benefit of the owners of outstanding bonds issued by the state for eligible toll facilities to continue in effect and not to impair or withdraw the authorization of the tolling authority to fix and adjust tolls as provided in this section.
