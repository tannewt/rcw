<p>Job order contracts shall be awarded through a competitive process using public requests for proposals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public body shall <strong>prioritize efforts</strong> to solicit proposals from certified minority or certified woman-owned contractors to the extent permitted by the Washington state civil rights act, RCW 49.60.400.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public body shall publish, at least once in a statewide publication and legal newspaper of general circulation published in every county in which the public works project is anticipated, a request for proposals for job order contracts and the availability and location of the request for proposal documents. <strong>The public body is encouraged to post the request for proposals for job order contracts and the availability and location of the request for proposal documents in other areas, such as websites for business associations, the office of minority and women's business enterprises, and other locations and mediums that will further publicize the opportunities.</strong> The public body shall ensure that the request for proposal documents at a minimum includes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A detailed description of the scope of the job order contract including performance, technical requirements and specifications, functional and operational elements, minimum and maximum work order amounts, duration of the contract, and options to extend the job order contract;</p>

<p>A description of the process the public body will use to evaluate qualifications and proposals, including evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors. The public body shall ensure that evaluation factors include, but are not limited to, <strong>the coefficient</strong> and the ability of the proposer to perform the job order contract. In evaluating the ability of the proposer to perform the job order contract, the public body may consider: The ability of the professional personnel who will work on the job order contract; past performance on similar contracts; ability to meet time and budget requirements; past performance on approved subcontractor inclusion plans; ability to provide a performance and payment bond for the job order contract; recent, current, and projected workloads of the proposer; location; and the concept of the proposal;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A public body shall establish a committee**, including a member with knowledge and experience in state and federal laws, rules, and best practices concerning public contracting for minority, women, and veteran-owned businesses and small businesses,** to evaluate the proposals. After the committee has selected the most qualified finalists, the finalists shall submit <strong>a sealed bid including, but not limited to, coefficient(s)</strong>. Such bids may be in the form of coefficient <strong>adjustments to the</strong> listed <strong>unit</strong> price book . The public body shall award the contract to the firm submitting the highest scored final proposal using the evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors published in the public request for proposals and will notify the board of the award of the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public body shall provide a protest period of at least ten business days following the day of the announcement of the apparent successful proposal to allow a protester to file a detailed statement of the grounds of the protest. The public body shall promptly make a determination on the merits of the protest and provide to all proposers a written decision of denial or acceptance of the protest. The public body shall not execute the contract until two business days following the public body's decision on the protest.</p>

<p>The maximum total dollar amount that may be awarded under a job order contract is <strong>$4,000,000</strong> per year for a maximum of three years. Any unused capacity from the previous year may be carried over for one year and added to the immediate following year's limit. The maximum annual volume including unused capacity shall not exceed the limit of two years. The maximum total dollar amount that may be awarded under a job order contract for the department of enterprise services, counties with a population of more than <strong>1,000,000</strong>, and cities with a population of more than <strong>400,000</strong> is <strong>$6,000,000</strong> per year for a maximum of three years. The maximum total dollar amounts are exclusive of Washington state sales and use tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job order contracts may be executed for an initial contract term of not to exceed two years, with the option of extending or renewing the job order contract for one year. All extensions or renewals must be priced as provided in the request for proposals. The extension or renewal must be mutually agreed to by the public body and the job order contractor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public body may have no more than three job order contracts in effect at any one time, with the exception of the department of enterprise services, which may have six job order contracts in effect at any one time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least <strong>90</strong> percent of work contained in a job order contract must be subcontracted to entities other than the job order contractor. The job order contractor must distribute contracts as equitably as possible among qualified and available subcontractors including certified minority and woman-owned subcontractors to the extent permitted by law as demonstrated on the subcontractor and supplier project submission, and shall limit subcontractor bonding requirements to the greatest extent possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The job order contractor shall publish notification of intent to perform public works projects at the beginning of each contract year in a statewide publication and in a legal newspaper of general circulation in every county in which the public works projects are anticipated. <strong>The job order contractor is encouraged to post the notification of intent to perform public works projects in other areas, such as websites for business associations, the office of minority and women's business enterprises, and other locations and mediums that will further publicize subcontractor opportunities.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job order contractors shall pay prevailing wages for all work that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of chapter 39.12 RCW. Prevailing wages for all work performed pursuant to each work order must be the rates in effect at the time the individual work order is issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, in the initial contract term, the public body, at no fault of the job order contractor, fails to issue the minimum amount of work orders stated in the public request for proposals, the public body shall pay the contractor an amount equal to the difference between the minimum work order amount and the actual total of the work orders issued multiplied by an appropriate percentage for overhead and profit contained in the contract award coefficient for services as specified in the request for proposals. This is the contractor's sole remedy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All job order contracts awarded under this section must be signed before July 1, <strong>2031</strong>; however the job order contract may be extended or renewed as provided for in this section.</p>

<p>In addition to the general contractor/construction manager requirements established in this chapter, public bodies utilizing the general contractor/construction manager method for a heavy civil construction project must also comply with the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The heavy civil construction general contractor/construction manager contract solicitation must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide the reasons for using the general contractor/construction manager procedure, including a clear statement that the public body is electing to procure the project as a heavy civil construction project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicate the minimum percentage of the cost of the work to construct the project that will constitute the negotiated self-perform portion of the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indicate whether the public body will allow the price to be paid for the negotiated self-perform portion of the project to be deemed a cost of the work to which the general contractor/construction manager's percent fee applies; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require proposals to indicate the proposer's fee for the negotiated self-perform portion of the project;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of the negotiation of the maximum allowable construction cost established in RCW 39.10.370(1), the general contractor/construction manager shall submit a proposed construction management and contracting plan, which must include, at a minimum:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The public body and general contractor/construction manager may negotiate the scopes of work to be procured by bid and the price and scope of work for the negotiated self-perform portion of the project, if any;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The negotiated self-perform portion of the project must not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the work to construct the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, for a project that a public body has elected to procure as a heavy civil construction project under this chapter, at least 30 percent of the cost of the work to construct the project included in the negotiated maximum allowable construction cost must be procured through competitive sealed bidding in which bidding by the general contractor/construction manager or its subsidiaries is prohibited;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the limitation of subsection (5) of this section, the public body may additionally negotiate with the general contractor/construction manager to determine on which scopes of work the general contractor/construction manager will be permitted to bid, if any;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public body and general contractor/construction manager shall negotiate, to the public body's satisfaction, a fair and reasonable inclusion plan;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For a project procured as a heavy civil construction project, an independent audit, paid for by the public body, must be conducted to confirm the proper accrual of costs as outlined in the contract. The public body shall define the scope of the audit in the contract.</p>

<p>The capital projects advisory review board shall coordinate and consult with the office of minority and women's business enterprises, the department of enterprise services, the office of equity, community stakeholders and advocates, and subject matter experts to create best practices guidelines for increasing and sustaining access to contracting opportunities in alternative public works for minority, women, and veteran-owned businesses, and small businesses. In creating the guidelines, the board shall take into consideration the barriers to participation identified in the local government contracting report produced pursuant to section 16, chapter 434, Laws of 2019, information and recommendations from the 2019 Washington state disparity study and disparity studies of any other public body in Washington state, and successful diversity and inclusion policies being implemented by state and local governmental agencies. The best practices shall address, at a minimum, guidelines for use of race-neutral and race-conscious programs, elements of successful inclusion plans, the use of aspirational inclusion goals, evaluation of inclusion plans in the contract award process, and the evaluation of inclusion plans and past performance in public body certification and project approval processes under RCW 39.10.270 and 39.10.280. The board shall make the best practices guidelines available on its website by June 30, 2022, and should have a plan to update the practices to keep them relevant for use.
