<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the word &quot;board&quot; be read to mean both the school employees' benefits board and the public employees' benefits board throughout this chapter. The use of &quot;board&quot; should be liberally construed to mean both boards, to the extent not in conflict with state or federal law. In no case shall either board be limited from exercising its individual authority as authorized within this chapter.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that (a) the state is a major purchaser of health care services, (b) the increasing costs of such health care services are posing and will continue to pose a great financial burden on the state, (c) it is the state's policy, consistent with the best interests of the state, to provide comprehensive health care as an employer, to employees and school employees, officials, their dependents, and to those who are dependent on the state for necessary medical care, and (d) it is imperative that the state begin to develop effective and efficient health care delivery systems and strategies for procuring health care services in order for the state to continue to purchase the most comprehensive health care possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish the Washington state health care authority whose purpose shall be to (a) develop health care benefit programs that provide access to at least one comprehensive benefit plan funded to the fullest extent possible by the employer, and a health savings account/high deductible health plan option as defined in section 1201 of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003, as amended, for eligible employees and school employees, officials, and their dependents, and (b) study all state purchased health care, alternative health care delivery systems, and strategies for the procurement of health care services and make recommendations aimed at minimizing the financial burden which health care poses on the state, employees and school employees, and its charges, while at the same time allowing the state to provide the most comprehensive health care options possible.</p>

<p>On and after January 1, 2020, health benefits for groups of school employees of school employees' benefits board organizations shall be merged into a single, community-rated risk pool separate and distinct from the pool described in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 15, 2018, the health care authority, in consultation with the board, shall submit to the appropriate committees of the legislature a complete analysis of the most appropriate risk pool for the retired and disabled school employees, to include at a minimum an analysis of the size of the nonmedicare and medicare retiree enrollment pools, the impacts on cost for state and school district retirees of moving retirees from one pool to another, the need for and the amount of an ongoing retiree subsidy allocation from the active school employees, and the timing and suggested approach for a transition from one risk pool to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a minimum, and regardless of other legislative enactments, the state health services purchasing agent shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Require that a public agency that provides subsidies for a substantial portion of services now covered under the basic health plan use uniform eligibility processes, insofar as may be possible, and ensure that multiple eligibility determinations are not required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require that a health care provider or a health care facility that receives funds from a public program provide care to state residents receiving a state subsidy who may wish to receive care from them, and that an insuring entity that receives funds from a public program accept enrollment from state residents receiving a state subsidy who may wish to enroll with them;</p>

<li>
<p>Strive to integrate purchasing for all publicly sponsored health services in order to maximize the cost control potential and promote the most efficient methods of financing and coordinating services;</p>

<li>
<p>Consult regularly with the governor, the legislature, and state agency directors whose operations are affected by the implementation of this section; and</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that there is growing evidence that, for preference-sensitive care involving elective surgery, patient-practitioner communication is improved through the use of high quality decision aids that detail the benefits, harms, and uncertainty of available treatment options. Improved communication leads to more fully informed patient decisions. The legislature intends to increase the extent to which patients make genuinely informed, preference-based treatment decisions, by promoting public/private collaborative efforts to broaden the development, certification, use, and evaluation of effective decision aids and by recognition of shared decision making and patient decision aids in the state's laws on informed consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The health care authority shall implement a shared decision-making demonstration project. The demonstration project shall be conducted at one or more multispecialty group practice sites providing state purchased health care in the state of Washington, and may include other practice sites providing state purchased health care. The demonstration project shall include the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Incorporation into clinical practice of one or more decision aids for one or more identified preference-sensitive care areas combined with ongoing training and support of involved practitioners and practice teams, preferably at sites with necessary supportive health information technology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An evaluation of the impact of the use of shared decision making with decision aids, including the use of preference-sensitive health care services selected for the demonstration project and expenditures for those services, the impact on patients, including patient understanding of the treatment options presented and concordance between patient values and the care received, and patient and practitioner satisfaction with the shared decision-making process; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a condition of participating in the demonstration project, a participating practice site must bear the cost of selecting, purchasing, and incorporating the chosen decision aids into clinical practice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The health care authority may solicit and accept funding and in-kind contributions to support the demonstration and evaluation, and may scale the evaluation to fall within resulting resource parameters.</p>

However, liability insurance shall not be made available to dependents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public employees' benefits board shall develop employee benefit plans that include comprehensive health care benefits for employees. In developing these plans, the public employees' benefits board shall consider the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Methods of maximizing cost containment while ensuring access to quality health care;</p>

<p>Effective coordination of benefits; and</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To maintain the comprehensive nature of employee health care benefits, benefits provided to employees shall be substantially equivalent to the state employees' health benefit plan in effect on January 1, 1993. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit changes or increases in employee point-of-service payments or employee premium payments for benefits or the administration of a high deductible health plan in conjunction with a health savings account.

<p>Except if bargained for under chapter 41.80 RCW, the public employees' benefits board shall design benefits and determine the terms and conditions of employee and retired or disabled school employee participation and coverage, including establishment of eligibility criteria subject to the requirements of this chapter. Employer groups obtaining benefits through contractual agreement with the authority for employees defined in RCW 41.05.011(6)(a) (i) through (vi) may contractually agree with the authority to benefits eligibility criteria which differs from that determined by the public employees' benefits board. The eligibility criteria established by the public employees' benefits board shall be no more restrictive than the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b) through (e) of this subsection, an employee is eligible for benefits from the date of employment if the employing agency anticipates he or she will work an average of at least eighty hours per month and for at least eight hours in each month for more than six consecutive months. An employee determined ineligible for benefits at the beginning of his or her employment shall become eligible in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>An employee who works an average of at least eighty hours per month and for at least eight hours in each month and whose anticipated duration of employment is revised from less than or equal to six consecutive months to more than six consecutive months becomes eligible when the revision is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee who works an average of at least eighty hours per month over a period of six consecutive months and for at least eight hours in each of those six consecutive months becomes eligible at the first of the month following the six-month averaging period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A seasonal employee is eligible for benefits from the date of employment if the employing agency anticipates that he or she will work an average of at least eighty hours per month and for at least eight hours in each month of the season. A seasonal employee determined ineligible at the beginning of his or her employment who works an average of at least eighty hours per month over a period of six consecutive months and at least eight hours in each of those six consecutive months becomes eligible at the first of the month following the six-month averaging period. A benefits-eligible seasonal employee who works a season of less than nine months shall not be eligible for the employer contribution during the off season, but may continue enrollment in benefits during the off season by self-paying for the benefits. A benefits-eligible seasonal employee who works a season of nine months or more is eligible for the employer contribution through the off season following each season worked.</p>

<p>Faculty who the employing agency anticipates will work half–time or more for the entire instructional year or equivalent nine-month period are eligible for benefits from the date of employment. Eligibility shall continue until the beginning of the first full month of the next instructional year, unless the employment relationship is terminated, in which case eligibility shall cease the first month following the notice of termination or the effective date of the termination, whichever is later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty who the employing agency anticipates will not work for the entire instructional year or equivalent nine-month period are eligible for benefits at the beginning of the second consecutive quarter or semester of employment in which he or she is anticipated to work, or has actually worked, half-time or more. Such an employee shall continue to receive uninterrupted employer contributions for benefits if the employee works at least half-time in a quarter or semester. Faculty who the employing agency anticipates will not work for the entire instructional year or equivalent nine-month period, but who actually work half-time or more throughout the entire instructional year, are eligible for summer or off-quarter or off-semester coverage. Faculty who have met the criteria of this subsection (4)(c)(ii), who work at least two quarters or two semesters of the academic year with an average academic year workload of half-time or more for three quarters or two semesters of the academic year, and who have worked an average of half-time or more in each of the two preceding academic years shall continue to receive uninterrupted employer contributions for benefits if he or she works at least half-time in a quarter or semester or works two quarters or two semesters of the academic year with an average academic workload each academic year of half-time or more for three quarters or two semesters. Eligibility under this section ceases immediately if this criteria is not met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty may establish or maintain eligibility for benefits by working for more than one institution of higher education. When faculty work for more than one institution of higher education, those institutions shall prorate the employer contribution costs, or if eligibility is reached through one institution, that institution will pay the full employer contribution. Faculty working for more than one institution must alert his or her employers to his or her potential eligibility in order to establish eligibility.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Eligibility for an employee whose work circumstances are described by more than one of the eligibility categories in (a) through (e) of this subsection shall be determined solely by the criteria of the category that most closely describes the employee's work circumstances.</p>

<p>Except for an employee eligible for benefits under (b) or (c)(ii) of this subsection, an employee who has established eligibility for benefits under this section shall remain eligible for benefits each month in which he or she is in pay status for eight or more hours, if (i) he or she remains in a benefits-eligible position and (ii) leave from the benefits-eligible position is approved by the employing agency. A benefits-eligible seasonal employee is eligible for the employer contribution in any month of his or her season in which he or she is in pay status eight or more hours during that month. Eligibility ends if these conditions are not met, the employment relationship is terminated, or the employee voluntarily transfers to a noneligible position.</p>

It must also examine the income levels of public option plan enrollees over time. The analysis may examine a sample of hospitals of various sizes and located in various counties. In conducting its analysis, the exchange must give substantial weight to any available reporting of health care provider and health system costs under RCW 70.390.050;</p>

<p>Members of the committee must include representation from state agencies, small and large employers, health plans, patient groups, federally recognized tribes, consumers, academic experts on health care measurement, hospitals, physicians, and other providers. The governor shall appoint the members of the committee, except that a statewide association representing hospitals may appoint a member representing hospitals, and a statewide association representing physicians may appoint a member representing physicians. The governor shall ensure that members represent diverse geographic locations and both rural and urban communities. The chief executive officer of the lead organization must also serve on the committee. The committee must be chaired by the director of the authority.</p>
</li>

However, liability insurance should not be made available to dependents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop school employee benefit plans that include comprehensive, evidence-based health care benefits for school employees. In developing these plans, the school employees' benefits board shall consider the following elements:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Methods of maximizing cost containment while ensuring access to quality health care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of provider arrangements that encourage cost containment and ensure access to quality care including, but not limited to, prepaid delivery systems and prospective payment methods;</p>

<li>
<p>Authorize premium contributions for a school employee and the employee's dependents in a manner that encourages the use of cost-efficient health care systems. For participating school employees, the required school employee share of the cost for family coverage premiums may not exceed three times the premiums for a school employee purchasing single coverage for the same coverage plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the terms and conditions of school employee and dependent eligibility criteria, enrollment policies, and scope of coverage. At a minimum, the eligibility criteria established by the school employees' benefits board shall address the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The effective date of coverage following hire;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish terms and conditions for a school employees' benefits board organization to have the ability to locally negotiate eligibility criteria for a school employee who is anticipated to work less than six hundred thirty hours in a school year. A school employees' benefits board organization that elects to use a lower threshold of hours for benefits eligibility must use benefits authorized by the school employees' benefits board and shall do so as an enrichment to the state's definition of basic education;</p>

<li>
<p>Establish penalties to be imposed when a school employees' benefits board organization fails to comply with established participation criteria; and</p>
