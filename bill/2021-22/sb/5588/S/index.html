<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Incarcerated individuals who are sentenced to life without the possibility of release or sentenced to death under chapter 10.95 RCW; and</p>

<p>Incarcerated individuals who are subject to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual reentry plan may be one document, or may be a series of individual plans that combine to meet the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing individual reentry plans, the department shall assess all incarcerated individuals using standardized and comprehensive tools to identify the criminogenic risks, programmatic needs, and educational and vocational skill levels for each incarcerated individual. The assessment tool should take into account demographic biases, such as culture, age, and gender, as well as the needs of the incarcerated individual, including any learning disabilities, substance abuse or mental health issues, and social or behavior challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>The initial assessment shall be conducted as early as sentencing, but, whenever possible, no later than forty‑five days of being sentenced to the jurisdiction of the department of corrections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan shall be developed as soon as possible after the initial assessment is conducted, but, whenever possible, no later than sixty days after completion of the assessment, and shall be periodically reviewed and updated as appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual reentry plan shall, at a minimum, include:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>A plan to maintain contact with the incarcerated individual's children and family, if appropriate. The plan should determine whether parenting classes, or other services, are appropriate to facilitate successful reunification with the incarcerated individual's children and family;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individualized portfolio for each incarcerated individual that includes the incarcerated individual's education achievements, certifications, employment, work experience, skills, and any training received prior to and during incarceration; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A plan for the incarcerated individual during the period of incarceration through reentry into the community that addresses the needs of the incarcerated individual including education, employment, substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment, family reunification, and other areas which are needed to facilitate a successful reintegration into the community.</p>

<p>(C) **Prepare a 90-day supply of any necessary prescribed medications to be provided upon release, through a combination of a 30-day supply of in-hand medications and 60-day supply of prescriptions,**<strong>to ensure continuity of care and that medications are readily available for the incarcerated person upon release;</strong></p>
<p>(D) <strong>Connect the incarcerated individual with available housing, employment, and educational and job training opportunities in the area where the person will be residing upon release;</strong></p>
<p>(E) <strong>Provide for short-term basic needs such as clothing, food, and hygiene supplies; and</strong></p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In determining the county of discharge for an incarcerated individual released to community custody, the department may approve a residence location that is not in the incarcerated individual's county of origin if the department determines that the residence location would be appropriate based on any court-ordered condition of the incarcerated individual's sentence, victim safety concerns, and factors that increase opportunities for successful reentry and long-term support including, but not limited to, location of family or other sponsoring persons or organizations that will support the incarcerated individual, ability to complete an educational program that the incarcerated individual is enrolled in, availability of appropriate programming or treatment, and access to housing, employment, and prosocial influences on the person in the community.</p>

<li>
<p>If the incarcerated individual is a homeless person as defined in RCW 43.185C.010, or the incarcerated individual's residence is unknown, then the incarcerated individual's county of origin means the county of the incarcerated individual's first felony conviction in Washington state.</p>
