<p>On its own, <strong>on motion when a guardianship petition is filed under RCW 11.130.190,</strong> or on petition by a person interested in a minor's welfare, including the minor, the court may appoint an emergency guardian for the minor if the court finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent substantial harm to the minor's health, safety, or welfare; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No other person appears to have authority**, ability,** and <strong>the</strong> willingness to act <strong>to prevent substantial harm to the minor's health, safety, or welfare</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for a minor may not exceed sixty days and the emergency guardian may exercise only the powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency guardian's authority may be extended once for not more than sixty days if the court finds that the conditions for appointment of an emergency guardian in subsection (1) of this section continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of a hearing on <strong>a motion for or</strong> a petition for appointment of an emergency guardian for a minor must be given to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The minor, if the minor is twelve years of age or older;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any attorney appointed under RCW 11.130.200;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each parent of the minor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person, other than a parent, having care or custody of the minor; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other person the court determines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may appoint an emergency guardian for a minor without notice under subsection (3) of this section and a hearing only if the court finds from an affidavit or testimony that the minor's health, safety, or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency guardian without notice to an unrepresented minor or the attorney for a represented minor, notice of the appointment must be given not later than forty-eight hours after the appointment to the individuals listed in subsection (3) of this section. Not later than five days after the appointment, the court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section, with or without notice, is not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under RCW 11.130.185.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court requires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the court may extend an emergency guardianship pending the outcome of a full hearing under RCW 11.130.190 or 11.130.220.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a petition for guardianship under RCW 11.130.215 is pending, or is subsequently filed after a petition under this section, the cases shall be linked or consolidated.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Relating to children alleged or found to be dependent as provided in chapter 26.44 RCW and in RCW 13.34.030 through 13.34.161;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>To approve or disapprove out-of-home placement as provided in RCW 13.32A.170;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relating to juveniles alleged or found to have committed offenses, traffic or civil infractions, or violations as provided in RCW 13.40.020 through 13.40.230, unless:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The juvenile court transfers jurisdiction of a particular juvenile to adult criminal court pursuant to RCW 13.40.110;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statute of limitations applicable to adult prosecution for the offense, traffic or civil infraction, or violation has expired;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alleged offense or infraction is a traffic, fish, boating, or game offense, or traffic or civil infraction committed by a juvenile sixteen years of age or older and would, if committed by an adult, be tried or heard in a court of limited jurisdiction, in which instance the appropriate court of limited jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction over the alleged offense or infraction, and no guardian ad litem is required in any such proceeding due to the juvenile's age. If such an alleged offense or infraction and an alleged offense or infraction subject to juvenile court jurisdiction arise out of the same event or incident, the juvenile court may have jurisdiction of both matters. The jurisdiction under this subsection does not constitute &quot;transfer&quot; or a &quot;decline&quot; for purposes of RCW 13.40.110 (1) or (2) or (e)(i) of this subsection. Courts of limited jurisdiction which confine juveniles for an alleged offense or infraction may place juveniles in juvenile detention facilities under an agreement with the officials responsible for the administration of the juvenile detention facility in RCW 13.04.035 and 13.20.060;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alleged offense is a traffic or civil infraction, a violation of compulsory school attendance provisions under chapter 28A.225 RCW, or a misdemeanor, and a court of limited jurisdiction has assumed concurrent jurisdiction over those offenses as provided in RCW 13.04.0301; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile is sixteen or seventeen years old on the date the alleged offense is committed and the alleged offense is:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) A serious violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030;</p>
<p>(B) A violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 and the juvenile has a criminal history consisting of: One or more prior serious violent offenses; two or more prior violent offenses; or three or more of any combination of the following offenses: Any class A felony, any class B felony, vehicular assault, or manslaughter in the second degree, all of which must have been committed after the juvenile's thirteenth birthday and prosecuted separately; or</p>
<p>(C) Rape of a child in the first degree.</p>
<p>(I) In such a case the adult criminal court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction, except as provided in (e)(v)(C)(II) and (III) of this subsection.</p>
<p>(II) The juvenile court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the disposition of any remaining charges in any case in which the juvenile is found not guilty in the adult criminal court of the charge or charges for which he or she was transferred, or is convicted in the adult criminal court of an offense that is not also an offense listed in (e)(v) of this subsection. The juvenile court shall maintain residual juvenile court jurisdiction up to age twenty-five if the juvenile has turned eighteen years of age during the adult criminal court proceedings but only for the purpose of returning a case to juvenile court for disposition pursuant to RCW 13.40.300(3)(d).</p>
<p>(III) The prosecutor and respondent may agree to juvenile court jurisdiction and waive application of exclusive adult criminal jurisdiction in (e)(v)(A) through (C) of this subsection and remove the proceeding back to juvenile court with the court's approval.</p>
<p>If the juvenile challenges the state's determination of the juvenile's criminal history under (e)(v) of this subsection, the state may establish the offender's criminal history by a preponderance of the evidence. If the criminal history consists of adjudications entered upon a plea of guilty, the state shall not bear a burden of establishing the knowing and voluntariness of the plea;</p>
<pre><code>f. Under the interstate compact on juveniles as provided in chapter 13.24 RCW;

g. Relating to termination of a diversion agreement under RCW 13.40.080, including a proceeding in which the divertee has attained eighteen years of age;

h. Relating to court validation of a voluntary consent to an out-of-home placement under chapter 13.34 RCW, by the parent or Indian custodian of an Indian child, except if the parent or Indian custodian and child are residents of or domiciled within the boundaries of a federally recognized Indian reservation over which the tribe exercises exclusive jurisdiction; and

i. Relating to petitions to compel disclosure of information filed by the department of social and health services pursuant to RCW 74.13.042.

<p>As used in this subsection and subsection (3) of this section, &quot;good cause not to require immediate income withholding&quot; means a written determination of why implementing immediate wage withholding would not be in the child's best interests and, in modification cases, proof of timely payment of previously ordered support.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In all other cases not under subsection (1) of this section, the court may order the person required to pay support to make payments directly to the person entitled to receive the payments, to the Washington state support registry, or may order that payments be made in accordance with an alternate arrangement agreed upon by the parties.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>(A) File a motion in the underlying superior court action; or</p>
<p>(B) If there is not already an underlying superior court action, initiate an action in the superior court.</p>
<p>As used in this subsection, &quot;good cause not to require immediate income withholding&quot; is any reason that the court finds appropriate.</p>
<pre><code>b. The superior court may order immediate or delayed income withholding as follows:

    i. Immediate income withholding may be ordered if the person required to pay support has earnings. If immediate income withholding is ordered under this subsection, all support payments shall be paid to the Washington state support registry. The superior court shall issue a mandatory wage assignment order as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW when the support order is signed by the court. The payee under the order or the person entitled to receive the transfer payment is responsible for serving the employer with the order and for its enforcement as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW.

    ii. If immediate income withholding is not ordered, the court shall require that income withholding be delayed until a payment is past due. The support order shall contain a statement that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits, and liens enforced against real and personal property under the child support statutes of this or any other state, without further notice to the person required to pay support, after a payment is past due.

<p>After a hearing under RCW 11.130.195, the court may appoint a guardian for a minor, if appointment is proper under RCW 11.130.185, dismiss the proceeding, or take other appropriate action consistent with this chapter or law of this state other than this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In appointing a guardian under subsection (1) of this section, the following rules apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The court shall appoint a person nominated as guardian by a parent of the minor in a <strong>probated</strong> will or other record unless the court finds the appointment is contrary to the best interest of the minor. <strong>Any &quot;other record&quot; must be a declaration or other sworn document and may include a power of attorney or other sworn statement as to the care, custody, or control of the minor child.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If multiple parents have nominated different persons to serve as guardian, the court shall appoint the nominee whose appointment is in the best interest of the minor, unless the court finds that appointment of none of the nominees is in the best interest of the minor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a guardian is not appointed under (a) or (b) of this subsection, the court shall appoint the person nominated by the minor if the minor is twelve years of age or older unless the court finds that appointment is contrary to the best interest of the minor. In that case, the court shall appoint as guardian a person whose appointment is in the best interest of the minor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the interest of maintaining or encouraging involvement by a minor's parent in the minor's life, developing self-reliance of the minor, or for other good cause, the court, at the time of appointment of a guardian for the minor or later, on its own or on motion of the minor or other interested person, may create a limited guardianship by limiting the powers otherwise granted by this article to the guardian. Following the same procedure, the court may grant additional powers or withdraw powers previously granted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court, as part of an order appointing a guardian for a minor, shall state rights retained by any parent of the minor, which shall preserve the parent-child relationship through an order for parent-child visitation and other contact, unless the court finds the relationship should be limited or restricted under RCW 26.09.191; and which may include decision making regarding the minor's health care, education, or other matter, or access to a record regarding the minor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order granting a guardianship for a minor must state that each parent of the minor is entitled to notice that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The guardian has delegated custody of the minor subject to guardianship;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court has modified or limited the powers of the guardian; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court has removed the guardian.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order granting a guardianship for a minor must identify any person in addition to a parent of the minor which is entitled to notice of the events listed in subsection (5) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order granting guardianship for a minor must direct the clerk of the court to issue letters of office to the guardian containing an expiration date which should be the minor's eighteenth birthday.</p>
