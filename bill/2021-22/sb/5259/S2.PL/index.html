<h2 id="section-1-1020">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1020">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that law enforcement transparency and accountability are vital in maintaining public trust. Data collection is one essential tool to allow the public, law enforcement, and policymakers to analyze the effectiveness of existing police practices, determine which policies and training work and do not work, and avoid unintended consequences by supporting policy decisions with clear and relevant data.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that creating a statewide data collection program that creates a publicly accessible database to track metrics will help to promote openness, transparency, and accountability, build stronger police-community relations, improve trust and confidence in policing services, evaluate specific areas of concern such as biased policing and excessive force, and ultimately improve the quality of policing services.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the attorney general's office shall establish an advisory group to assist with the office's design, development, and implementation of a statewide use of force data program. Members are appointed by the attorney general's office and must consist of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>At least three representatives from local nongovernmental organizations or advocacy groups that have a focus on or expertise in the use and role of data as it relates to interactions between law enforcement and the community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least three representatives from law enforcement agencies or organizations representing the interests of law enforcement in interacting and utilizing this data; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least one representative from the private sector or the public sector with experience in data collection programs, preferably law enforcement data collection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the advisory group has diverse and inclusive representation of those affected by its work, advisory group members whose participation in the advisory group may be hampered by financial hardship may apply for a stipend in an amount not to exceed $100 for each day during which the member attends an official meeting of the advisory group or performs prescribed duties approved by the attorney general's office.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By April 1, 2022, the advisory group shall submit to the attorney general its recommendations on the following elements:</p>

<p>How to prioritize the implementation of the reporting, collection, and publication of the use of force data reports required in section 4(2) of this act;</p>

<p>Additional incidents and data to be collected from law enforcement agencies on interactions between officers and the public, such as traffic stops, pedestrian stops, calls for services, arrests, vehicle pursuits, and disciplinary actions, as well as demographic information including race, ethnicity, and gender of a crime victim or victims. This recommendation should consider phased implementation, if necessary, based on current practices and available data as compared to additional practices and new data that would need to be implemented by law enforcement agencies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommend practices for law enforcement agencies to collect and report data to the contractor. To the greatest extent feasible, the reporting mechanisms for the program must include the opportunity for law enforcement agencies to submit the required data elements through incident reports or any other electronic means. The advisory group may also work to develop a standardized incident report that meets the data and reporting requirements of the statewide use of force data program for voluntary use by law enforcement agencies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommend practices for the public to report relevant information to the contractor directly, or its successor, including correcting misreported and otherwise incorrect data;</p>

<p>Recommend practices for public, law enforcement, and academic access and use of program data that must include, at a minimum:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Public access to deidentified raw and/or refined incident based data using an established open data standard, available online at no cost in a downloadable, machine-readable, nonproprietary format, redacted only as necessary to comply with the public records act (chapter 42.56 RCW) and the Washington state criminal records privacy act (chapter 10.97 RCW);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publicly accessible online data dashboards that summarize and analyze the data, excluding personally identifiable information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interactive data visualization tools designed for law enforcement agencies and other entities to use the data for research, professional development, training, and management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to extract data from incident reports, or other electronic means, and officer narratives in order to standardize data across multiple agencies;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure protection and removal of all personally identifiable information of officers, subjects, and victims in any data or analyses that are publicly released; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>Semiannual reports, summarizing the data collected and any related analysis, published on the website and submitted to the legislature and governor by June 1st and December 1st of each year;</li>

<p>Recommend practices in the following areas:</p>
<ol type="i">
