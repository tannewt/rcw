The list must be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder. Nothing contained in this section requires the corporation to include on such list the electronic mail address or other electronic contact information of a shareholder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shareholders' list must be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning ten days prior to the meeting and continuing through the meeting<strong>either: (a) On a reasonably accessible electronic network, on condition that the information necessary to gain access to the list is provided in or accompanies the notice of the meeting; or (b)</strong> at the corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. <strong>If the corporation elects to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareholders or their agents or attorneys.</strong> A shareholder, the shareholder's agent, or the shareholder's attorney is entitled to inspect the list, during regular business hours and at the shareholder's expense, during the period it is available for inspection.</p>

<li>
<p>An appointment made irrevocable under subsection (4) of this section is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished.</p>

<li>
<p>A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if the transferee did not know of its existence when the transferee acquired the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to RCW 23B.07.240 and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority stated in the appointment form or electronic transmission, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.</p>

<p>With respect to a corporation formed before January 1, 2020, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, shareholders entitled to vote at any election of directors are entitled to cumulate votes by multiplying the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom they are entitled to vote and to cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shares otherwise entitled to vote cumulatively may not be voted cumulatively at a particular meeting unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The meeting notice or proxy statement accompanying the notice states conspicuously that cumulative voting is authorized; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A shareholder who has the right to cumulate the shareholder's votes gives notice to the corporation not less than seventy-two hours before the time set for the meeting of the shareholder's intent to cumulate votes during the meeting, and if one shareholder gives this notice all other shareholders in the same voting group participating in the election are entitled to cumulate their votes without giving further notice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or in a bylaw adopted under RCW 23B.10.205, in any election of directors the candidates elected are those receiving the largest numbers of votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election, up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares.</p>

<li>
<p>One or more shareholders may create a voting trust, conferring on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by executing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust, which may include anything consistent with its purpose, and transferring their shares to the trustee. When a voting trust agreement is executed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all voting trust beneficial owners, together with the number and class of shares each voting trust beneficial owner transferred to the trust, and deliver copies of the list and agreement to the corporation's principal office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A voting trust becomes effective on the date the first shares subject to the trust are registered in the trustee's name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limits, if any, on the duration of a voting trust are to be as set forth in the voting trust agreement. A voting trust that became effective when this section limited the term of a voting trust to ten years will remain governed by the provisions of this section then in effect relating to the duration of voting trusts, unless the voting trust agreement is amended to provide otherwise by unanimous agreement of the parties to that agreement.</p>

<p>An agreement among the shareholders of a corporation that is not contrary to public policy and that complies with this section is effective among the shareholders and the corporation even though it is inconsistent with one or more other provisions of this title in that it:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Eliminates the board of directors or restricts the discretion or powers of the board of directors;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agreement authorized by this section shall be:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Set forth in a written agreement that is executed by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement and is made known to the corporation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to amendment only by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement required by RCW 23B.06.260(2). If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Unless the agreement provides otherwise, any person who acquires outstanding or newly issued shares in the corporation after an agreement authorized by this section has been effected, whether by purchase, gift, operation of law, or otherwise, is deemed to have assented to the agreement and to be a party to the agreement. A purchaser of shares who is aggrieved because he or she at the time of purchase did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of the agreement may either: (a) Bring an action to rescind the purchase within the earlier of ninety days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or two years after the purchase of the shares; or (b) continue to hold the shares subject to the agreement but with a right of action for any damages resulting from nondisclosure of the existence of the agreement. A purchaser shall be deemed to have constructive knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of purchase of the shares.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares have been issued when the agreement is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limits, if any, on the duration of an agreement governed by this section are to be as set forth in the agreement.
