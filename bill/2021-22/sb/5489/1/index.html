<p>For purposes of determinations under subsection (3) of this section:</p>

<p>The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (3) of this section either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances; and</p>

<li>
<p>Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section.</p>

<li>
<p>In the case of any other distribution:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the distribution is by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the earlier of the date any money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation, or the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the distribution is of indebtedness other than that described in  (a) and (b)(i) of this <strong>sub</strong>section, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and</p>

<li>
<p>In all other cases, the effect of the distribution is measured as of the date the distribution is approved if payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of approval, or the date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of approval.</p>
