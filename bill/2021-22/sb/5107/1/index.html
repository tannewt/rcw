<h2 id="section-1-677">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-677">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that after the ninth circuit court of appeals finding in Martin v. City of Boise, it is imperative that cities and counties of a certain size provide shelter to the homeless population. The provision of mental health and substance abuse treatment options must be part of the shelter model as well as security for the residents, staff, and counselors. Whereas the state has allocated money for housing assistance in the housing trust fund, the legislature also finds that such shelters should be funded utilizing that money. Cities and counties are struggling to cope with unauthorized camping and the negative environmental and social impacts of such camping. By establishing a shelter, local governments may then be allowed to manage the potential environmental hazards that accompany sporadic camping.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-532">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-532">¶</a></h2>

Each shelter must also provide for a police presence during the shelter's operating hours. Counties and each eligible city shall require and make available employment, mental health, and drug counseling services at each shelter location.</p>
