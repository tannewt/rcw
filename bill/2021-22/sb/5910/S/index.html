<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that while hydrogen fuel has been used in a variety of applications in the state, the source of hydrogen has been derived from fossil fuel feedstocks, such as natural gas. Hydrogen is an essential building block and energy carrier molecule that is necessary in the production of conventional and renewable fuels and a valuable decarbonization tool when used in sectors such as marine, aviation, steel, and cement, as well as surface transportation including light to heavy-duty vehicles, including transit, trucking, and drayage equipment. Hydrogen can be a carbon-free fuel with an energy per unit mass that is three to four times greater than jet fuel, whose energy can be extracted either through thermochemical (combustion) or electrochemical (fuel cell) processes. In both cases, the only by-product is water, instead of the greenhouse gases and other conventional and toxic pollutants that are emitted from using fossil fuels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the use of renewable hydrogen and hydrogen produced from carbon-free feedstocks through electrolysis is an essential tool to a clean energy ecosystem and emissions reduction for challenging infrastructure needs. Clean hydrogen fuel can be produced or &quot;charged&quot; closer to the generation of the electricity when the electrical supply grid has surplus energy, at times of low electricity use, such as evenings, then made available at times of higher need and convenient locations, such as fueling stations, avoiding the need to build or upgrade larger electrical infrastructure, including distribution systems, to meet higher peak demand for electricity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends by this act to establish policies and a framework for the state to become a national and global leader in the production and use of these hydrogen fuels. This act will create an office of renewable fuels to: Promote partnerships among industrial, transportation, agriculture, and commercial interests as well as fuel producers, the technology research sector, and public sector agencies; identify barriers to and opportunities for market development; provide greater clarity and certainty in regulatory and siting standards; provide incentives and financial assistance in the deployment of hydrogen fuel infrastructure; support a clean and just energy transition; help create good quality, clean energy jobs; and improve air quality in degraded areas, particularly in communities that have borne disproportionate levels of air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act, P.L. 117-58, provides $8,000,000,000 over five years to support the development of regional clean hydrogen hubs. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the United States secretary of energy to establish a program to fund at least four regional hubs to aid in achieving a hydrogen fuel production carbon intensity standard provided in that legislation; to demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage, and end use of hydrogen; and that can be developed into a national network to facilitate a clean hydrogen economy. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the secretary of energy to select regional hubs that demonstrate a diversity of feedstocks, a diversity of end uses, and a diversity of geographic regions of the country. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the secretary of energy to solicit proposals for regional hubs by May 15, 2022, and to make selections of the hubs within one year after the deadline for submission of proposals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington state is strongly positioned to develop a regional clean energy hub meeting the criteria of the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act because the state:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Has adopted a state energy strategy that recognizes hydrogen as an integral part of the state's decarbonization pathway;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has an abundance of low cost, low carbon, reliable electricity as the primary energy resource for production of clean hydrogen;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Already has under construction the nation's first renewable hydrogen electrolyzer and has several hydrogen fueling facilities as well as production facilities in planning and design phases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has numerous industrial, maritime, and freight shipping concerns that are moving toward cleaner fuels and would help provide demand for hydrogen, as well as state and local governments currently considering hydrogen uses; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a demonstrated track record of building partnerships across the public and private sector to advance clean energy technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the state may help to promote and strengthen applications for regional hydrogen hub federal funding through state funding assistance to bring together multiple interests for the purpose of timely submitting applications to the United States secretary of energy for development of a regional hydrogen hub in Washington state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the director of the department of commerce must seek to enter agreements with one or more nonprofit entities or public agencies for the purpose of preparing an application to secure federal funding to develop a regional clean hydrogen hub in Washington state. If the director determines that a single agreement with an entity to prepare an application is more competitive for federal funding than supporting multiple applications, the director may not make more than one award of funding. The director shall seek to enter a funding agreement with an entity whose proposal demonstrates:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A broad assembly of participants in developing and implementing the infrastructure of a regional hydrogen hub;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That a strong and timely application will be submitted to the United States department of energy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitments from manufacturing industries, transportation, utilities, and other sectors to incorporate hydrogen fuels into their transition to cleaner energy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the assistance in applying for federal funding provided through subsection (2) of this section, the legislature intends that the state fully support a regional clean energy hub in the state, including further direct financial assistance in developing the hub and the acquisition of hydrogen fuels for state agency and local government uses.</p>

<li>
<p>Whether the rates and services of hydrogen fuels distributed through natural gas distribution infrastructure is within the regulation of the utilities and transportation commission, or whether such jurisdiction should be assigned by the legislature as such regulation is provided for other public service companies, such as natural gas companies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether electric utilities regulated by the commission should analyze the costs and benefits of adopting special tariffs for the electrolytic production of hydrogen fuels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommended standards, including safety standards, for blending of nonfossil feedstock hydrogen into natural gas distribution infrastructure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The role that nonfossil feedstock hydrogen may serve as the state reduces greenhouse gas emissions from fossil natural gas, including findings and recommendations included in the commission's decarbonization inquiry required under section 143, chapter 334, Laws of 2021.</p>
