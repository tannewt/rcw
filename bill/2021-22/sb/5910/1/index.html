<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that while hydrogen fuel has been used in a variety of applications in the state, the source of hydrogen has been derived from fossil fuel feedstocks, such as natural gas. Hydrogen is an essential building block molecule that is necessary in the production of conventional and renewable fuels and a valuable decarbonization tool when used in sectors such as marine, aviation, steel, and cement, as well as surface transportation including light to heavy-duty trucking and drayage equipment. Hydrogen can be a carbon-free fuel with an energy per unit mass that is three to four times greater than jet fuel, whose energy can be extracted either through thermochemical (combustion) or electrochemical (fuel cell) processes. In both cases, the only by-product is water, instead of the greenhouse gases and other conventional and toxic pollutants that are emitted from using fossil fuels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the use of renewable hydrogen and hydrogen produced from carbon-free electrolysis is an essential tool to a clean energy ecosystem and emissions reduction for challenging infrastructure needs. Clean hydrogen fuel can be produced or &quot;charged&quot; when the electrical supply grid has surplus renewable energy, at times of low electricity use such as evenings, then made available at times of higher need and convenient locations without having to build a major larger electrical supply system to meet higher peak demand for electricity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends by this act to establish policies and a framework for the state to become a national and global leader in the production and use of these hydrogen fuels. This act will create an office of renewable fuels to: Promote partnerships among industrial, transportation, agriculture, and commercial interests as well as fuel producers, the technology research sector, and public sector agencies; identify barriers to and opportunities for market development; provide greater clarity and certainty in regulatory and siting standards; provide incentives and financial assistance in the deployment of hydrogen fuel infrastructure; support a clean and just energy transition; help create good quality, clean energy jobs; and improve air quality in degraded areas, particularly in communities that have borne disproportionate levels of air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act, P.L. 117-58, provides $8,000,000,000 over five years to support the development of regional clean hydrogen hubs. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the United States secretary of energy to establish a program to fund at least four regional hubs to aid in achieving a hydrogen fuel production carbon intensity standard provided in that legislation; to demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage, and end use of hydrogen; and that can be developed into a national network to facilitate a clean hydrogen economy. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the secretary of energy to select regional hubs that demonstrate a diversity of feedstocks, a diversity of end uses, and a diversity of geographic regions of the country. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the secretary of energy to solicit proposals for regional hubs by May 15, 2022, and to make selections of the hubs within one year after the deadline for submission of proposals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington state is strongly positioned to develop a regional clean energy hub meeting the criteria of the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act because the state:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Has adopted a state energy strategy that recognizes hydrogen as an integral part of the state's decarbonization pathway;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has an abundance of low-cost, reliable electricity as the primary feedstock for production of clean hydrogen;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Already hosts several hydrogen fuel production facilities as well as production facilities in planning and design phases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has numerous industrial, maritime, and freight shipping concerns that are moving toward cleaner fuels and would help provide demand for hydrogen, as well as state and local governments currently considering hydrogen uses; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a demonstrated track record of building partnerships across the public and private sector to advance clean energy technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the state may help to promote and strengthen applications for regional hydrogen hub federal funding through state funding assistance to bring together multiple interests for the purpose of timely submitting applications to the United States secretary of energy for development of a regional hydrogen hub in Washington state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the director of the department of commerce may provide funding to a port district, a public utility district, a city, a county, or any combination of such local governments, to assist in the preparation of an application to secure federal funding to develop a regional clean hydrogen hub in Washington state. If the director determines that a single application from a strong partnership in Washington state representing public and private sectors will make the application more competitive than supporting multiple applications, the director may not make more than one award of funding. The director shall solicit proposals that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Demonstrate a broad assembly of participants in developing and implementing the infrastructure of a regional hydrogen hub;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate that a strong and timely application will be submitted to the United States department of energy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include commitments from manufacturing industries, transportation, utilities, and other sectors to incorporate hydrogen fuels into their transition to cleaner energy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the assistance in applying for federal funding provided through subsection (2) of this section, the legislature intends that the state fully support a regional clean energy hub in the state, including further direct financial assistance in developing the hub and the acquisition of hydrogen fuels for state agency and local government uses.</p>

<p>Beginning July 1, 2022, the tax levied under this chapter does not apply to sales of electricity made by a light and power business to an electrolytic hydrogen production business, a renewable hydrogen production business, or a business compressing, liquifying, or dispensing electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen, for 25 years from the date of commercial operation of the business, provided the commercial operation commences no later than July 1, 2032, and provided the contract for sale of electricity to the business contains the following terms:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The electricity to be used in the electrolytic hydrogen production process, the renewable hydrogen production process, or the compression, liquification, or dispensing of the electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen is separately metered from the electricity used for general operations of the business; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The price charged for the electricity used in the electrolytic hydrogen production process, the renewable hydrogen production process, or the compression, liquification, or dispensing of electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen is reduced by an amount equal to the tax exemption available to the light and power business under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>The exemption provided for in this section does not apply to amounts received from the remarketing or resale of electricity originally obtained by contract for the production of electrolytic hydrogen, the production of renewable hydrogen, or the compression, liquification, or dispensing of electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to claim an exemption under this section, a business engaged in the production of electrolytic hydrogen, the production of renewable hydrogen, or the compression, liquification, or dispensing of electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen must provide the light and power business with an exemption certificate in a form and manner prescribed by the department.</p>

<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 407, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (section 407 of this act). The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes the tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to: Promote the construction and operation of renewable hydrogen and electrolytic hydrogen production and dispensing facilities in Washington; and provide tax treatment parity for electricity available to produce hydrogen from all of Washington's utilities serving the clean fuels markets, and tax treatment parity with the electricity used to charge and serve other storage technologies and transportation fuel markets. It is the legislature's intent to meet these public policy objectives by providing a public utility excise tax exemption on the sale of electricity used in the production of electrolytic hydrogen, the production of renewable hydrogen, and the compression, liquification, and dispensing of electrolytic hydrogen and renewable hydrogen, to reduce the average cost of electricity, which represents between 70 and 75 percent of the overall cost of operation of hydrogen electrolyzers and related infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To measure the effectiveness of the tax preferences in section 407, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (section 407 of this act) in achieving the public policy objectives described in subsection (2) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must, using calendar year 2021 as the baseline, evaluate the annual volumetric quantity of renewable hydrogen and electrolytic hydrogen produced in the state, as well as the annual percentage of hydrogen produced in the state that is either electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (3) of this section, the department of revenue must provide data needed for the joint legislative audit and review committee analysis. In addition to the data source described under this subsection, the joint legislative audit and review committee may use any other data it deems necessary.</p>
