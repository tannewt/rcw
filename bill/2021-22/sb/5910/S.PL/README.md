## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that while hydrogen fuel has been used in a variety of applications in the state, the source of hydrogen has been derived from fossil fuel feedstocks, such as natural gas. Hydrogen is an essential building block and energy carrier molecule that is necessary in the production of conventional and renewable fuels and a valuable decarbonization tool when used in sectors such as marine, aviation, steel, aluminum, and cement, as well as surface transportation including heavy-duty vehicles, such as transit, trucking, and drayage equipment. Hydrogen can be a carbon-free fuel with an energy per unit mass that is three to four times greater than jet fuel, whose energy can be extracted either through thermochemical (combustion) or electrochemical (fuel cell) processes. In both cases, the only by-product is water, instead of the greenhouse gases and other conventional and toxic pollutants that are emitted from using fossil fuels.

2. The legislature further finds that the use of renewable hydrogen and hydrogen produced from carbon-free feedstocks through electrolysis is an essential tool to a clean energy ecosystem and emissions reduction for challenging infrastructure needs. Clean hydrogen fuel can be produced or "charged" closer to the generation of the electricity when the electrical supply grid has surplus energy, at times of low electricity use, such as evenings, then made available at times of higher need and convenient locations, such as fueling stations, avoiding the need to build or upgrade larger electrical infrastructure, including distribution systems, to meet higher peak demand for electricity.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends by this act to establish policies and a framework for the state to become a national and global leader in the production and use of these hydrogen fuels. This act will create an office of renewable fuels to: Promote partnerships among industrial, transportation, agriculture, and commercial interests as well as fuel producers, the technology research sector, and public sector agencies; identify barriers to and opportunities for market development; provide greater clarity and certainty in regulatory and siting standards; provide incentives and financial assistance in the deployment of hydrogen fuel infrastructure; support a clean and just energy transition; help create good quality, clean energy jobs; and improve air quality in degraded areas, particularly in communities that have borne disproportionate levels of air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels.

## Section 201
1. [Empty]

    a. The legislature finds that the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act, P.L. 117-58, provides $8,000,000,000 over five years to support the development of regional clean hydrogen hubs. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the United States secretary of energy to establish a program to fund at least four regional hubs to aid in achieving a hydrogen fuel production carbon intensity standard provided in that legislation; to demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage, and end use of hydrogen; and that can be developed into a national network to facilitate a clean hydrogen economy. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the secretary of energy to select regional hubs that demonstrate a diversity of feedstocks, a diversity of end uses, and a diversity of geographic regions of the country. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the secretary of energy to solicit proposals for regional hubs by May 15, 2022, and to make selections of the hubs within one year after the deadline for submission of proposals.

    b. The legislature further finds that Washington state is strongly positioned to develop a regional clean energy hub meeting the criteria of the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act because the state:

        i. Has adopted a state energy strategy that recognizes hydrogen as an integral part of the state's decarbonization pathway;

        ii. Has an abundance of low cost, low carbon, reliable electricity as the primary energy resource for production of clean hydrogen;

        iii. Already has under construction the nation's first renewable hydrogen electrolyzer and has several hydrogen fueling facilities as well as production facilities in planning and design phases;

        iv. Has multiple manufacturers designing, engineering, and manufacturing fuel cell electric engines and zero-emission vehicles, vessels, and airplanes;

    v. Has numerous industrial, maritime, and freight shipping concerns that are moving toward cleaner fuels and that would help provide demand for hydrogen, as well as state and local governments currently considering hydrogen uses;

    vi. Has a demonstrated track record of building partnerships across the public and private sector to advance clean energy technologies;

    vii. Has policies in place supporting and engaging overburdened communities, including the healthy environment for all act, which will facilitate alignment with the justice40 initiative; and

    viii. Has policies, including tax incentives, that support high labor standards in clean energy production.

    c. The legislature further finds that the state may help to promote and strengthen applications for regional hydrogen hub federal funding through state funding assistance to support a timely and competitive application to the United States department of energy by a public-private partnership entity that leverages private sector leadership and is composed of multiple interests, including public and private project developers, manufacturers and end users, research institutions, academia, government, and communities around the state.

2. Subject to amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the director of the department of commerce must provide support to a public-private partnership entity as described in subsection (1)(c) of this section, which may include department staff support and direct funding. The entity should:

    a. Agree to prepare a timely and responsive application for federal funding to develop a regional clean hydrogen hub in Washington state, consistent with the requirements of the federal application process and the policies and strategy of the state of Washington;

    b. Demonstrate meaningful engagement with a range of entities across the state, including federally recognized tribes, labor unions, and communities around the state including overburdened communities, in the development of a hydrogen hub;

    c. Include entities that provide training and expand employment opportunities for the hydrogen workforce, including labor organizations, institutions of higher education, community and technical colleges, and vocational institutions; and

    d. Include specific commitments, as required by the federal application, from industries, transportation agencies, utilities, and other public and private sector entities to assist in funding the application and to develop plans to either construct infrastructure for or to incorporate, or both, the production, distribution, and end use of renewable hydrogen and green electrolytic hydrogen fuels into their transition to cleaner energy.

3. In addition to the assistance in applying for federal funding provided through subsection (2) of this section, the legislature intends that the state fully support a regional clean energy hub in the state, including further direct financial assistance in developing the hub and the acquisition of hydrogen fuels for state agency and local government uses.
