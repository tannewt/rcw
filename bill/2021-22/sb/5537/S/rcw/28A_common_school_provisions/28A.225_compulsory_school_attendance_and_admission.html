<p>Each school within a school district shall inform the students and the parents of the students enrolled in the school about: The benefits of regular school attendance; the potential effects of excessive absenteeism, whether excused or unexcused, on academic achievement, and graduation and dropout rates; the school's expectations of the parents and guardians to ensure regular school attendance by the child; the resources available to assist the child and the parents and guardians; the role and responsibilities of the school; and the consequences of truancy, including the compulsory education requirements under this chapter. The school shall provide access to the information before or at the time of enrollment of the child at a new school and at the beginning of each school year. If the school regularly and ordinarily communicates most other information to parents online, providing online access to the information required by this section satisfies the requirements of this section unless a parent or guardian specifically requests information to be provided in written form. Reasonable efforts must be made to enable parents to request and receive the information in a language in which they are fluent. A parent must date and acknowledge review of this information online or in writing before or at the time of enrollment of the child at a new school and at the beginning of each school year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall develop a template that schools may use to satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) of this section and shall post the information on its website.</p>

<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, in the event that a child in elementary school is required to attend school under RCW 28A.225.010  and has five or more excused absences in a single month during the current school year, or <strong>10</strong> or more excused absences in the current school year, the school district shall schedule a conference or conferences with the parent and child at a time reasonably convenient for all persons included for the purpose of identifying the barriers to the child's regular attendance, and the supports and resources that may be made available to the family so that the child is able to regularly attend school. If a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference day is to take place within <strong>30</strong> days of the absences, the school district may schedule this conference on that day. To satisfy the requirements of this section, the conference must include at least one school district employee such as a nurse, counselor, social worker, teacher, or community human services provider, except in those instances regarding the attendance of a child who has an individualized education program or a plan developed under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973, in which case the reconvening of the team that created the program or plan is required.</p>

<p>If a child required to attend school under RCW 28A.225.010 fails to attend school without valid justification, the public school in which the child is enrolled shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Inform the child's parent by a notice in writing or by telephone whenever the child has failed to attend school after one unexcused absence within any month during the current school year. School officials shall inform the parent of the potential consequences of additional unexcused absences. If the parent is not fluent in English, the school must make reasonable efforts to provide this information in a language in which the parent is fluent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schedule a conference or conferences with the parent and child at a time reasonably convenient for all persons included for the purpose of analyzing the causes of the child's absences after three unexcused absences within any month during the current school year. If a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference day is to take place within <strong>30</strong> days of the third unexcused absence, then the school district may schedule this conference on that day. If the child's parent does not attend the scheduled conference, the conference may be conducted with the student and school official. However the parent shall be notified of the steps to be taken to eliminate or reduce the child's absence; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point after the second and before the seventh unexcused absence, take data-informed steps to eliminate or reduce the child's absences.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>In middle school and high school, these steps must include application of the Washington assessment of the risks and needs of students (WARNS) or other assessment by a school district's designee under RCW 28A.225.026.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any child with an existing individualized education plan or 504 plan, these steps must include the convening of the child's individualized education plan or 504 plan team, including a behavior specialist or mental health specialist where appropriate, to consider the reasons for the absences. If necessary, and if consent from the parent is given, a functional behavior assessment to explore the function of the absence behavior shall be conducted and a detailed behavior plan completed. Time should be allowed for the behavior plan to be initiated and data tracked to determine progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect to any child, without an existing individualized education plan or 504 plan, reasonably believed to have a mental or physical disability or impairment, these steps must include informing the child's parent of the right to obtain an appropriate evaluation at no cost to the parent to determine whether the child has a disability or impairment and needs accommodations, related services, or special education services. This includes children with suspected emotional or behavioral disabilities as defined in WAC 392-172A-01035. If the school obtains consent to conduct an evaluation, time should be allowed for the evaluation to be completed, and if the child is found to be eligible for special education services, accommodations, or related services, a plan developed to address the child's needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These steps must include, where appropriate, providing an available approved best practice or research-based intervention, or both, consistent with the WARNS profile or other assessment, if an assessment was applied, adjusting the child's school program or school or course assignment, providing more individualized or remedial instruction, providing appropriate vocational courses or work experience, referring the child to a community engagement board, requiring the child to attend an alternative school or program, or assisting the parent or child to obtain supplementary services that might eliminate or ameliorate the cause or causes for the absence from school.</p>

<li>
<p>Has failed to comply with alternative learning experience program attendance requirements as described by the superintendent of public instruction.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If a child transfers from one school district to another during the school year, the receiving school or school district shall include the unexcused absences accumulated at the previous school or from the previous school district for purposes of this section<strong>and</strong> RCW 28A.225.030. The sending school district shall provide this information to the receiving school, together with a copy of any previous assessment as required under subsection (1)(c) of this section, history of any best practices or researched-based intervention previously provided to the child by the child's sending school district, and a copy of the most recent truancy information including any online or written acknowledgment by the parent and child, as provided for in RCW 28A.225.005.

<p>A school district representative or school employee shall review unexpected or excessive absences with a youth who is dependent pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW and adults involved with that youth, to include the youth's caseworker, educational liaison, attorney if one is appointed, parent or guardians, and foster parents or the person providing placement for the youth. The purpose of the review is to determine the cause of the absences, taking into account: Unplanned school transitions, periods of running from care, inpatient treatment, incarceration, school adjustment, educational gaps, psychosocial issues, and unavoidable appointments during the school day. A school district representative or a school employee must proactively support the youth's school work so the student does not fall behind and to avoid suspension or expulsion based on truancy.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter, &quot;community engagement board&quot; means a board established pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between a juvenile court and a school district and composed of members of the local community in which the child attends school. Community engagement boards must include members who receive training regarding the identification of barriers to school attendance, the use of the Washington assessment of the risks and needs of students (WARNS) or other assessment tools to identify the specific needs of individual children, cultural responsive interactions, trauma-informed approaches to discipline, evidence-based treatments that have been found effective in supporting at-risk youth and their families, and the specific services and treatment available in the particular school, court, community, and elsewhere. Duties of a community engagement board shall include, but not be limited to: Identifying barriers to school attendance, recommending methods for improving attendance such as connecting students and their families with community services, culturally appropriate promising practices, and evidence-based services such as functional family therapy, suggesting to the school district that the child enroll in another school, an alternative education program, an education center, a skill center, a dropout prevention program, or another public or private educational program, or recommending to the juvenile court that a juvenile be offered the opportunity for placement in a HOPE center or crisis residential center, if appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that utilization of community engagement boards is the preferred means of intervention when preliminary methods to eliminate or reduce unexcused absences as required by RCW 28A.225.020 have not been effective in securing the child's attendance at school. The legislature intends to encourage and support the development and expansion of community engagement boards. Operation of a <strong>community engagement</strong> board does not excuse a district from the obligation of filing a petition within the requirements of RCW <strong>28A.225.030</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>By the beginning of the 2017-18 school year, juvenile courts must establish, through a memorandum of understanding with each school district within their respective counties, a coordinated and collaborative approach to address truancy through the establishment of a community engagement board or, with respect to certain small districts, through other means as provided in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, each school district must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court in the county in which it is located with respect to the operation of a community engagement board. A community engagement board may be operated by a juvenile court, a school district, or a collaboration between both entities, so long as the agreement is memorialized in a memorandum of understanding. For a school district that is located in more than one county, the memorandum of understanding shall be with the juvenile court in the county that acts as the school district's treasurer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A school district with fewer than three hundred students must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court in the county in which it is located with respect to: (a) The operation of a community engagement board; or (b) addressing truancy through other coordinated means of intervention aimed at identifying barriers to school attendance, and connecting students and their families with community services, culturally appropriate promising practices, and evidence-based services such as functional family therapy. School districts with fewer than three hundred students may work cooperatively with other school districts or the school district's educational service district to ensure access to a community engagement board or to provide other coordinated means of intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All school districts must designate, and identify to the local juvenile court and to the office of the superintendent of public instruction, a person or persons to coordinate school district efforts to address excessive absenteeism and truancy, including tasks associated with: Outreach and conferences pursuant to RCW 28A.225.018; entering into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court; establishing protocols and procedures with the court; coordinating trainings; sharing evidence-based and culturally appropriate promising practices; identifying a person within every school to serve as a contact with respect to excessive absenteeism and truancy; and assisting in the recruitment of community engagement board members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As has been demonstrated by school districts and county juvenile courts around the state that have worked together and led the way with community engagement boards, success has resulted from involving the entire community and leveraging existing dollars from a variety of sources, including public and private, local and state, and court, school, and community. In emulating this coordinated and collaborative approach statewide pursuant to local memoranda of understanding, courts and school districts are encouraged to create strong community-wide partnerships and to leverage existing dollars and resources.</p>

<li>
<p>A court may order a child subject to a petition under RCW 28A.225.035 to do one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Attend the child's current school, and set forth minimum attendance requirements, which shall not consider a suspension day as an unexcused absence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is space available and the program can provide educational services appropriate for the child, order the child to attend another public school, an alternative education program, center, a skill center, dropout prevention program, or another public educational program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attend a private nonsectarian school or program including an education center. Before ordering a child to attend an approved or certified private nonsectarian school or program, the court shall: (i) Consider the public and private programs available; (ii) find that placement is in the best interest of the child; and (iii) find that the private school or program is willing to accept the child and will not charge any fees in addition to those established by contract with the student's school district. If the court orders the child to enroll in a private school or program, the child's school district shall contract with the school or program to provide educational services for the child. The school district shall not be required to contract for a weekly rate that exceeds the state general apportionment dollars calculated on a weekly basis generated by the child and received by the district. A school district shall not be required to enter into a contract that is longer than the remainder of the school year. A school district shall not be required to enter into or continue a contract if the child is no longer enrolled in the district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit to a substance abuse assessment if the court finds on the record that such assessment is appropriate to the circumstances and behavior of the child and will facilitate the child's compliance with the mandatory attendance law and, if any assessment, including a urinalysis test ordered under this subsection indicates the use of controlled substances or alcohol, order the minor to abstain from the unlawful consumption of controlled substances or alcohol and adhere to the recommendations of the substance abuse assessment at no expense to the school; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit to a mental health evaluation or other diagnostic evaluation and adhere to the recommendations of the drug assessment, at no expense to the school, if the court finds on the court records that such evaluation is appropriate to the circumstances and behavior of the child, and will facilitate the child's compliance with the mandatory attendance law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the child fails to comply with the court order, the court may impose:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Community restitution;</p>

<p>Any parent violating any of the provisions of either RCW 28A.225.010 or 28A.225.080 shall be fined not more than <strong>$25</strong> for each day of unexcused absence from school. The court shall remit <strong>50</strong> percent of the fine collected under this section to the child's school district. It shall be a defense for a parent charged with violating RCW 28A.225.010 to show that he or she exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to cause a child in his or her custody to attend school or that the child's school did not perform its duties as required in RCW 28A.225.020. The court may order the parent to provide community restitution instead of imposing a fine. Any fine imposed pursuant to this section may be suspended upon the condition that a parent charged with violating RCW 28A.225.010 shall participate with the school and the child in a supervised plan for the child's attendance at school or upon condition that the parent attend a conference or conferences scheduled by a school for the purpose of analyzing the causes of a child's absence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a child continues to be truant after entering into a court-approved order with the community engagement board under RCW 28A.225.035, the juvenile court shall find the child in contempt, and the court may impose alternatives to detention consistent with best practice models for reengagement with school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the court's inherent contempt power or curtail its exercise.</p>

<p>The protocols required by RCW 74.13.560 for making best interest determinations for students in out-of-home care must comply with the provisions of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Best interest determinations should be made as quickly as possible in order to prevent educational discontinuity for the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making best interest determinations, every effort should be made to gather meaningful input from relevant and appropriate persons on their perspectives regarding which school the student should attend during his or her time in out-of-home care, consistent with the student's case plan. Relevant and appropriate persons include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Representatives of the department of children, youth, and families;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representatives of the school of origin, such as a teacher, counselor, coach, or other meaningful person in the student's life;</p>

<p>Biological parents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster parents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational liaisons identified under RCW 13.34.045;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student's relatives; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on his or her age, the student.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In accordance with RCW 74.13.550, whenever practical and in their best interest, students placed into out-of-home care must remain enrolled in the school that they were attending at the time they entered out-of-home care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student-centered factors must be used to determine what is in a student's best interest. In order to make a well-informed best interest determination, a variety of student-centered factors should be considered, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>How long is the student's current out-of-home care placement expected to last?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the student's permanency plan and how does it relate to school stability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many schools has the student attended in the current year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many schools has the student attended over the past few years?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering the impacts of past transfers, how may transferring to a new school impact the student academically, emotionally, physically, and socially?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the immediate and long-term educational plans of, and for, the student?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How strong is the student academically?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the student has special needs, what impact will transferring to a new school have on the student's progress and services?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent are the programs and activities at the potential new school comparable to, or more appropriate than, those at the school of origin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does one school have programs and activities that address the unique needs or interests of the student that the other school does not have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which school does the student prefer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How deep are the child's ties to his or her school of origin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would the timing of the school transfer coincide with a logical juncture, such as after testing, after an event that is significant to the student, or at the end of the school year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would changing schools affect the student's ability to earn full academic credit, participate in sports or other extracurricular activities, proceed to the next grade, or graduate on time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would the commute to the school under consideration impact the student, in terms of distance, mode of transportation, and travel time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How anxious is the student about having been removed from the home or about any upcoming moves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What school does the student's sibling attend?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there safety issues to consider?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student must remain in his or her school of origin while a best interest determination is made and while disputes are resolved in order to minimize disruption and reduce the number of school transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts are encouraged to use any:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Best interest determination guide developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction during the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping the student in the school of origin or transferring the student to a new school; and</p>

<p>Dispute resolution process developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction when there is a disagreement about school placement, the provision of educational services, or a dispute between agencies.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The special education services of a student must not be interrupted by a transfer to a new school.</p>
