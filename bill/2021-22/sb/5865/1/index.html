<h2 id="section-1-607">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-607">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the department of natural resources manages public lands consistent with multiple uses of the landscape including recreational areas, trails, hunting, fishing, target shooting, and other forms of public recreation.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the multiple uses must be consistent with the applicable trust provisions of lands managed by the department of natural resources and be in the best interests of the state and the general welfare of the citizens. The legislature further finds that the department has developed rules for regulating target shooting on department-managed lands.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that designating and properly posting recreational shooting areas on lands managed by the department of natural resources would enhance the safety of all recreational users.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-483">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-483">¶</a></h2>
