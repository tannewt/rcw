<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The loan or rental of the property does not subject the property to tax if:</p>
<ol type="i">

</li>
<li>
<p>An inadvertent use of the property in a manner inconsistent with the purpose for which exemption is granted does not subject the property to tax, if the inadvertent use is not part of a pattern of use.
