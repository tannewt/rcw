<p>Before receiving a license, every real estate broker, managing broker, and firm must pay a license fee as prescribed by the director by rule. A license issued under the provisions of this chapter expires two years from the issuance date. Licenses issued to real estate firms that are partnerships, limited liability partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations, and other legally recognized business entities expire on the date when the registration or certificate of authority filed with the secretary of state expires. Licenses must be renewed every two years on or before the date established under this section and a biennial renewal license fee as prescribed by the director by rule must be paid. A license is considered expired when the licensee fails to meet the renewal requirements as of the date of renewal for that license.</p>
<p>If the director does not receive the application for a renewal license on or before the renewal date, a penalty fee as prescribed by the director by rule shall be paid. Acceptance by the director of an application for renewal after the renewal date shall not be a waiver of the delinquency.</p>
<p>The license of a person whose license renewal fee is not received within one year from the date of expiration is canceled. This person may obtain a new license by satisfying the procedures and requirements as prescribed by the director by rule.</p>
<p>The director may issue to each active licensee a license and a pocket identification card in the form and size as prescribed by rule.</p>
<p>The director must develop by rule a procedure and a schedule to ensure all active licensees and licensees applying for active status, renewal, or reinstatement have a fingerprint and background check done on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The licenses of a real estate broker and managing broker shall be kept at all times by their firm and when real estate brokers or managing brokers cease to represent the firm, their licenses shall cease to be in force. Brokers and managing brokers must submit written notification to the designated broker for their firm when they terminate affiliation with their firm.

Failure of any designated broker for the firm to promptly notify the director of a broker's or managing broker's termination after demand by the affected broker or managing broker shall be grounds for disciplinary action against the firm and designated broker. Upon application of the broker or managing broker, and the payment of a fee as prescribed by the director by rule, the director shall issue a new license for the unexpired term, if the broker or managing broker is otherwise entitled thereto. When the firm terminates a broker's or managing broker's services for a violation of this chapter, or chapter 18.86 or 18.235 RCW, the firm shall immediately file a written statement of the facts in reference thereto with the director.</p>
