<p>The department is authorized to issue grants to eligible public entities to reduce current or future hardship caused by water unavailability stemming from drought conditions. No single entity may receive more than <strong>25</strong> percent of the total funds available.

Projects must show substantial benefit from securing water supply, availability, or reliability relative to project costs. <strong>Projects do not need to be completed while a drought emergency order under RCW 43.83B.405(2) is in effect.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for projects for public water systems serving economically disadvantaged communities, the department may only fund up to <strong>50</strong> percent of the total eligible cost of the project. Money used by applicants as a cash match may not originate from other state funds.</p>
