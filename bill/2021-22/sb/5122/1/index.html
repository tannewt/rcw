<p>Children under the age of <strong>thirteen</strong> years are incapable of committing crime**, except that children** of eight <strong>through</strong> twelve years of age <strong>who are charged with murder in the first or second degree</strong> are presumed to be incapable of committing crime, but this presumption may be removed by proof that they have sufficient capacity to understand the act or neglect, and to know that it was wrong. Whenever in legal proceedings it becomes necessary to determine the age of a child, he or she may be produced for inspection, to enable the court or jury to determine the age thereby; and the court may also direct his or her examination by one or more physicians, whose opinion shall be competent evidence upon the question of his or her age.</p>

<p>NOTE: References in the grid to days or weeks mean periods of confinement. &quot;LS&quot; means &quot;local sanctions&quot; as defined in RCW 13.40.020.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Evidence-based&quot; means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Research-based&quot; means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of an A+ or A++ offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is fourteen years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A class A offense, or an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit a class A offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manslaughter in the first degree (RCW 9A.32.060);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assault in the second degree (RCW 9A.36.021), extortion in the first degree (RCW 9A.56.120), kidnapping in the second degree (RCW 9A.40.030), drive-by shooting (RCW 9A.36.045), vehicular homicide (RCW 46.61.520), hit and run death (RCW 46.52.020(4)(a)), or manslaughter 2 (RCW 9A.32.070); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of the uniform controlled substances act (RCW 69.50.401(2) (a) and (b)), when the offense includes infliction of bodily harm upon another or when during the commission or immediate withdrawal from the offense the respondent was armed with a deadly weapon;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is ordered to serve a disposition for a firearm violation under RCW 13.40.193;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a prior option B disposition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed a B++ or B+ offense, the court may impose a disposition under RCW 13.40.160(4) and 13.40.165.</p>
<p>If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.</p>

<p>RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Evidence-based&quot; means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Research-based&quot; means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of an A+ or A++ offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is fourteen years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A class A offense, or an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit a class A offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manslaughter in the first degree (RCW 9A.32.060);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assault in the second degree (RCW 9A.36.021), extortion in the first degree (RCW 9A.56.120), kidnapping in the second degree (RCW 9A.40.030), drive-by shooting (RCW 9A.36.045), vehicular homicide (RCW 46.61.520), hit and run death (RCW 46.52.020(4)(a)), or manslaughter 2 (RCW 9A.32.070); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of the uniform controlled substances act (RCW 69.50.401(2) (a) and (b)), when the offense includes infliction of bodily harm upon another or when during the commission or immediate withdrawal from the offense the respondent was armed with a deadly weapon;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Is ordered to serve a disposition for a firearm violation under RCW 13.40.193;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a prior option B disposition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed a B++ or B+ offense, the court may impose a disposition under RCW 13.40.160(4) and 13.40.165.</p>
<p>If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A diversion agreement shall be a contract between a juvenile accused of an offense and a diversion unit whereby the juvenile agrees to fulfill certain conditions in lieu of prosecution. Such agreements may be entered into only after the prosecutor, or probation counselor pursuant to this chapter, has determined that probable cause exists to believe that a crime has been committed and that the juvenile committed it. Such agreements shall be entered into as expeditiously as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion agreement shall be limited to one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Community restitution not to exceed one hundred fifty hours, not to be performed during school hours if the juvenile is attending school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restitution limited to the amount of actual loss incurred by any victim, excluding restitution owed to any insurance provider under Title 48 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attendance at up to ten hours of counseling and/or up to twenty hours of positive youth development, educational or informational sessions at a community agency. The educational or informational sessions may include sessions relating to respect for self, others, and authority; victim awareness; accountability; self-worth; responsibility; work ethics; good citizenship; literacy; and life skills. If an assessment identifies mental health or chemical dependency needs, a youth may access up to thirty hours of counseling. The counseling sessions may include services demonstrated to improve behavioral health and reduce recidivism. For purposes of this section, &quot;community agency&quot; may also mean a community-based nonprofit organization, a physician, a counselor, a school, or a treatment provider, if approved by the diversion unit. The state shall not be liable for costs resulting from the diversion unit exercising the option to permit diversion agreements to mandate attendance at up to thirty hours of counseling and/or up to twenty hours of educational or informational sessions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements to remain during specified hours at home, school, or work, and restrictions on leaving or entering specified geographical areas; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon request of any victim or witness, requirements to refrain from any contact with victims or witnesses of offenses committed by the juvenile.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, youth courts are not limited to the conditions imposed by subsection (2) of this section in imposing sanctions on juveniles pursuant to RCW 13.40.630.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In assessing periods of community restitution to be performed and restitution to be paid by a juvenile who has entered into a diversion agreement, the court officer to whom this task is assigned shall consult with the juvenile's custodial parent or parents or guardian. To the extent possible, the court officer shall advise the victims of the juvenile offender of the diversion process, offer victim impact letter forms and restitution claim forms, and involve members of the community. Such members of the community may meet with the juvenile and may advise the court officer as to the terms of the diversion agreement and may supervise the juvenile in carrying out its terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A diversion agreement may not exceed a period of six months and may include a period extending beyond the <strong>nineteenth</strong> birthday of the divertee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If additional time is necessary for the juvenile to complete restitution to a victim, the time period limitations of this subsection may be extended by an additional six months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the juvenile has not paid the full amount of restitution by the end of the additional six-month period, then the juvenile shall be referred to the juvenile court for entry of a civil order establishing the amount of restitution still owed to the victim. In this order, the court shall also determine the terms and conditions of the restitution, including a payment plan extending up to ten years if the court determines that the juvenile does not have the means to make full restitution over a shorter period. For the purposes of this subsection (5)(c), the juvenile shall remain under the court's jurisdiction for a maximum term of ten years after the juvenile's eighteenth birthday. Prior to the expiration of the initial ten-year period, the juvenile court may extend the judgment for restitution an additional ten years. The court may relieve the juvenile of the requirement to pay full or partial restitution if the juvenile reasonably satisfies the court that he or she does not have the means to make full or partial restitution and could not reasonably acquire the means to pay the restitution over a ten-year period. If the court relieves the juvenile of the requirement to pay full or partial restitution, the court may order an amount of community restitution that the court deems appropriate. The county clerk shall make disbursements to victims named in the order. The restitution to victims named in the order shall be paid prior to any payment for other penalties or monetary assessments. A juvenile under obligation to pay restitution may petition the court for modification of the restitution order.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile shall retain the right to be referred to the court at any time prior to the signing of the diversion agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divertees and potential divertees shall be afforded due process in all contacts with a diversion unit regardless of whether the juveniles are accepted for diversion or whether the diversion program is successfully completed. Such due process shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A written diversion agreement shall be executed stating all conditions in clearly understandable language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of the terms of the agreement shall be the only grounds for termination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No divertee may be terminated from a diversion program without being given a court hearing, which hearing shall be preceded by:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Written notice of alleged violations of the conditions of the diversion program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclosure of all evidence to be offered against the divertee;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hearing shall be conducted by the juvenile court and shall include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Opportunity to be heard in person and to present evidence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to confront and cross-examine all adverse witnesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A written statement by the court as to the evidence relied on and the reasons for termination, should that be the decision; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstration by evidence that the divertee has substantially violated the terms of his or her diversion agreement;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prosecutor may file an information on the offense for which the divertee was diverted:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>In juvenile court if the divertee is under <strong>nineteen</strong> years of age; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In superior court or the appropriate court of limited jurisdiction if the divertee is <strong>nineteen</strong> years of age or older.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diversion unit shall, subject to available funds, be responsible for providing interpreters when juveniles need interpreters to effectively communicate during diversion unit hearings or negotiations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diversion unit shall be responsible for advising a divertee of his or her rights as provided in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diversion unit may refer a juvenile to a restorative justice program, community-based counseling, or treatment programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to counsel shall inure prior to the initial interview for purposes of advising the juvenile as to whether he or she desires to participate in the diversion process or to appear in the juvenile court. The juvenile may be represented by counsel at any critical stage of the diversion process, including intake interviews and termination hearings. The juvenile shall be fully advised at the intake of his or her right to an attorney and of the relevant services an attorney can provide. For the purpose of this section, intake interviews mean all interviews regarding the diversion agreement process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The juvenile shall be advised that a diversion agreement shall constitute a part of the juvenile's criminal history as defined by RCW 13.40.020(8). A signed acknowledgment of such advisement shall be obtained from the juvenile, and the document shall be maintained by the diversion unit together with the diversion agreement, and a copy of both documents shall be delivered to the prosecutor if requested by the prosecutor. The supreme court shall promulgate rules setting forth the content of such advisement in simple language.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<p>When a juvenile enters into a diversion agreement, the juvenile court may receive only the following information for dispositional purposes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The fact that a charge or charges were made;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that a diversion agreement was entered into;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile's obligations under such agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the alleged offender performed his or her obligations under such agreement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facts of the alleged offense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion unit may refuse to enter into a diversion agreement with a juvenile. When a diversion unit refuses to enter a diversion agreement with a juvenile, it shall immediately refer such juvenile to the court for action and shall forward to the court the criminal complaint and a detailed statement of its reasons for refusing to enter into a diversion agreement. The diversion unit shall also immediately refer the case to the prosecuting attorney for action if such juvenile violates the terms of the diversion agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion unit may, in instances where it determines that the act or omission of an act for which a juvenile has been referred to it involved no victim, or where it determines that the juvenile referred to it has no prior criminal history and is alleged to have committed an illegal act involving no threat of or instance of actual physical harm and involving not more than fifty dollars in property loss or damage and that there is no loss outstanding to the person or firm suffering such damage or loss, counsel and release or release such a juvenile without entering into a diversion agreement. A diversion unit's authority to counsel and release a juvenile under this subsection includes the authority to refer the juvenile to community-based counseling or treatment programs or a restorative justice program. Any juvenile released under this subsection shall be advised that the act or omission of any act for which he or she had been referred shall constitute a part of the juvenile's criminal history as defined by RCW 13.40.020(8). A signed acknowledgment of such advisement shall be obtained from the juvenile, and the document shall be maintained by the unit, and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the prosecutor if requested by the prosecutor. The supreme court shall promulgate rules setting forth the content of such advisement in simple language. A juvenile determined to be eligible by a diversion unit for release as provided in this subsection shall retain the same right to counsel and right to have his or her case referred to the court for formal action as any other juvenile referred to the unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion unit may supervise the fulfillment of a diversion agreement entered into before the juvenile's <strong>nineteenth</strong> birthday and which includes a period extending beyond the divertee's <strong>nineteenth</strong> birthday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If restitution required by a diversion agreement cannot reasonably be paid due to a change of circumstance, the diversion agreement may be modified at the request of the divertee and with the concurrence of the diversion unit to convert unpaid restitution into community restitution. The modification of the diversion agreement shall be in writing and signed by the divertee and the diversion unit. The number of hours of community restitution in lieu of a monetary penalty shall be converted at the rate of the prevailing state minimum wage per hour.</p>

<p>If the juvenile has not paid the full amount of restitution by the end of the additional six-month period, then the juvenile shall be referred to the juvenile court for entry of a civil order establishing the amount of restitution still owed to the victim. In this order, the court shall also determine the terms and conditions of the restitution, including a payment plan extending up to ten years if the court determines that the juvenile does not have the means to make full restitution over a shorter period. For the purposes of this subsection (5)(c), the juvenile shall remain under the court's jurisdiction for a maximum term of ten years after the juvenile's eighteenth birthday. Prior to the expiration of the initial ten-year period, the juvenile court may extend the judgment for restitution an additional ten years. The court may relieve the juvenile of the requirement to pay full or partial restitution if the juvenile reasonably satisfies the court that he or she does not have the means to make full or partial restitution and could not reasonably acquire the means to pay the restitution over a ten-year period. If the court relieves the juvenile of the requirement to pay full or partial restitution, the court may order an amount of community restitution that the court deems appropriate. The county clerk shall make disbursements to victims named in the order. The restitution to victims named in the order shall be paid prior to any payment for other penalties or monetary assessments. A juvenile under obligation to pay restitution may petition the court for modification of the restitution order.</p>

<li>
<p>Demonstration by evidence that the divertee has substantially violated the terms of his or her diversion agreement;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prosecutor may file an information on the offense for which the divertee was diverted:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>In juvenile court if the divertee is under <strong>twenty</strong> years of age; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In superior court or the appropriate court of limited jurisdiction if the divertee is <strong>twenty</strong> years of age or older.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diversion unit shall, subject to available funds, be responsible for providing interpreters when juveniles need interpreters to effectively communicate during diversion unit hearings or negotiations.</p>

<li>
<p>The diversion unit shall be responsible for advising a divertee of his or her rights as provided in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diversion unit may refer a juvenile to a restorative justice program, community-based counseling, or treatment programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to counsel shall inure prior to the initial interview for purposes of advising the juvenile as to whether he or she desires to participate in the diversion process or to appear in the juvenile court. The juvenile may be represented by counsel at any critical stage of the diversion process, including intake interviews and termination hearings. The juvenile shall be fully advised at the intake of his or her right to an attorney and of the relevant services an attorney can provide. For the purpose of this section, intake interviews mean all interviews regarding the diversion agreement process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The juvenile shall be advised that a diversion agreement shall constitute a part of the juvenile's criminal history as defined by RCW 13.40.020(8). A signed acknowledgment of such advisement shall be obtained from the juvenile, and the document shall be maintained by the diversion unit together with the diversion agreement, and a copy of both documents shall be delivered to the prosecutor if requested by the prosecutor. The supreme court shall promulgate rules setting forth the content of such advisement in simple language.</p>

<p>The juvenile's obligations under such agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the alleged offender performed his or her obligations under such agreement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facts of the alleged offense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion unit may refuse to enter into a diversion agreement with a juvenile. When a diversion unit refuses to enter a diversion agreement with a juvenile, it shall immediately refer such juvenile to the court for action and shall forward to the court the criminal complaint and a detailed statement of its reasons for refusing to enter into a diversion agreement. The diversion unit shall also immediately refer the case to the prosecuting attorney for action if such juvenile violates the terms of the diversion agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion unit may, in instances where it determines that the act or omission of an act for which a juvenile has been referred to it involved no victim, or where it determines that the juvenile referred to it has no prior criminal history and is alleged to have committed an illegal act involving no threat of or instance of actual physical harm and involving not more than fifty dollars in property loss or damage and that there is no loss outstanding to the person or firm suffering such damage or loss, counsel and release or release such a juvenile without entering into a diversion agreement. A diversion unit's authority to counsel and release a juvenile under this subsection includes the authority to refer the juvenile to community-based counseling or treatment programs or a restorative justice program. Any juvenile released under this subsection shall be advised that the act or omission of any act for which he or she had been referred shall constitute a part of the juvenile's criminal history as defined by RCW 13.40.020(8). A signed acknowledgment of such advisement shall be obtained from the juvenile, and the document shall be maintained by the unit, and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the prosecutor if requested by the prosecutor. The supreme court shall promulgate rules setting forth the content of such advisement in simple language. A juvenile determined to be eligible by a diversion unit for release as provided in this subsection shall retain the same right to counsel and right to have his or her case referred to the court for formal action as any other juvenile referred to the unit.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If restitution required by a diversion agreement cannot reasonably be paid due to a change of circumstance, the diversion agreement may be modified at the request of the divertee and with the concurrence of the diversion unit to convert unpaid restitution into community restitution. The modification of the diversion agreement shall be in writing and signed by the divertee and the diversion unit. The number of hours of community restitution in lieu of a monetary penalty shall be converted at the rate of the prevailing state minimum wage per hour.</p>

The block grant oversight committee must establish a minimum base level of funding for juvenile courts with lower numbers of at-risk youth ten years of age and over but under <strong>twenty</strong> years of age. The department of children, youth, and families must report, in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, to the legislature by December 1, 2019, about how funding is used for referred youth and the impact of that use on overall use of funding.</p>
