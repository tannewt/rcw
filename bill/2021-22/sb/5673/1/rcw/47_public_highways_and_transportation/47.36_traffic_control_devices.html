An intersection that provides necessary linkages in a bicycle route or between routes is considered a part of the bicycle route or routes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Design complete&quot; means that all major design work for a new vehicle-activated traffic control signal has been completed and that the funding necessary for complete construction of the vehicle-activated traffic control signal has been firmly secured.</p>

<p>All existing vehicle-activated traffic control signals that do not currently routinely and reliably detect motorcycles and bicycles must be adjusted to do so to the extent that the existing equipment is capable consistent with safe traffic control. Priority must be given to existing vehicle-activated traffic control signals for which complaints relating to motorcycle or bicycle detection have been received and existing vehicle-activated traffic control signals that are otherwise identified as a detection problem for motorcyclists or bicyclists, or both.

<p>Where motorcycle and bicycle detection is limited to certain areas other than immediately before the stop line or crosswalk in the center of a lane at an existing vehicle-activated traffic control signal, those detection areas must be clearly marked on the pavement at left turn lanes, through lanes, and limited right turn lanes. These detection areas must also be marked to allow a bicyclist to leave a bicycle lane to enter a detection area, if necessary, to cross an intersection. Pavement markings must be consistent with the standards described in the state of Washington's &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways&quot; obtainable from the department of transportation.</p>

<p>The standards shall provide that a jurisdiction shall conform to these requirements, at such time thereafter that it undertakes to (1) renew or install permanent markings on the existing or new roadway, and (2) remove existing nonconforming raised pavement markers at the time the jurisdiction prepares to resurface the roadway, or earlier, at its option. These standards shall be in effect, as provided in this section, unless the legislative authority of the local governmental body finds that special circumstances exist affecting vehicle and pedestrian safety that warrant a variance to the standard.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;urbanized area&quot; means an area designated as such by the United States bureau of census and having a population of more than fifty thousand.

<p>The executive officer, or a designated employee, with control of operations and maintenance of a bridge of any county, city, town, or state agency may erect informational signs near or attached to bridges providing location-specific information about the hazards of diving or jumping from the location with the goal of preventing future deaths. These signs are meant to provide more information than just a &quot;no jumping&quot; sign so that people can better understand the hazards related to a particular location. Signs providing information on the hazard of cold-water shock that leads to drowning may be erected in locations where people might otherwise think a location is safe for swimming. Signs may include the statewide 988 suicide prevention hotline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any county, city, town, or state agency responsible for the repair, replacement, and maintenance of bridges are encouraged to create a process where individuals may request the installation of an informational sign pursuant to this section in locations that do not have such signs erected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signs created under this section may not conflict with provisions of the manual of uniform traffic control devices or existing state laws related to placement and design of signs that are placed along transportation corridors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a sign is to be located along a state highway or the interstate system, the department of transportation must be notified of the location prior to erecting the sign, but no permit is necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State and local government agencies are authorized to accept gifts or donations to pay for the erection of signs under this section.</p>

<p>Nothing contained in this section confers a right of action in cases where no right of action exists independent of this section. This section does not create a private right of action by any party and may not be used to impose liability on the owner of a government facility if a sign has or has not been posted on its property.</p>
