The equal value of all lands exchanged shall first be determined by the appraisals to the satisfaction of the commission.

<p>The beaches bounding the Pacific Ocean from the Straits of Juan de Fuca to Cape Disappointment at the mouth of the Columbia River constitute some of the last unspoiled seashore remaining in the United States. They provide the public with almost unlimited opportunities for recreational activities, like swimming, surfing and hiking; for outdoor sports, like hunting, fishing, clamming, and boating; for the observation of nature as it existed for hundreds of years before the arrival of Europeans; and for relaxation away from the pressures and tensions of modern life. In past years, these recreational activities have been enjoyed by countless Washington citizens, as well as by tourists from other states and countries. The number of people wishing to participate in such recreational activities grows annually. This increasing public pressure makes it necessary that the state dedicate the use of the ocean beaches to public recreation and to provide certain recreational and sanitary facilities. Nonrecreational use of the beach must be strictly limited. Even recreational uses must be regulated in order that Washington's unrivaled seashore may be saved for our children in much the same form as we know it today.</p>

<p>The Green River Gorge, between the town of Kanasket and the Kummer bridge in King county, is a twelve mile spectacularly winding gorge with steep to overhanging rock walls reaching heights of from one hundred fifty to three hundred feet. The beauty and natural features of the gorge are generally confined within the canyon rim. This twelve mile gorge area contains many examples of unique biological and geological features for educational and recreational interpretation, almost two miles of Eocene sediment rocks and fossils are exposed revealing one of the most complete stratographic sections to be found in the region. The area, a unique recreational attraction with more than one million seven hundred thousand people living within an hour's driving time, is presently used by hikers, geologists, fishers, kayakers and canoeists, picnickers and swimmers, and those seeking the solitude offered by this unique area. Abutting and adjacent landowners generally have kept the gorge lands in their natural state; however, economic and urbanization pressures for development are rapidly increasing. Local and state outdoor recreation plans show a regional need for resources and facilities which could be developed in this area. A twelve-mile strip incorporating the visual basins of the Green river from the Kummer bridge to Palmer needs to be acquired and developed as a conservation area to preserve this unique area for the recreational needs of the region.</p>

<p>Mt. Si and Little Si in King county offer unique scenic, natural, and geological features which can be viewed from the I-90 highway. They also afford outstanding recreational opportunities enjoyed by the citizens of this state and tourists alike. The legislature recognizes the importance of guarding portions of this area from those types of development which would permanently alter the area's natural form and beauty. It further recognizes the necessity of setting forth procedures to manage the area, to enhance the opportunities afforded the state's citizens, one-half of whom live within one-half hour driving time of Mt. Si, and to safeguard to the extent possible the scenic, natural, geological, game habitat, and recreational values therein, and to safeguard and promote the upper Snoqualmie River valley's economy in which the recreational use of Mt. Si plays a pivotal role. Therefore, the legislature declares this area to be of statewide significance for the foregoing purposes to be enhanced and safeguarded in accordance with the procedures set forth in chapter 306, Laws of 1977 ex. sess.</p>

<p>Scenic bikeways may be located over public lands with the consent of each federal, state, or local governmental entity that has jurisdiction over the public lands or through which a proposed route passes.</p>

<li>
<p>Scenic bikeways may be located over privately owned lands with the consent of the private landowner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>Prior to designating a scenic bikeway, the commission must review the proposed designation in consultation with the department of transportation and confirm the designated bicycle route:</p>

<li>
<p>Is of notable scenic, recreational, cultural, or historic value, or some combination thereof;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is consented to as required under subsection (3) of this section; and</p>

<p>Prior to designating a scenic bikeway, the commission must consult with a local government legislative authority if the scenic bikeway will be located within the local government's jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that funds available for the development of scenic bikeways limit the number of designated scenic bikeways that the commission is able to approve and implement each biennium, the commission must give priority to the designation and implementation of scenic bikeways that will add variety to the geographic location, topography, route length and difficulty, and cultural, historic, scenic, and recreational value of the statewide scenic bikeway system or that will complete existing bicycling networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must periodically review designated scenic bikeways to ensure that routes continue to meet the criteria of subsection (4) of this section. Upon review, the commission may alter the route or revoke the designation of a scenic bikeway.</p>

<p>A recreational access pass issued under chapter 79A.80 RCW is not required in order to use a designated scenic bikeway, except that the access pass requirements of chapter 79A.80 RCW apply to motor vehicles used to park or operate on any portion of a scenic bikeway located on a recreational site or lands, as that term is defined in RCW 79A.80.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The designation of a facility or roadway as a scenic bikeway by the commission does not change the liability of the commission or any other state or local government entity with respect to unintentional injury sustained by a user of a scenic bikeway.

<p>Before entering into any contract for the construction of or replacement of any bridge on land controlled by the commission, the director must consider whether to require the installation of informational signs that address the hazards of diving or jumping off the bridge as part of the contract. These signs are meant to provide more information than just a &quot;no jumping&quot; sign so that people can better understand the hazards related to a particular location. Signs with information on the hazard of cold-water shock that leads to drowning are encouraged to be installed in locations where people might otherwise think a location is safe for swimming. Signs under this section may include the statewide 988 suicide prevention hotline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signs created under this section for placement within the right-of-way of the state highway system may not conflict with provisions of the manual on uniform traffic control devices or existing state laws related to placement and design of signs that are placed along transportation corridors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not create a private right of action by, or a legal duty to, any party, and may not be used to impose liability on the commission if a sign has or has not been erected on its property. The state of Washington, including all of its agencies, subdivisions, employees, and agents, shall not be liable in tort for any violation of this act, notwithstanding any other provision of law.</p>
