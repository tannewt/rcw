<p>During this time of uncertainty affecting the future options for thousands of Washingtonians to retain their health care coverage and thousands who face high out-of-pocket costs, the people of the state of Washington declare their intention to create a single primary nonprofit health financing entity called the whole Washington health trust. The trust will simplify health care financing, eliminate administrative waste for providers, focus savings by promoting a health care delivery system that is responsive to the essential health needs of each county, and guarantee all residents may enroll for coverage of a single comprehensive set of essential health benefits as a basic human need that is essential for a productive society, without the burden of current high premiums, deductibles, or, with modest exceptions, copayments.</p>
<ol>

<p>All residents of the state of Washington are eligible for coverage through this chapter.</p>

</li>

A successor may not be liable for any assessments due from the person from whom that person has acquired a business or stock of goods if that person gives written notice to the department of such acquisition and no assessment is issued by the department within 180 days of receipt of such notice against the former operator of the business and a copy thereof mailed to such successor.</p>

Interest collected under this section shall be paid into the Washington health trust enforcement account. Interest shall not accrue on assessments from any estate in the hands of a receiver, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, common law assignee, or other liquidating officer subsequent to the date when such receiver, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, common law assignee, or other liquidating officer qualifies as such, but assessments accruing with respect to employment of persons by any receiver, executor, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy, common law assignee, or other liquidating officer shall become due and draw interest in the same manner as assessments due from other employers.

A notice specifying the property to be sold and the time and place of sale shall be posted in at least two public places in the county wherein the seizure has been made. The time of sale shall be not less than 10 nor more than 20 days from the date of posting of such notices. The sale may be adjourned from time to time at the discretion of the commissioner, but not for a time to exceed in all 60 days. The sale shall be conducted by the commissioner or his or her authorized representative who shall proceed to sell such property by parcel or by lot at a public auction, and who may set a minimum price to include the expenses of making a levy and of advertising the sale. If the amount bid for the property at the sale is not equal to the minimum fixed price, the commissioner or his or her representative may declare the property to be purchased by the department for the minimum price. In this event the delinquent account shall be credited with the amount for which the property has been sold. Property acquired by the department may be sold by the commissioner or his or her representative at public or private sale, and the amount realized shall be placed in the Washington health trust enforcement account. In all cases of sale, the commissioner shall issue a bill of sale or a deed to the purchaser and the bill of sale or deed shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the commissioner to make the sale and conclusive evidence of the regularity of his or her proceeding in making the sale, and shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the delinquent employer in the property. The proceeds of this sale, except in those cases wherein the property has been acquired by the department, shall be first applied by the commissioner in satisfaction of the delinquent account, and out of any sum received in excess of the amount of delinquent assessments, interest, and penalties the administration fund shall be reimbursed for the costs of distraint and sale.

The effect of a notice to withhold and deliver shall be continuous from the date the notice and order to withhold and deliver is first made until the liability is satisfied or becomes unenforceable because of a lapse of time. The notice and order to withhold and deliver shall be served by the sheriff or the sheriff's deputy of the county where the service is made, using a method by which the mailing can be tracked or the delivery can be confirmed, or by a duly authorized representative of the commissioner. Any person, firm, corporation, political subdivision, or department upon whom service has been made must answer the notice within 20 days exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired of in the notice. If there is in the possession of any such person, firm, corporation, political subdivision, or department, any property which may be subject to the claim of the department of the state, such property shall be delivered to the commissioner or the commissioner's duly authorized representative upon demand to be held in trust by the commissioner for application on the indebtedness involved or for return, without interest, in accordance with final determination of liability or nonliability, or in the alternative, there shall be furnished a good and sufficient bond satisfactory to the commissioner conditioned upon final determination of liability. Should any person, firm, or corporation fail to make answer to an order to withhold and deliver within the time prescribed, the court may, after the time to answer such order has expired, to render judgment by default against the person, firm, or corporation for the full amount claimed by the commissioner in the notice to withhold and deliver, together with costs.</p>

The clerk of the county where the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for the warrant, and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of the employer mentioned in the warrant, the amount of the tax, interest, penalties, and filing fee, and the date when the warrant was filed. The aggregate amount of the warrant as docketed becomes a lien upon the title to, and interest in all real and personal property of the employer against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case duly docketed in the office of the clerk. The warrant is sufficient to support the issuance of writs of execution and writs of garnishment in favor of the state in the manner provided by law in the case of civil judgment, wholly or partially unsatisfied. The clerk of the court is entitled to a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10), which shall be added to the amount of the warrant, and charged by the commissioner to the employer or employing unit.

In order to avail itself of the lien, the department shall file with any county auditor where property of the employer is located a statement and claim of lien specifying the amount of delinquent assessments, interest, and penalties claimed by the department. From the time of filing for record, the amount required to be paid shall constitute a lien upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, in the county, owned by the employer or acquired by him or her. The lien is not valid against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lien, or judgment lien creditor until notice thereof has been filed with the county auditor. This lien is separate and apart from, and in addition to, any other lien or claim created by, or provided for in, this chapter. When any such notice of lien has been filed, the commissioner may release the same by filing a certificate of release when it appears that the amount of delinquent assessments, interest, and penalties have been paid, or when adequate assurance of payment is made. Fees for filing and releasing the lien may be charged to the employer and may be collected from the employer using the remedies provided in this chapter for the collection of assessments.</p>

The lien is prior to all other liens or claims except prior tax liens, other liens provided by this chapter, and claims for remuneration for services of not more than $250 to each claimant earned within six months of the commencement of the proceeding. The existence of a condition of insolvency or the institution of any judicial proceeding for legal dissolution or of any proceeding for distribution of assets shall cause the lien to attach without action on behalf of the commissioner or the state.
