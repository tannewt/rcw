<p>For benefits payable beginning January 1, 2020, any self-employed person, including a sole proprietor, independent contractor, partner, or joint venturer, may elect coverage under this title for an initial period of not less than three years and subsequent periods of not less than one year immediately following a period of coverage. Those electing coverage under this section must elect coverage for both family leave and medical leave and are responsible for payment of one hundred percent of all premiums assessed to an employee under RCW 50A.10.030. The self-employed person must file a notice of election in writing with the department, in a manner as required by the department in rule. The self-employed person is eligible for family and medical leave benefits after working eight hundred twenty hours in the state during the qualifying period following the date of filing the notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A self-employed person who has elected coverage may withdraw from coverage within thirty days after the end of each period of coverage, or at such other times as the commissioner may adopt by rule, by filing a notice of withdrawal in writing with the commissioner, such withdrawal to take effect not sooner than thirty days after filing the notice with the commissioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may cancel elective coverage if the self-employed person fails to make required payments or file reports. The department may collect due and unpaid premiums and may levy an additional premium for the remainder of the period of coverage. The cancellation shall be effective no later than thirty days from the date of the notice in writing advising the self-employed person of the cancellation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those electing coverage are considered employers or employees where the context so dictates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;independent contractor&quot; means an individual excluded from employment under RCW 50A.05.010(8)(b) (iii) and (iv).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing and implementing the requirements of this section, the department shall adopt government efficiencies to improve administration and reduce costs. These efficiencies may include, but are not limited to, requiring that payments be made in a manner and at intervals unique to the elective coverage program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt rules for determining the hours worked and the wages of individuals who elect coverage under this section and rules for enforcement of this section.</p>

<p>Beginning January 1, 2019, the department shall assess for each individual in employment with an employer and for each individual electing coverage a premium based on the amount of the individual's wages subject to subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The premium rate for family leave benefits shall be equal to one-third of the total premium rate.</p>
</li>

<p>The premium rate for medical leave benefits shall be equal to two-thirds of the total premium rate.</p>

<p>For calendar year 2022 and thereafter, the commissioner shall determine the percentage of paid claims related to family leave benefits and the percentage of paid claims related to medical leave benefits and adjust the premium rates set in subsection (1)(b) and (c) of this section by the proportional share of paid claims.</p>

<p>Beginning January 1, 2019, and ending December 31, 2020, the total premium rate shall be four-tenths of one percent of the individual's wages subject to subsection (4) of this section.</p>

<p>For family leave premiums, an employer may deduct from the wages of each employee up to the full amount of the premium required.</p>

<li>
<p>For calendar year 2021 and thereafter, the total premium rate shall be based on the family and medical leave insurance account balance ratio as of September 30th of the previous year. The commissioner shall calculate the account balance ratio by dividing the balance of the family and medical leave insurance account by total covered wages paid by employers and those electing coverage. The division shall be carried to the fourth decimal place with the remaining fraction disregarded unless it amounts to five hundred-thousandths or more, in which case the fourth decimal place shall be rounded to the next higher digit.

<p>Five tenths of one percent or greater, the premium is one tenth of one percent of the individual's wages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2021, if the account balance ratio calculated in subsection (6) of this section is below five hundredths of one percent, the commissioner must assess a solvency surcharge at the lowest rate necessary to provide revenue to pay for the administrative and benefit costs of family and medical leave, for the calendar year, as determined by the commissioner. The solvency surcharge shall be at least one-tenth of one percent and no more than six-tenths of one percent and be added to the total premium rate for family and medical leave benefits. <strong>Any projected expenditures of general fund moneys into the family and medical leave insurance account pursuant to section 715 of this act must be excluded from the commissioner's determination of the necessary revenue to pay the administrative and benefit costs of family and medical leave for the calendar year.</strong></p>

<p>An employer may file an application with the department for a conditional waiver for the payment of family and medical leave premiums, assessed under RCW 50A.10.030, for any employee who:</p>

<li>
<p>If the department finds any of the conditions in subsection (1) of this section are no longer satisfied, or were not satisfied at any point after a conditional waiver was approved and is in effect, the department will consider the conditional waiver expired and the employer and employee will be responsible for their shares of all premiums that would have been paid during this period had the waiver not been granted. Upon payment of the missed premiums, the employee will be credited for the hours worked and will be eligible for benefits under this title as if the premiums were originally paid.</p>

A successor may not be liable for any premiums due from the person from whom that person has acquired a business or stock of goods if that person gives written notice to the employment security department of such acquisition and no assessment is issued by the department within one hundred eighty days of receipt of such notice against the former operator of the business and a copy thereof mailed to such successor.</p>
