<p>The legislature finds that the need for long-range state program planning and for the short-range planning carried on through the budget process, complement each other. The biennial budget submitted to the legislature must be considered in the light of the longer-range plans and goals of the state. The effectiveness of the short-range plan presented as budget proposals, cannot be measured without being aware of these longer-range goals. Thus efficient management requires that the planning and fiscal activities of state government be integrated into a unified process. It is the purpose of this chapter to bring these functions together in a new division of the office of the governor to be called the office of financial management.</p>

The revolving fund shall not be used for the acquisition, maintenance, or operations of local telecommunications infrastructure or the maintenance or depreciation of on-premises video equipment specific to a particular institution or group of institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The revolving fund and all disbursements from the revolving fund are subject to the allotment procedure under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. The office shall, subject to the review and approval of the office of financial management, establish and implement a billing structure for network services identified in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office shall charge those public entities connected to the K-20 telecommunications system under RCW 43.41.393 an annual copayment per unit of transport connection as determined by the legislature after consideration of the board's recommendations. This copayment shall be deposited into the revolving fund to be used for the purposes in subsection (1) of this section. It is the intent of the legislature to appropriate to the revolving fund such moneys as necessary to cover the costs for transport, maintenance, and depreciation of data equipment located at the individual public institutions, maintenance and depreciation of the K-20 network backbone, and services provided to the network under RCW 43.41.391.</p>
