<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that green roofs can improve the energy performance of buildings, help manage stormwater, reduce airborne emissions, and mitigate the effects of urban heat islands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater weatherization and insulation offered by green roof assemblies reduces the amount of energy needed to moderate the temperature of a building, as roofs can be the source of the greatest heat loss in the winter and the hottest temperatures in the summer. Green roofs can also prolong the service life of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems through decreased use. The temperature moderating effects of green roofs can reduce demand for electrical power and other energy and fuel sources, and potentially decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other polluting byproducts being released into the air.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A properly designed and maintained green roof can last more than 40 years before requiring replacement, whereas the life of an unvegetated conventional roof could be 10 to 15 years. By increasing the life cycle and reducing roof replacement costs, green roofs can save taxpayer and building owners money and reduce the amount of waste that is diverted into landfills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that green roofs, biosolar roofs, and blue/green roofs can reduce the amount of stormwater runoff and delay the time at which runoff occurs, resulting in decreased stress on sewer systems and streams at peak flow periods and decreased pollution in Washington's waterways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green roof plants can capture dust, particulate matter, airborne pollutants, and atmospheric deposition, sequester carbon, and filter noxious gases throughout cities. This can play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting urban areas to a future climate with warmer summers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds the installation of green roofs can help reduce urban heat islands by cooling the air. Through natural transpiration, plants on vertical and horizontal surfaces can cool cities during hot summer months and reduce the urban heat island effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green roofs can provide much needed green spaces for healthy human habitation of dense urban spaces and can be used for passive and active recreation and relaxation. Green roofs improve human health and well-being through the improvement of local air quality, regulation of temperature, and filtration of harmful airborne substances, particularly among children and other vulnerable or at-risk communities. These green spaces can also facilitate healthy biosystems by creating new habitat for a wide variety of plants and animals such as migratory birds and insects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that green roofs and related assemblies such as blue/green roofs, agrivoltaic roofs, and biosolar roofs can generate local and regional employment for design, installation, and maintenance personnel. Specialized green roof installations can also generate income and employment for rural communities in terms of nurseries and growing media blenders and through the establishment of urban rooftop farm operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that to reach our energy and environmental goals in response to the climate emergency, it is important to utilize clean energy generation technology. Solar panels provide carbon emission free energy and can be installed on existing buildings and infrastructure. Installing solar energy systems benefits the health, welfare, and resiliency of communities. Green roofs and solar energy are compatible systems that can be combined on the same rooftop to create a biosolar roof. The combination of the two systems can be complementary and improve the environmental and energy benefits of each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore determines that is it in the state's interest to maximize the full potential of its roofs by requiring green roofs and solar panel energy generation to reduce energy consumption, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce the urban heat island effect, reduce stormwater runoff and urban flooding, improve food security, strengthen human health outcomes, and increase Washington state's climate resilience. Similar legislation requiring green roofs on new buildings has already been implemented in places such as New York, California, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington DC, and throughout Europe and Asia.</p>
