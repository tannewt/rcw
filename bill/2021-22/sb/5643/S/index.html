<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>As of July 2019, almost 22 percent of the population of Washington state was under 18 years of age. The legislature finds that it is critical to invest in both the formal and informal education of the youth of the state. While there are existing youth development programs in the state, it is in the best interest of the state to sponsor youth agriculture education and development programs by voluntary grassroots advocacy organizations and career and technical student organizations focusing on agricultural education. In addition to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and robotics, this youth development program must focus on animal husbandry and agricultural education.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/15_agriculture_and_marketing/15.076_agricultural_fairs_youth_shows_exhibitions.html">15.76</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/15_agriculture_and_marketing/15.076_agricultural_fairs_youth_shows_exhibitions.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Voluntary, grassroots organizations representing the social and economic interest of farm and ranch families at the local, state, and national levels may sponsor youth development programs to promote participation in agricultural fairs, youth shows, and exhibitions and education in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and robotics as well as animal husbandry and agricultural education. The youth development program must incorporate civics, civil society, and participation in government into its programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is in the public interest to support youth participation in youth development programs as described in subsection (1) of this section, programs authorized in RCW 36.50.010, and membership in the Washington FFA association, which is the agricultural education career and technical student organization recognized by the office of the superintendent of public instruction. The legislature will appropriate funds to fulfill the enrollment fees owed to the programs by participants as a state allocation as defined in RCW 15.76.110.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to receive appropriated funds, after the annual enrollment period, the program must submit a roster of enrolled youth to the department in order to receive a reimbursement of all enrollment fees. Any other fees submitted for reimbursement must be done before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
