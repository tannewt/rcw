<p>The initial county officers of a new county during the interim period are subject to all state laws limiting the authority of or imposing obligations on such offices as if the new county were fully established.</p>
<h2 id="section-31-45">Section 31 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-31-45">¶</a></h2>
<p>All ordinances, rules, and regulations of a parent county that are in effect at the beginning of the interim period for a new county and that are adopted by the parent county during the interim period of a new county have their full force and effect within the portion of the parent county that is stricken to form the new county until the end of the interim period, unless repealed by the parent county before that date.</p>
<h2 id="section-32-35">Section 32 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-32-35">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the interim period for a new county, the parent county or counties remains responsible for providing all county services previously provided by that parent county in the portion of the parent county that is stricken to form a new county at the current level of service, unless otherwise agreed to between the parent county and the initial officers of the new county.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The initial board of county commissioners shall adopt a budget for the interim period and make any subsequent amendments in consultation with the state auditor and the department of community, trade, and economic development. The department of community, trade, and economic development shall provide to the initial officers of the new county, at the earliest date feasible after the election authorizing formation of the new county, a report detailing the potential revenues and expenses of the new county. The interim period budget may initially authorize expenditure of moneys by general category without specific detail.
