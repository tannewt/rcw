<ol>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>After bids that are submitted in response to a competitive solicitation process are reviewed by the awarding county, the awarding county may:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Reject all bids and rebid or cancel the competitive solicitation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request best and final offers from responsive and responsible bidders; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Award the purchase or contract to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county may award one or more contracts from a competitive solicitation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether the bidder is a responsible bidder, the county must consider the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the bidder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bidder can perform the contract within the time specified;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of performance of previous contracts or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws relating to the contract or services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether, within the three-year period immediately preceding the date of the bid solicitation, the bidder has been determined by a final and binding citation and notice of assessment issued by the department of labor and industries or through a civil judgment entered by a court of limited or general jurisdiction to have willfully violated, as defined in RCW 49.48.082, any provision of chapter 49.46, 49.48, or 49.52 RCW; and</p>

<li>
<p>Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the decision to award the contract.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the unique aspects of electric ferry design and the importance of well-integrated ship and shore equipment, in determining the lowest responsive and responsible bidder for the design and procurement of an electric ferry, a county may consider best value criteria, including but not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the bid satisfies the needs of the county as specified in the solicitation documents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid encourages diverse contractor participation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid provides competitive pricing, economies, and efficiencies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid considers human health and environmental impacts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the bid appropriately weighs cost and noncost considerations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life-cycle cost;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project manager capabilities, including subcontractor management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposed approach to overall project plan, including integration, commissioning, and acceptance testing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrated contractor and subcontractor technical knowledge or specific technical capabilities to meet technical elements of the design specified in the bid documents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solicitation document must clearly set forth the requirements and criteria that the contract will apply in evaluating bid submissions. Before award of a contract, a bidder shall submit to the contracting county a signed statement in accordance with chapter 5.50 RCW verifying under penalty of perjury that the bidder is in compliance with the responsible bidder criteria requirement of subsection (2)(f) of this section. A contracting county may award a contract in reasonable reliance upon such a sworn statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The awarding county may at its discretion reject the bid of any contractor who has failed to perform satisfactorily on a previous contract with the county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reviewing all bid submissions, a county may enter into negotiations with the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in order to determine if the bid may be improved. A county may not use this negotiation opportunity to permit a bidder to change a nonresponsive bid into a responsive bid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (a) of this subsection, all proceedings, records, contracts, and other public records relating to electric ferry design and procurement under this chapter shall be open to the inspection of any interested person, firm, or corporation in accordance with chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>All documents related to a procurement under chapter 224, Laws of 2021 are exempt from disclosure until the notification of the highest scoring finalist is made or the selection process is terminated.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Where critical equipment selections can be made to mature a ferry design, reducing cost and performance risk in shipyard contracts, these selections may be made and the chosen vendors specified by name in bid specifications without allowing substitutions. Counties and their consultants may evaluate cost and noncost considerations when making these selections provided that the selection is made in good faith to identify the equipment best suited to the county's needs.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The contract for the public work shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. Any or all bids may be rejected for good cause. The county legislative authority shall require from the successful bidder for such public work a contractor's bond in the amount and with the conditions imposed by law.</p>

<p>Whenever a county subject to these provisions has had public works performed in any budget period up to the maximum permitted amount for that budget period, all remaining public works except emergency work under subsection (13) of this section within that budget period shall be done by contract pursuant to public notice and call for competitive bids as specified in subsection (3) of this section. The state auditor shall report to the state treasurer any county subject to these provisions that exceeds this amount and the extent to which the county has or has not reduced the amount of public works it has performed by public employees in subsequent years.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>A county may procure public works with a unit priced contract under this section for the purpose of completing anticipated types of work based on hourly rates or unit pricing for one or more categories of work or trades.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;unit priced contract&quot; means a competitively bid contract in which public works are anticipated on a recurring basis to meet the business or operational needs of the county, under which the contractor agrees to a fixed period indefinite quantity delivery of work, at a defined unit price for each category of work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit priced contracts must be executed for an initial contract term not to exceed one year, with the county having the option of extending or renewing the unit priced contract for one additional year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invitations for unit price bids shall include, for purposes of the bid evaluation, estimated quantities of the anticipated types of work or trades, and specify how the county will issue or release work assignments, work orders, or task authorizations pursuant to a unit priced contract for projects, tasks, or other work based on the hourly rates or unit prices bid by the contractor. The contract must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder as defined under RCW 39.04.010. Whenever possible, the county must invite at least one bid from a certified minority or woman contractor who otherwise qualifies under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit price contractors shall pay prevailing wages for all work that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of chapter 39.12 RCW. Prevailing wages for all work performed pursuant to each work order must be the prevailing wage rates in effect at the beginning date for each contract year. Unit priced contracts must have prevailing wage rates updated annually. Intents and affidavits for prevailing wages paid must be submitted annually for all work completed within the previous twelve-month period of the unit priced contract.</p>

<li>
<p>If a county subject to these provisions has public works performed by public employees in any budget period that are in excess of this ten percent limitation, the amount in excess of the permitted amount shall be reduced from the otherwise permitted amount of public works that may be performed by public employees for that county in its next budget period. Ten percent of the motor vehicle fuel tax distributions to that county shall be withheld if two years after the year in which the excess amount of work occurred, the county has failed to so reduce the amount of public works that it has performed by public employees. The amount withheld shall be distributed to the county when it has demonstrated in its reports to the state auditor that the amount of public works it has performed by public employees has been reduced as required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the percentage limitation provided in subsection (8) of this section, counties subject to these provisions containing a population of four hundred thousand or more shall not have public employees perform: A public works project in excess of ninety thousand dollars if more than a single craft or trade is involved with the public works project, a riverine project or stormwater project in excess of two hundred fifty thousand dollars if more than a single craft or trade is involved with the riverine project or stormwater project, a public works project in excess of forty-five thousand dollars if only a single craft or trade is involved with the public works project, or a riverine project or stormwater project in excess of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars if only a single craft or trade is involved with the riverine project or stormwater project. A public works project, a riverine project, and a stormwater project means a complete project. The restrictions in this subsection do not permit the division of the project into units of work or classes of work to avoid the restriction on work that may be performed by public employees on a single project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The cost of a separate public works project shall be the costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor on the construction of that project. The value of the public works budget shall be the value of all the separate public works projects within the budget.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>In addition to the accounting and recordkeeping requirements contained in chapter 39.04 RCW, any county which uses public employees to perform public works projects under RCW 36.32.240(1) shall prepare a year-end report to be submitted to the state auditor indicating the total dollar amount of the county's public works construction budget and the total dollar amount for public works projects performed by public employees for that year.</li>
</ol>
<p>The year-end report submitted pursuant to this subsection to the state auditor shall be in accordance with the standard form required by RCW 43.09.205.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, counties may use public employees without any limitation for emergency work performed under an emergency declared pursuant to RCW 36.32.270, and any such emergency work shall not be subject to the limitations of this section. Publication of the description and estimate of costs relating to correcting the emergency may be made within seven days after the commencement of the work. Within two weeks of the finding that such an emergency existed, the county legislative authority shall adopt a resolution certifying the damage to public facilities and costs incurred or anticipated relating to correcting the emergency. Additionally this section shall not apply to architectural and engineering or other technical or professional services performed by public employees in connection with a public works project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lieu of the procedures of subsections (3) through (12) of this section, a county may let contracts using the small works roster process provided in RCW 39.04.155.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever possible, the county shall invite at least one proposal from a certified minority or woman contractor who shall otherwise qualify under this section.</p>

<li>
<p>The allocation of public works projects to be performed by county employees shall not be subject to a collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p>No contract for public works may be entered into by the county legislative authority or by any elected or appointed officer of the county until after bids have been submitted to the county upon specifications therefor. Such specifications shall be in writing and shall be filed with the clerk of the county legislative authority for public inspection. An advertisement shall be published in the county official newspaper stating the time and place where bids will be opened, the time after which bids will not be received, the character of the work to be done, the materials and equipment to be furnished, and that specifications therefor may be seen at the office of the clerk of the county legislative authority. An advertisement shall also be published in a legal newspaper of general circulation in or as near as possible to that part of the county in which such work is to be done. If the county official newspaper is a newspaper of general circulation covering at least forty percent of the residences in that part of the county in which such public works are to be done, then the publication of an advertisement of the applicable specifications in the county official newspaper shall be sufficient.
