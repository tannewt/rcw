<p>This act may be known and cited as the education equity in every zip code act or EEEZ act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-478">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-478">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that too many children in our state remain trapped in a system where the quality of, and access to, their education is determined by their zip code. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the nearly year long school closures that resulted, have only exacerbated this unfairness. While the legislature, in addressing the McCleary decision, made inroads by increasing state funding for basic education and decreasing reliance on local levies, this progress was significantly undermined in 2019 when the legislature raised local levy authority by 67 percent, thus returning to greater reliance on local levies to fund education and the inherent inequities in such a funding system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is appropriate and necessary to reduce the reliance on local levies in our school system and accordingly to significantly increase the state's basic education funding in ways that will address these funding and educational inequities. Eliminating a system where a child's quality of, and access to, education is tied to their zip code is the equity issue of our time and critical to our state's future and the future of our children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act makes permanent enhancements to the basic education funding formula that will increase equity including: Increasing special education funding; providing key student support staff, such as nurses and mental health counselors; lowering class sizes for vocational education classes and skills centers; and enhancing access to and funding for gifted education programs. Schools serving a high percentage of low-income students are aided with greater funding for the learning assistance program, and property-poor districts receive increased state funding for local effort assistance to alleviate inequities with their wealthier counterparts. These funding increases will lead to more level access across the state to critical and fundamental services for students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further takes notice that the pandemic, and the nearly year long absence from in-person learning that occurred, has taken a significant toll on the academic progress of our children. The most recent state assessment found that only three in 10 students are at grade level in math and less than one in two are at grade level in English, both marked declines from prepandemic levels. The figures are significantly worse for lower-income, special education, and Native American, black, and Hispanic students. To remedy this and to get children back on track, this act proposes hundreds of millions in funding to districts over the upcoming school years to address the learning loss. Schools are incentivized to choose innovative methods including a balanced school calendar or increased instructional hours, to improve student performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends with the education equity in every zip code act to remedy the infirmities in the present system and assist students, regardless of their zip code, to achieve their highest potential.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that, for highly capable students, access to accelerated learning and enhanced instruction is access to a basic education. There are multiple definitions of highly capable, from intellectual to academic to artistic. The research literature strongly supports using multiple criteria to identify highly capable students, and therefore, the legislature does not intend to prescribe a single method. Instead, the legislature intends to allocate funding based on <strong>7.0</strong> percent of each school district's population and authorize school districts to identify through the use of multiple, objective criteria those students most highly capable and eligible to receive accelerated learning and enhanced instruction in the program offered by the <strong>school</strong> district. District practices for identifying the most highly capable students must prioritize equitable identification of low-income students. Access to accelerated learning and enhanced instruction through the program for highly capable students does not constitute an individual entitlement for any particular student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplementary funds provided by the state for the program for highly capable students under RCW 28A.150.260 shall be categorical funding to provide services to highly capable students as determined by a school district under RCW 28A.185.030.</p>
