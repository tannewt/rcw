<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section for the initial registration of an instrument or device, no weighing or measuring instrument or device may be used for commercial purposes in the state unless its commercial use is registered annually. If its commercial use is within a city that has a city sealer and a weights and measures program as provided by RCW 19.94.280, the commercial use of the instrument or device must be registered with the city if the city has adopted fees pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. If its commercial use is outside of such a city, the commercial use of the instrument or device must be registered with the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city with such a sealer and program may establish an annual fee for registering the commercial use of such a weighing or measuring instrument or device with the city. The annual fee may not exceed the fee established in RCW 19.94.175 for registering the use of a similar instrument or device with the department. Fees upon weighing or measuring instruments or devices within the jurisdiction of the city that are collected under this subsection by city sealers must be deposited into the general fund, or other account, of the city as directed by the governing body of the city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registrations with the department are accomplished as part of the business licensing system under chapter 19.02 RCW. Payment of the registration fee for a weighing or measuring instrument or device under the business licensing system constitutes the registration required by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fees established by or under RCW 19.94.175 for registering a weighing or measuring instrument or device must be paid to the department of revenue concurrently with an application for a business license under chapter 19.02 RCW or with the annual renewal of a business license under chapter 19.02 RCW. A weighing or measuring instrument or device must be initially registered with the state at the time the owner applies for a business license for a new business or at the first renewal of the license that occurs after the instrument or device is first placed into commercial use. The department of revenue must remit to the department of agriculture all fees collected under this provision less reasonable collection expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each city charging registration fees under this section must notify the department of agriculture at the time such fees are adopted and whenever changes in the fees are adopted.</p>

<li>
<p>Interoperability standards provide safeguards to consumers and support access to electric vehicle supply equipment. In order for Washington to have reliable, accessible, and competitive markets for electric vehicle supply equipment that are necessary for the movement of goods and people by electric vehicles, interoperability standards that align with national and international best practices or standards are necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2023, the department, in consultation with the department of commerce and the Washington utilities and transportation commission, must adopt rules establishing requirements for all electric vehicle service providers to, at a minimum, meet and maintain nonproprietary interoperability standards for publicly available level 2 electric vehicle supply equipment and direct current fast charger electric vehicle supply equipment and may review and, if necessary, amend the rules every two years, to maintain consistency with evolving technology. The requirements shall not provide that any charging provider must purchase or license proprietary technology or software from any other company, and shall not require that companies maintain interoperability agreements with other companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of this section, &quot;interoperability&quot; means the ability of hardware, software, or a communications network provided by one party, vendor, or service provider to interact with or exchange and make use of information, including payment information, between hardware, software, or a communications network provided by a different party, vendor, or service provider.</p>
</li>

<p>The requirements of this section shall not apply to publicly available electric vehicle supply equipment provided by a manufacturer of electric vehicles for the exclusive use by vehicles it manufactures.</p>
