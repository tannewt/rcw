<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Washington state is experiencing rapid population growth and its citizens are increasingly mobile;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a fundamental need for a healthful, clean, and beautiful environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proliferation and accumulation of litter discarded throughout this state impairs this need and constitutes a public health hazard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a need to conserve energy and natural resources, and the effective litter control and recovery and recycling of litter materials will serve to accomplish such conservation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to effective litter control, there must be effective programs to accomplish waste reduction, the state's highest waste management priority; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must also be effective systems to accomplish all components of recycling, including collection and processing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognizing the multifaceted nature of the state's solid waste management problems, the legislation enacted in 1971 and entitled the &quot;Model Litter Control and Recycling Act&quot; is hereby renamed the &quot;waste reduction, recycling, and model litter control act.&quot;</p>

<li>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to accomplish litter control, increase waste reduction, and stimulate all components of recycling and composting throughout this state by delegating to the department of ecology the authority to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Conduct a permanent and continuous program to control and remove litter from this state to the maximum practical extent possible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recover and recycle waste materials related to litter and littering;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster public and private recycling of recyclable materials and composting of compostable materials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase public awareness of the need for waste reduction, recycling, litter control, and composting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate the litter collection efforts by other agencies identified in this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate and expend funds collected under chapter 82.19 RCW with priority given to products identified under RCW 82.19.020 and solely for the purposes of waste reduction, recycling, composting, and litter collection and control programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is further the intent and purpose of this chapter to: (a) Create jobs for employment of youth in litter cleanup and related activities; (b) stimulate and encourage recycling; and (c) encourage proper and appropriate composting. This program shall include the compatible goal of recovery of recyclable materials to conserve energy and natural resources wherever practicable. Every other department of state government and all local governmental units and agencies of this state shall cooperate with the department of ecology in the administration and enforcement of this chapter. The intent of this chapter is to add to and to coordinate existing recycling and litter control and removal efforts and not terminate or supplant such efforts.</p>
