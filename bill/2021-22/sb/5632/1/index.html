<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington's water infrastructure is inadequate to meet the needs of fish, families, and employers due to age, design limitations, and a shortage of storage capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds the lack of a secure water supply and adequate infrastructure exacerbates natural disasters, such as flooding and drought, and that Washington's rivers, lakes, and streams are threatened by pollution from existing development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, with this act, will make a historic $5,000,000,000 investment in critical water infrastructure projects using available federal funds and dedicating a constant portion of the omnibus capital appropriations act for water infrastructure needs. It is the intent of the legislature to enhance water security for the diverse inhabitants of Washington by making fiscally responsible investments in infrastructure projects that: Promote increased availability of water for out-of-stream beneficial uses; reduce the risk of flooding, protect against damage that may be caused by flooding, and restore areas where flooding has occurred; improve fish passage; and reduce stormwater pollution from existing development.</p>
