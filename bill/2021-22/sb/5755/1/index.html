<h2 id="section-1-3244">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-3244">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many cities in Washington are actively planning for growth under the growth management act, chapter 36.70A RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The construction industry provides living wage jobs for families across Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the current economic climate, the creation of additional affordable housing units is essential to the economic health of our cities and our state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is critical that Washington state promote its cities and its property owners that will provide affordable housing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A meaningful, fair, and predictable economic incentive should be created to stimulate the redevelopment of vacant or underdeveloped property in targeted urban areas through a limited sales and use tax deferral program as provided by this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This limited tax deferral will help the owners of vacant or undeveloped property achieve the highest and best use of land and enable cities to more fully realize their planning goals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2-2626">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-2626">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to encourage the redevelopment of vacant or undeveloped land in targeted urban areas, thereby increasing affordable housing, employment opportunities, and helping accomplish the other planning goals of Washington cities. The legislative authorities of cities to which this chapter applies may authorize a sales and use tax deferral for an investment project within the city if the legislative authority of the city finds that there are both significant areas of vacant or undeveloped land and a lack of affordable housing in areas proximate to the vacant or undeveloped land. If a conditional recipient maintains the property for qualifying purposes for at least 10 years, deferred sales and use taxes need not be repaid.</p>
