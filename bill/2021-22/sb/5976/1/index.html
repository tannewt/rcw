</li>
<li>
<p>A petition for substance use disorder intervention shall consist of a written notification to the court alleging that the individual has one or more violations for possession of a controlled substance; the person is believed to have a substance use disorder; actions taken so far have been unsuccessful in addressing the individual's substance use disorder; and court intervention and supervision are necessary to assist the entity in addressing the individual's substance use disorder. The petition shall set forth facts that support the allegations in this section, including prior referrals or violations, as well as the current violation.</p>

<li>
<p>Petitions filed under this section may be served by certified mail, return receipt requested.
