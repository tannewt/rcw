<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that it has required every public school to provide comprehensive sexual health education to each student by the 2022-23 school year. The legislature further recognizes that it allows parents to excuse their children from this instruction by filing a written request with the school district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of being subject to the broad discretion of school districts and the state, the legislature intends to give parents more control and choice over the sexual health education their child receives by having parents provide written approval before any planned instruction occurs.</p>
