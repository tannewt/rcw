<p>The legislature finds that the elimination of polling places resulting from the transition to vote by mail creates barriers that restrict the ability of many voters with disabilities from achieving the independence and privacy in voting provided by the accessible voting devices required under the help America vote act.

The committee shall assist election officials in developing a plan to identify and implement changes to improve the accessibility of elections for voters with disabilities. The plan shall include recommendations for the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The number of voting centers that will be maintained in order to ensure that people with disabilities have reasonable access to accessible voting devices, and a written explanation for how the determination was made;</p>
</li>

<p>The locations of ballot drop-off facilities, voting centers, and other election-related functions necessary to maximize accessibility to persons with disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outreach to voters with disabilities on the availability of disability accommodation, including in-person disability access voting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transportation of voting devices to locations convenient for voters with disabilities in order to ensure reasonable access for voters with disabilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of the provisions of the help America vote act related to persons with disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>Counties must update the plan at least annually. The election review staff of the secretary of state shall review and evaluate the plan in conformance with the review procedure identified in RCW 29A.04.570.</p>

Each city, town, or district must be promptly notified by the county treasurer whenever such transfer has been completed. However, in those districts wherein a treasurer, other than the county treasurer, has been appointed such transfer procedure does not apply, but the district shall promptly issue its warrant for payment of election costs.

The petitioner shall include in the petition, an explanation of the reasons why the initial decision is incorrect and certification should be granted, and may include a request for a hearing on the matter.
