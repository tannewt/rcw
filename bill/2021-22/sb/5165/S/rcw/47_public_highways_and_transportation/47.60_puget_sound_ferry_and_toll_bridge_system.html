<p>The department is authorized to acquire by lease, charter, contract, purchase, condemnation, or construction, and partly by any or all of such means, and to thereafter operate, improve, and extend, a system of ferries on and crossing Puget Sound and any of its tributary waters and connections thereof, and connecting with the public streets and highways in the state. However, any new vessel planning, construction, purchase, analysis, or design work must be consistent with RCW 47.60.810. The system of ferries shall include such boats, vessels, wharves, docks, approaches, landings, franchises, licenses, and appurtenances as shall be determined by the department to be necessary or desirable for efficient operation of the ferry system and best serve the public. Subject to RCW 47.56.820, the department may in like manner acquire by purchase, condemnation, or construction and include in the ferry system such toll bridges, approaches, and connecting roadways as may be deemed by the department advantageous in channeling traffic to points served by the ferry system. In addition to the powers of acquisition granted by this section, the department is empowered to enter into any contracts, agreements, or leases with any person, firm, or corporation and to thereby provide, on such terms and conditions as it shall determine, for the operation of any ferry or ferries or system thereof, whether acquired by the department or not.</p>

<p>For the purpose of carrying out any or all of the powers granted in this chapter, the department has the power of eminent domain for the acquisition of either real or personal property, used or useful for the Puget Sound ferry system. Condemnation pursuant to this chapter shall be the procedure set out in chapter 8.04 RCW. The department may institute condemnation proceedings in the superior court of any county or other court of competent jurisdiction in which any of the property sought to be condemned is located or in which the owner of any thereof does business, and the court in any such action has jurisdiction to condemn property wherever located within the state. It shall not be necessary to allege or prove any offer to purchase or inability to agree with the owners thereof for the purchase of any such property in the proceedings. It is the intention of this section to permit the consolidation in one action of all condemnation proceedings necessary to acquire a ferry system and every type of property incident thereto, irrespective of its location within the state or diversity of ownership. Upon the filing of a petition for condemnation as provided in this section, the court may issue an order restraining the removal from the jurisdiction of the state of any personal property sought to be acquired by the proceeding during the pendency thereof. The court further has the power to issue such orders or process as are necessary to place the department into possession of any property condemned.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent with the policy as established in subsection (1) of this section, the chief executive officer of the Washington State Ferries may approve agreements for the chartering of Washington State Ferry vessels to groups or individuals, including hazardous material transporters, in accordance with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Vessels may be committed to charter only when established route operation and normal user requirements are not disrupted or inconvenienced. If a vessel is engaged in the transport of hazardous materials, the transporter shall pay for all legs necessary to complete the charter, even if the vessel is simultaneously engaged in an operational voyage on behalf of Washington State Ferries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charter rates for vessels must be established at actual vessel operating costs plus a market-rate profit margin. Actual vessel operating costs include, but are not limited to, all labor, fuel, and vessel maintenance costs incurred due to the charter agreement, including deadheading and standby.</p>

The department has full charge of the construction, rehabilitation, rebuilding, enlarging, improving, operation, and maintenance of the ferry system, including toll bridges, approaches, and roadways incidental thereto that may be authorized by the department, including the collection of tolls and other charges for the services and facilities of the undertaking. The department has the exclusive right to enter into leases and contracts for use and occupancy by other parties of the concessions and space located on the ferries, wharves, docks, approaches, parking lots, and landings, including the selling of commercial advertising space and licenses to use the Washington State Ferries trademarks, but, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no such leases or contracts may be entered into for more than ten years, nor without a competitive contract process, except as otherwise provided in this section. The competitive process shall be either an invitation for bids in accordance with the process established by chapter 43.19 RCW, or a request for proposals in accordance with the process established by RCW 47.56.030. All revenues from commercial advertising, concessions, parking, leases, and contracts must be deposited in the Puget Sound ferry operations account in accordance with *RCW 47.60.150.</p>

Any lease entered into as provided for in this subsection that involves state aquatic lands shall conform with the Washington state Constitution and applicable statutory requirements as determined by the department of natural resources. That portion of the lease rate attributable to the state aquatic lands shall be distributed in the same manner as other lease revenues derived from state aquatic lands as provided in **RCW 79.24.580.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall include in the strategic planning and performance assessment process, as required by RCW 43.88.090, an analysis of the compatibility of public and private partnerships with the state ferry system's core business, and the department's efforts to maximize nonfarebox revenues and provide benefit to the public users of the ferry system facilities. The department shall include an assessment of the need for an open solicitation to identify and select possible public or private partnerships in order to maximize the value of projects and the state's investment in current and future ferry system operations.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When the department determines that an open solicitation is necessary, a request for proposal shall be released, consisting of an open solicitation outlining functional specifications to be used as the basis for selecting partnerships in the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any responses to the request for proposal shall be evaluated, at a minimum, on the basis of compatibility with the state ferry system's core business, potential to maximize nonfarebox revenue, longevity of the possible partnership commitment, and benefit to the public users of the ferry system facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no responses are received, or those that are received are incompatible with ferry system operations, or do not meet the criteria stated in (b) of this subsection, the state ferry system may proceed with state ferry system operating strategies designed to achieve state ferry system objectives without established partnerships.</p>

<p>Phase three consists of the submittal and evaluation of bids and the award of the contract to the successful proposer for the final design and construction of the auto ferries, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall request bids for detailed design and construction of the vessels after completion of the review of technical proposals in phase two. The department will review detailed design drawings in phase three for conformity with the technical proposals submitted in phase two.

<p>If at any point there is only a single best-qualified proposer participating in the competitive design-build procurement process prior to the submission of bids in phase three, or if there is only a single responsive and responsible bid submitted in phase three, or if the current best-qualified proposers elect to jointly submit a single proposal, the department may negotiate a fair-value contract with the proposer or joint proposers. The negotiations may consider the scope of work as well as contract price. The contract price must be established between the department and the proposer through negotiation based on detailed cost and price information provided by the proposer, the department, and other relevant sources in a format as determined by the department. To achieve efficiencies, the department may negotiate incentives and economic cost sharing between the state and the proposer. In addition to the cost incentives, other incentives may be considered, as determined by the department, to be in the best interests of the state. Such incentives may include, but are not limited to, key schedule milestones, technological innovations, performance efficiencies, constructability, and operational value or life-cycle cost. The department may issue guidelines, requirements, and procedures for all negotiations.</p>
<p>If the department conducts negotiations with a single remaining proposer or joint proposers prior to the submission of bids in phase three, all negotiations must be completed within forty-five days of the department's approval of the final technical proposal. If the department conducts negotiations with a single responsive and responsible phase three bidder, all negotiations must be completed within thirty days of submission of the phase three bids.</p>
<p>If the department reaches an agreement with the proposer or joint proposers, the department shall submit a copy of the contract, the final negotiated price, and supporting information to the office of financial management at least ten days prior to execution of the contract. If the final negotiated price is greater than the legislature's adopted expenditure plan for vessel construction, the department may not execute the contract until the legislature reviews the final proposals and adjusts the expenditure plan accordingly.</p>
<p>If the department is unable within the designated time period to reach an agreement with the proposer or joint proposers that is fair, reasonable, and in the department's budget, or if the proposers initially provide notice of their intent to jointly submit a single proposal but fail to do so, or if any one of the proposers withdraws from a jointly submitted single proposal before entering into a contract with the department, or if both of the current best-qualified proposers withdraw or otherwise fail to proceed with the request for proposals process, the department may issue a new request for proposals or cancel the request for proposals process, to serve the best interests of the state.</p>
<p>The department may pay an honorarium in a specified amount determined by the department to a proposer or joint proposers who has [have] submitted a final, approved technical proposal and with whom the department has engaged in unsuccessful negotiations. The proposer or joint proposers shall not receive any other compensation for attempting to negotiate a contract, except to the extent allowed by the department in a final contract awarded pursuant to the request for proposal.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the Washington state ferry system has an excellent safety record and has commenced a long-term vessel procurement plan to ensure the replacement of older and outdated ferry vessels. The legislature further finds that the current vessel procurement process must move forward with all due speed, balancing the interests of both the taxpayers and shipyards. The commencement of construction of new vessels is important not only for safety reasons, but also to keep skilled marine construction jobs in the Puget Sound region and to sustain the capacity of the region to meet the ongoing preservation needs of the ferry system fleet of vessels.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the balancing of interests described in this section may necessitate the department of transportation to consider in the department's current new 144—auto ferries request for proposals a single proposal submitted jointly by the current best-qualified proposers. The department may, therefore, consider and accept or reject in the department's discretion such a single proposal, and the current best-qualified proposers may meet and confer to discuss matters that are reasonably necessary to determine whether to submit such a single proposal and to implement a single final contract if the proposal is accepted by the department. Discussions may address the terms of any agreement that may be entered into between the best-qualified proposers for purposes of submitting a single proposal, as well as any agreement that may be entered into with the department. Discussions may also address cost and price information and division of work under the request for proposals. The current best-qualified proposers shall each expressly declare in writing to the department, their intent, if any, to jointly submit a single proposal within thirty days of May 14, 2007, and shall further provide within the thirty-day period information that may be required by the department including, but not limited to, information regarding the proposed shipyard organizational structure and responsibilities of each participant. If at the end of the thirty-day period the proposers have not declared such an intent and provided the information required by the department, or if the department, in its discretion, determines that the joint venture, other legal entity, or organizational structure, or division of responsibilities intended by the joint proposers are unacceptable and not in the best interests of the state, the proposers will be deemed as proposing separately to the request for proposals, and further discussions related to the request for proposals shall not be allowed between the proposers.</p>
<p>To further facilitate the balancing of interests described in this section, the department of transportation may, in its discretion, make revisions to the request for proposals that the department deems necessary or appropriate to balance such interests.</p>

<p>In performing the function of operating its ferry system, the department may, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose and after consultation with the department of enterprise services, explore and implement strategies designed to reduce the overall cost of fuel and mitigate the impact of market fluctuations and pressure on both short-term and long-term fuel costs. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, futures contracts, hedging, swap transactions, option contracts, costless collars, and long-term storage. The department shall periodically submit a report to the transportation committees of the legislature and the department of enterprise services on the status of any such implemented strategies, including cost mitigation results, a description of each contract established to mitigate fuel costs, the amounts of fuel covered by the contracts, the cost mitigation results, and any related recommendations. The first report must be submitted within one year of implementation.</p>

<li>
<p>To increase small business participation in ferry vessel procurement, the Washington state department of transportation's office of equal opportunity shall develop and monitor a state small business enterprise enforceable goals program. Pursuant to this program, the office shall establish contract goals for ferry vessel procurement. The contract goal is defined as a percentage of the contract award amount that the prime contractor must meet by subcontracting with small business enterprises. The enforceable goal for all ferry vessel procurement contracts will be set by the office. Prime contractors unable to meet the enforceable goal must submit evidence of good faith efforts to meet the contract goal to the small business enterprise enforceable goals program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small business enterprises intending to benefit from the small business enterprise enforceable goals program established in subsection (1) of this section must meet the definition of &quot;small business&quot; in RCW 39.26.010. Prime contractors will enter all subcontractor payments into the office's diversity management and compliance system. The office of equal opportunity shall monitor program performance.</p>
