<p>The transportation budget is currently reliant on vehicle and driver related fees. Motor vehicle registrations, driver licenses, tolls, and the motor vehicle fuel tax provide the primary revenues for the transportation budget. These user revenues no longer adequately support the transportation system's needs. Many of the transportation modes have no or little ability to generate revenue, yet are important elements of a functioning transportation network. Providing transportation options that do not involve passenger vehicles is critical. The tax burden in the transportation budget falls on people that own and drive vehicles. It fails to provide the money needed for the system quality that the people of Washington want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the commission is directed to evaluate, identify, and consider agencies, programs, and activities that are currently funded in the transportation budget that provide a public good that might be paid for using other revenues. The commission is directed to make recommendations for potential changes to funding sources for the transportation system with the goal of providing funding to maintain existing transportation assets in a state of good repair without exclusively relying on vehicle owners or drivers as the revenue source. Preliminary findings must be presented to the Joint Transportation Committee by September 30, 2022, and a final report issued to the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1, 2022.</p>

This reimbursement to the motor vehicle fund is intended to address any possibility that the termination of this agreement could be determined to result in the unconstitutional use of 18th amendment designated funds for nonhighway purposes under the constitution of the state of Washington; however, this transfer is not intended to indicate that the incidental use of this infrastructure by these properties necessarily requires such reimbursement under the state Constitution.

In 2019 the legislature amended RCW 47.60.810 to direct the department to modify an existing vessel construction contract to provide for an additional five ferries. As such, it is the intent of the legislature that the department award the contract for the hybrid electric Olympic class vessel #5(L2000329) in a timely manner. In addition, the legislature intends to minimize costs and maximize construction efficiency by providing sufficient funding for construction of all five vessels, including funding for long lead time materials procured at the lowest possible prices. The commencement of construction of new vessels for the ferry system is important not only for safety reasons, but also to keep skilled marine construction jobs in the Puget Sound region and to sustain the capacity of the region to meet the ongoing construction and preservation needs of the ferry system fleet of vessels. The legislature has determined that the current vessel procurement process must move forward with all due speed, balancing the interests of both the taxpayers and shipyards. To accomplish construction of vessels in accordance with RCW 47.60.810, the prevailing shipbuilder, for vessels initially funded after July 1, 2020, is encouraged to follow the historical practice of subcontracting the construction of ferry superstructures to a separate nonaffiliated contractor located within the Puget Sound region, that is qualified in accordance with RCW 47.60.690.</p>

<p>The 2005 transportation partnership projects or improvements and 2015 connecting Washington projects or improvements are listed in the LEAP Transportation Document 2021-1 as developed April 23, 2021, which consists of a list of specific projects by fund source and amount over a sixteen-year period. Current fiscal biennium funding for each project is a line-item appropriation, while the outer year funding allocations represent a sixteen-year plan. The department of transportation is expected to use the flexibility provided in this section to assist in the delivery and completion of all transportation partnership account and connecting Washington account projects on the LEAP transportation document referenced in this subsection. For the 2021-2023 project appropriations, unless otherwise provided in this act, the director of the office of financial management may provide written authorization for a transfer of appropriation authority between projects funded with transportation partnership account appropriations or connecting Washington account appropriations to manage project spending and efficiently deliver all projects in the respective program under the following conditions and limitations:</p>
