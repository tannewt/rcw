</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary's allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust, and an exercise of the power which produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this chapter does not create an inference that the fiduciary abused the fiduciary's discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Add a receipt to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the receipt between income and principal; and</p>

<p>If the court determines that a fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order a remedy authorized by law.

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>On petition by a fiduciary for instruction, the court may determine whether a proposed fiduciary decision will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed decision, contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiary of the reasons for making the proposed decision and the facts on which the fiduciary relies, and explains how the beneficiary will be affected by the proposed decision, a beneficiary that opposes the proposed decision has the burden to establish that it will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.</p>
