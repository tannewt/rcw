# Senate Bill 5986

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5986.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that homelessness has increased in Washington, and most of the current expenditures to address homelessness are not reducing homelessness but are in fact increasing homelessness. Homelessness is exacerbated by housing and environmental government policies that result in the lack of available and affordable housing and an increase in rents and increased costs and effectively reducing incomes making housing more difficult. In addition, homelessness is often caused by complex and long-term behavioral health conditions, substance addiction, or disabilities, or as a result of domestic violence. Every night, thousands of Washingtonians go to sleep in places not meant for human habitation, such as cars, parks, sidewalks, abandoned buildings, and spaces on public land. The legislature finds that current policies to address homelessness in Washington are inadequate and must be addressed. The provision of mental health and substance abuse treatment options must be part of the solution. Cities and counties are struggling to cope with unauthorized camping and its negative environmental and social impacts. The legislature intends that persons experiencing homelessness be treated with dignity, care, and compassion. The legislature recognizes that Washingtonians have compassion for the homeless, but also expect that the homeless be required to take advantage of mental health and substance abuse treatment options and that those physically able should provide either a portion of their limited income or community service to repay taxpayers.

## Section 6
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 7 and 8, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (sections 7 and 8 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a) and (c).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage the employment of certain unemployed persons, such as persons convicted of a felony and homeless persons. It is the legislature's intent to provide employers a credit against the business and occupation tax or public utility tax for hiring certain unemployed persons which would reduce an employer's tax burden thereby inducing employers to hire and create jobs for such persons. Pursuant to chapter 43.136 RCW, the joint legislative audit and review committee must review the business and occupation tax and public utility tax credit established under sections 7 and 8, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (sections 7 and 8 of this act) by December 31, 2031.

4. If a review finds that the number of unemployed persons who meet the criteria in section 7(7)(c)(i) or 8(7)(c)(i) of this act decreased by 30 percent, then the legislature intends for the legislative auditor to recommend extending the expiration date of the tax preference.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee should refer to unemployment rates available from the employment security department and the bureau of labor statistics.
