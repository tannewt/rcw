<p>The legislature finds that management of organic waste is an essential component of the state's solid waste management system. Proper management of organic waste provides many environmental and economic benefits to the state, local governments, residents, and businesses. Composting, anaerobic digestion, and other forms of organic waste management can mitigate climate change by reducing our carbon footprint through increased carbon sequestration, when compost or recycled organic materials are applied to soil systems, and through the useful diversion of organic waste from landfills, where the waste would otherwise produce carbon intensive methane emissions. This diversion of organic waste creates a savings in space for landfills that are already overstressed by the current demand for waste disposal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, recycling of organic waste contributes to a circular economy by eliminating waste, keeping local products and material in use, and regenerating natural systems. Compost and other recycled organic waste products also enrich soil, improve soil structure, and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, providing beneficial applications in agriculture, postconstruction soil conditioning, infrastructure projects, horticulture, stormwater filtration, and erosion control.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that interpretation and implementation of permitting requirements for organic waste processors across the state can vary among local jurisdictions. This and other siting requirements can cause barriers to the establishment of new composting facilities and the expansion of existing compost facilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a statewide organic waste management goal to be accomplished over the next decade in order to promote the reduction of organic waste resources going to landfills, the diversification of how organic waste is managed, the identification of technologies and methods for carbon sequestration, and the comprehensive use of compost and other recycled organic waste products by state and local governments, residents, and businesses to facilitate the growth of organic waste processing statewide.</p>
