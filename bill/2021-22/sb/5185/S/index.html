<p>Informed consent for health care for a patient who <strong>does not have the capacity to make a health care decision</strong> may be obtained from a person authorized to consent on behalf of such patient. <strong>For purposes of this section, a person who is of the age of consent to make a particular health care decision is presumed to have capacity, unless a health care provider reasonably determines the person lacks capacity to make the health care decision due to the person's demonstrated inability to understand and appreciate the nature and consequences of a health condition, the proposed treatment, including the anticipated results, benefits, risks, and alternatives to the proposed treatment, including nontreatment, and reach an informed decision as a result of cognitive impairment; and the health care provider documents the basis for the determination in the medical record. An adult person is presumed not to have the capacity to make a health care decision if the person is subject to a guardianship that includes health care decision making under RCW 11.130.265.</strong></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Persons authorized to provide informed consent to health care on behalf of <strong>an adult</strong> patient who <strong>does not have the capacity to make a health care decision</strong> shall be a member of one of the following classes of persons in the following order of priority:</p>

<p>The appointed guardian of the patient, if any;</p>

<li>
<p>Children of the patient who are at least eighteen years of age;</p>

<p>(II) Is familiar with the patient's personal values;</p>
<p>(III) Is reasonably available to make health care decisions;</p>
<p>(IV) Is not any of the following: A physician to the patient or an employee of the physician; the owner, administrator, or employee of a health care facility, nursing home, or long-term care facility where the patient resides or receives care; or a person who receives compensation to provide care to the patient; and</p>
<p>(V) Provides a declaration under (a)(x)(B) of this subsection.</p>
<p>(B) An adult who meets the requirements of (a)(x)(A) of this subsection shall provide a declaration, which is effective for up to six months from the date of the declaration, signed and dated under penalty of perjury pursuant to chapter 5.50 RCW, that recites facts and circumstances demonstrating that he or she is familiar with the patient and that he or she:</p>
<p>(I) Meets the requirements of (a)(x)(A) of this subsection;</p>
<p>(II) Is a close friend of the patient;</p>
<p>(III) Is willing and able to become involved in the patient's health care;</p>

<p>(V) Is not aware of a person in a higher priority class willing and able to provide informed consent to health care on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>(C) A health care provider may, but is not required to, rely on a declaration provided under (a)(x)(B) of this subsection. The health care provider or health care facility where services are rendered is immune from suit in any action, civil or criminal, or from professional or other disciplinary action when such reliance is based on a declaration provided in compliance with (a)(x)(B) of this subsection.</p>
<pre><code>b. If the health care provider seeking informed consent for proposed health care of the patient who **does not have the capacity to make a particular health care decision, other than a person who is under the age of consent for the particular health care decision,** makes reasonable efforts to locate and secure authorization from a competent person in the first or succeeding class and finds no such person available, authorization may be given by any person in the next class in the order of descending priority. However, no person under this section may provide informed consent to health care:

    i. If a person of higher priority under this section has refused to give such authorization; or

    ii. If there are two or more individuals in the same class and the decision is not unanimous among all available members of that class.

c. Before any person authorized to provide informed consent on behalf of a patient who **does not have the capacity to make a health care decision** exercises that authority, the person must first determine in good faith that that patient, if **he or she had the capacity to make the health care decision**, would consent to the proposed health care. If such a determination cannot be made, the decision to consent to the proposed health care may be made only after determining that the proposed health care is in the patient's best interests. **This subsection (1)(c) does not apply to informed consent provided on behalf of a patient who has not reached the age of consent required to make a particular health care decision.**

d. No rights under Washington's death with dignity act, chapter 70.245 RCW, may be exercised through a person authorized to provide informed consent to health care on behalf of a patient who **does not have the capacity to make a health care decision**.

d. A health care facility or a health care provider may, in its discretion, require documentation of a person's claimed status as being a relative responsible for the health care of the minor patient, or a person claiming to be authorized to consent to the health care of the minor patient under (b) of this subsection. However, there is no obligation to require such documentation.

e. The health care provider or health care facility where services are rendered shall be immune from suit in any action, civil or criminal, or from professional or other disciplinary action when such reliance is based on a declaration signed under penalty of perjury pursuant to chapter 5.50 RCW stating that the adult person is a relative responsible for the health care of the minor patient under (a)(v) of this subsection, or a person claiming to be authorized to consent to the health care of the minor patient under (b) of this subsection.
