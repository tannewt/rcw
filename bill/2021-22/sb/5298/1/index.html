<h2 id="section-1-1593">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-1593">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that self-determination is core to tribal sovereignty and must be integral in decision making that affects a tribe, tribal lands, or tribal rights. The legislature also finds that it is a priority to continue to strengthen the government-to-government relationship established between tribes and the state. As such, the legislature affirms that establishing notice and consent requirements between the attorney general and tribes is an important step toward furthering those goals.</p>

<li>
<p>Prior to proposing legislation that if passed would affect tribes, tribal rights, or tribal lands;</p>

<h2 id="section-4-736">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-736">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The attorney general shall not initiate any project or program, undertaken under the independent authority of the attorney general, that affects a tribe, tribal rights, or tribal lands without receiving consent from that tribe except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not apply to and consent will not be sought where doing so would be in conflict with the attorney general's statutory duties as legal counsel to state officials, agencies, departments, boards, and commissions and as legal representative for the state. Situations where consent will not be sought include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Actions on behalf of any other entity in the attorney general's role as legal counsel to state officials, agencies, departments, boards, and commissions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions related to the statutory duties and functions of the attorney general, including but not limited to issuing legal opinions and formulating ballot titles for state initiatives or referendum measures; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigations, litigation, employment, and other internal business decisions, or in circumstances where a failure to act may subject the attorney general to sanction from a court or would be in conflict with the rules of professional conduct for attorneys or chapter 42.52 RCW and the rules adopted and opinions issued under that chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter requires consensus among tribes. Where an action affects more than one tribe, the attorney general shall seek consent from all affected tribes through the process in subsection (4) of this section. In the absence of consent of any affected tribes, the attorney general shall request consultation with all affected tribes. If, after consultation in good faith, consent of all impacted tribes cannot be achieved, the attorney general may proceed with the action.</p>

<p>A request for consent by the attorney general is initiated by sending a written request to the chair of the tribe's governing body or designated representative, with a copy sent to each member of the tribe's governing body. The request must include information about the program or project and describe its potential impact to the tribe and any relevant timelines that require consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a tribe responds to a request for consent by objecting to the project or program, the attorney general may request consultation with the tribe to see if issues raised by the tribe can be addressed or resolved.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The attorney general may adopt rules to establish procedures to implement sections 2 through 5 of this act. The attorney general will seek input from tribes on rule making under this section. In addition to the procedures required in chapter 34.05 RCW, tribes or the attorney general may request consultation regarding concerns arising from the rule-making process.</p>
