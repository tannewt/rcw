[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5898.PL.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the importance of transportation electrification and the need to maintain stable funding for highway bonds as the use of carbon intensive motor fuels within the state is reduced. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to supplement certain existing highway bond authorization acts to prepare for and respond to changes in revenue derived from state excise taxes on fuel by providing an additional pledge of vehicle-related fees for highway bonds issued or refunded subsequent to the effective date of this section and providing funding from vehicle-related fees for bond retirement and interest on such highway bonds.

Any payments for bond retirement or interest on the bonds taken from other revenues from the **vehicle-related fees or** motor vehicle fuel or special fuel taxes that are distributable to the state, counties, cities and towns, shall be repaid from the first revenues from the motor vehicle fuel or special fuel taxes distributed to the special category C account **or vehicle-related fees** not required for bond retirement or interest on the bonds.
