<p>Upon request being made by the transportation commission, the state finance committee shall supervise and provide for the issuance, sale, and retirement of the bonds authorized by RCW 47.10.790 in accordance with the provisions of chapter 39.42 RCW. The amount of such bonds issued and sold under the provisions of RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798 in any biennium may not exceed the amount of a specific appropriation therefor. Such bonds may be sold from time to time in such amounts as may be necessary for the orderly progress of the state highway improvements specified in RCW 47.10.790. The bonds shall be sold in such manner, at such time or times, in such amounts, and at such price or prices as the state finance committee shall determine. The state finance committee may obtain insurance, letters of credit, or other credit facility devices with respect to the bonds and may authorize the execution and delivery of agreements, promissory notes, and other obligations for the purpose of insuring the payment or enhancing the marketability of the bonds. Promissory notes or other obligations issued under this section shall not constitute a debt or the contracting of indebtedness under any constitutional or statutory indebtedness limitation if their payment is conditioned upon the failure of the state to pay the principal of or interest on the bonds with respect to which the promissory notes or other obligations relate. The state finance committee may authorize the issuance of short-term obligations in lieu of long-term obligations for the purposes of more favorable interest rates, lower total interest costs, and increased marketability and for the purposes of retiring the bonds during the life of the project for which they were issued.</p>

The principal of and interest on such bonds must be first payable in the manner provided in RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798 from the proceeds of the state excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels imposed by chapter 82.38 RCW. Proceeds of such excise taxes are hereby pledged to the payment of any bonds and the interest thereon issued under the provisions of RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798, and the legislature hereby agrees to continue to impose the same excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels in amounts sufficient to pay, when due, the principal and interest on all bonds issued under the provisions of RCW 47.10.790 through 47.10.798.</p>

<p>For the purposes of chapter 498, Laws of 2009, chapter 377, Laws of 2011, and chapter 421, Laws of 2019, &quot;toll revenue&quot; means all toll receipts, all interest income derived from the investment of toll receipts, and any gifts, grants, or other funds received for the benefit of transportation facilities in the state, including eligible toll facilities. However, for the purpose of any pledge of toll revenue to the payment of particular bonds issued under chapter 498, Laws of 2009, chapter 377, Laws of 2011, and chapter 421, Laws of 2019, &quot;toll revenue&quot; means and includes only such toll revenue or portion thereof that is pledged to the payment of those bonds in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds. Toll revenue constitutes &quot;fees and revenues derived from the ownership or operation of any undertaking, facility, or project&quot; as that phrase is used in Article VIII, section 1(c)(1) of the state Constitution.</p>

<p>For the purposes of chapter 498, Laws of 2009, chapter 377, Laws of 2011, and chapter 421, Laws of 2019, &quot;tolling authority&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 47.56.810.</p>
