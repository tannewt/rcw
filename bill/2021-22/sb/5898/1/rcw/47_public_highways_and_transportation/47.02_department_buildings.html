<p>Bonds issued under the authority of RCW 47.02.120 through 47.02.190 must distinctly state that they are a general obligation of the state of Washington, must pledge the full faith and credit of the state to the payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, and must contain an unconditional promise to pay such principal and interest as the same becomes due. The principal and interest on the bonds must be first payable in the manner provided in RCW 47.02.120 through 47.02.190 from the proceeds of the state excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels imposed by chapter 82.38 RCW <strong>and vehicle-related fees</strong>. Proceeds of such excise taxes <strong>and vehicle-related fees</strong> are hereby pledged to the payment of any bonds and the interest thereon issued under the authority of RCW 47.02.120 through 47.02.190, and the legislature agrees to continue to impose these excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels <strong>and vehicle-related fees</strong> in amounts sufficient to pay, when due, the principal and interest on all bonds issued under the authority of RCW 47.02.120 through 47.02.190.</p>

<p>Both principal and interest on the bonds issued for the purposes of RCW 47.02.120 through 47.02.190 shall be payable from the highway bond retirement fund. The state finance committee may provide that a special account be created in the fund to facilitate payment of the principal and interest. The state finance committee shall, on or before June 30th of each year, certify to the state treasurer the amount required for principal and interest on the bonds in accordance with the bond proceedings. The state treasurer shall withdraw revenues from the motor vehicle fund and deposit in the highway bond retirement fund, or a special account in the fund, such amounts, and at such times, as are required by the bond proceedings.</p>
<p>Any funds required for bond retirement or interest on the bonds authorized by RCW 47.02.120 through 47.02.190 shall be taken from that portion of the motor vehicle fund that results from the imposition of excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels <strong>and vehicle-related fees</strong> and that is distributed to the state under RCW 46.68.130. Funds required shall never constitute a charge against any other allocations of motor vehicle fuel and special fuel tax revenues <strong>and vehicle-related fees</strong> to the state, counties, cities, and towns unless the amount arising from excise taxes on motor vehicle and special fuels <strong>and vehicle-related fees</strong> distributed to the state under RCW 46.68.130 proves insufficient to meet the requirements for bond retirement or interest on any such bonds.</p>
