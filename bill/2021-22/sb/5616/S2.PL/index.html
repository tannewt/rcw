<ol>
<li>
<p>The water pollution control revolving administration account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from charges authorized in this section must be deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only in a manner consistent with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is authorized to assess administration charges as a portion of the debt service for loans issued under the water pollution control revolving fund created in RCW 90.50A.020. The sole purpose of assessing administration charges is to predictably and adequately fund the department's costs of administering the water pollution control revolving fund loan program, as identified in subsection (5) of this section. The department must assess administration charges on each water pollution control revolving fund loan at the point the loan enters repayment status, after July 28, 2013, and rule changes are adopted to implement the administration charge. Loans that are at an interest rate below the established administration charge rate are exempt from the administration charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The water pollution control revolving administration account consists of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any administration charge levied by the department in conjunction with administration of the water pollution control revolving fund; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other revenues derived from gifts, grants, or bequests pledged to the state for the purpose of administering the water pollution control revolving fund.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state treasurer may invest and reinvest moneys in the water pollution control revolving administration account in the manner provided by law. All earnings from such investment and reinvestment must be credited to the water pollution control revolving administration account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys in the water pollution control revolving administration account are to be used for the following water pollution control revolving fund loan program costs:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Administration costs associated with conducting application processes, managing contracts, collecting loan repayments, managing the revolving fund, providing technical assistance, and meeting state and federal reporting requirements; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information and data system costs associated with loan tracking and fund management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each biennium, the department may spend from the water pollution control revolving administration account an amount no greater than four percent of the water pollution control revolving fund new capital appropriation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For its 2017-2019 biennial operating budget submittal, and every biennium thereafter, the department must compare the projected water pollution control revolving administration account balance and the projected administration charge income with projected program costs, including an adequate working capital reserve as defined by the office of financial management. In its submittal to the office of financial management, the department may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Find that the projected administration charge income is inadequate to fund the cost of administering the program, and that the rate of the charge must be increased. However, the administration charge may never exceed one percent on the declining principal loan balance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find that the projected administration charge income exceeds what is needed to fund the cost of administering the program, and that the rate of the charge must be decreased;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find that there is an excess balance in the revolving administration account, and that the excess must be transferred to the water pollution control revolving fund to be used for loans; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find that there is no need for any rate adjustments or balance transfers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the point where the water pollution control revolving administration account adequately covers the program administration costs, the department may no longer use the federal administration allowance. If a federal capitalization grant is awarded after that point, all federal capitalization dollars must be used for making loans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2018, the department must submit to the appropriate legislative fiscal committees a report on implementation of the administration charge, including information on: The amount of income the administration charge has produced since its inception; the uses and adequacy of the income for administrative costs; any excess balances that have been transferred to the water pollution control revolving fund; and any additional sources that the department is using for program administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The</strong> legislature may direct the state treasurer to make transfers of moneys in the water pollution control revolving administration account to the water pollution control revolving fund.</p>
</li>
