<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the fashion industry has many negative environmental and social impacts, including high levels of water use, run-off pollution from the use of agrochemicals and dyes, carbon emissions, industry waste, low wages, hazardous work environments, and other unethical labor practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United Nations estimates that a single pair of jeans requires a kilogram of cotton, and because cotton tends to be grown in dry environments, producing this kilogram requires about 7,500 to 10,000 liters of water, which is approximately 10 years' worth of drinking water for one person. The industry accounts for nearly 20 percent of global wastewater, with fabric dyes polluting water bodies and impacting aquatic life and drinking water. Cotton production also uses a high amount of fertilizers and pesticides, discharging toxic substances to waterways. In terms of greenhouse gases, the fashion industry accounts for about eight to 10 percent of global carbon emissions, using more energy than both aviation and shipping combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The synthetic polymer polyester is the most common fabric used in clothing, and globally, 65 percent of the clothing that we wear is polymer-based. Around 70,000,000 barrels of oil a year are used to make polyester fibers in our clothes, from waterproof jackets to scarves. Polyester takes hundreds of years to decompose and can lead to microfibers escaping into the environment. The United States environmental protection agency estimates that in 2018, 11,300,000 tons of textiles ended up in landfills, while another 3,200,000 tons were incinerated. According to the Ellen MacArthur foundation, the average number of times a piece of clothing is worn decreased by 36 percent between 2000 and 2015, and according to the world bank, 40 percent of clothing purchased in some countries is never used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Garment workers face oppressive working conditions, cope with irregular hours, and receive low wages. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened these conditions when canceled orders and factory closures put millions of workers out of a job, leaving them unable to pay for basic needs such as food and rent. Female garment workers, who make up around 80 percent of the workforce, risk violence and sexual harassment. The international labor organization estimates that 160,000,000 children are engaged in child labor, with many working within the fashion supply chain, making textiles and garments. Farmworkers who work to produce cotton are exposed to high levels of pesticides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that some companies have committed to mitigation measures, such as the use of the science-based targets initiative, a tool for reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, legislation regarding due diligence is being considered in New York and the European Union, and Germany, France, Britain, and Australia have laws requiring due diligence when it comes to human rights and slavery. Therefore, the legislature also intends to address the negative environmental and social impacts of the fashion industry, by requiring companies to map a minimum of 50 percent of their supply chain, disclose where in that chain they have the greatest social and environmental impact when it comes to low wages, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, water, and chemical management, and make plans to reduce those numbers. By doing so, the legislature intends for Washington to serve as a leader in mitigating the environmental and social impact of the fashion industry.</p>
