<p>It is the intent of the legislature, over the first 5 years of the move ahead WA program, that $50,000,000 will be provided to the Seattle department of transportation (SDOT) to implement Aurora Avenue North Safety Improvements (L4000154). Under this program, SDOT will be required to implement strategic transportation investments for the Aurora Ave N Corridor from N 90th St to N 105th St that ensure slow vehicle speeds, walkability, multimodal mobility, safe routes to local schools, and safety for residents, which will demonstrate the benefits of similar transportation investments for other locations along Aurora Avenue and elsewhere. SDOT must convene a neighborhood oversight board consisting of residents of communities of the Aurora Ave N Corridor to prioritize investments and monitor project implementation. The oversight board should be composed of an equitable representation of local communities along the Aurora Ave N Corridor, including residents with disabilities. SDOT will ensure that the oversight board is consulted on a bimonthly basis during the prioritization process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends, upon completion of the State Route 99/Aurora Avenue North Planning Study, that projects recommended in the study will be funded by this program. A specific focus must be on access management to consolidate driveways and improve safety for vulnerable users. This work must also include installation of full curb and sidewalks to improve safety, mobility, transit ridership, equity, and work towards the goals set forth in vision zero, target zero, and the Washington state active transportation plan. SDOT must ensure the design and implementation of an accessible sidewalk network to support users with mobility limitations, convenient and accessible transit stops, all-ages-and-abilities bicycle facilities, and safe pedestrian-activated crosswalks that put safety over speed, balances the needs of different modes, reduces the level of traffic stress experienced by pedestrians and cyclists, connects to existing bicycle and transit networks, creates safe walking and bicycling routes to local schools including crosswalks, improves human and environmental health, and supports the surrounding neighborhoods. SDOT must coordinate with the Washington state department of transportation and King county metro in implementing the investments. SDOT must ensure that funds are maximized by limiting the percentage for planning, predesign, design, permitting, and environmental review to ten percent of the total cost of each project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that all Aurora Avenue North Safety Improvement projects funded in this program be completed by December 31, 2029, and that no funds may be expended for this purpose after this date.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that $14,000,000 will be provided for the Guemes Ferry Boat Replacement Project (L4000124).</p>
