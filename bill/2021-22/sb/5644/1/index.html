<h2 id="section-1-155">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-155">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that behavioral health co-response has experienced a surge in popularity in Washington state in the past five years. The legislature recognizes the importance of training for those involved in co-responder programs to promote high standards within programs and to enhance the skills of those already working in this field. The purpose of this act is to develop a core curriculum relevant to first responders and behavioral health professionals working on co-response teams, to create ongoing learning opportunities for emerging and established co-response programs, and to develop the workforce to fill future co-responder hiring needs.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-122">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-122">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/36_counties/36.028A_association_of_sheriffs_and_police_chiefs.html">36.28A</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/36_counties/36.028A_association_of_sheriffs_and_police_chiefs.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>

</li>
<li>
<p>Establish four to six learning sites in Washington state with structured learning components and areas of instruction where individuals interested in co-response can spend a day learning with an experienced co-response team;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partner with the department of health to develop a certification specific to behavioral health professionals working in the co-response field, including completion of a core curriculum, observation of programs, and completion of a specified number of hours of field work, for the purpose of raising standards for co-response programs, encouraging interest in co-response programs, and promoting workforce development; and</p>
</li>

<p>Report on progress and present workforce development recommendations specific to co-response programs to the governor and relevant committees of the legislature by June 30, 2023.</p>

<p>To accomplish these goals the association shall hire a co-response training coordinator with consultation and consent from the statewide organization of first responders, behavioral health professionals, and project managers working in co-response programs specified in subsection (1) of this section. The coordinator shall work closely with this statewide organization and consult with a spectrum of co-response programs and other relevant entities such as the Washington state firefighters' association and the department of health.</p>
