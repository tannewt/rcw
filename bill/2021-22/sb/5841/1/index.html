<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds the people of Washington have more reason to fear for their safety, with the incidence of violent crimes such as murder, rape, and aggravated assault reaching 25-year highs in the past few years, while the rate of property crime has ranked second highest in the nation over the past five years. The legislature also finds Washington ranks last in the nation for law enforcement officers per capita.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds the counties and cities of Washington should be served by a number of law enforcement officers at least equal to the national average per capita, and that law enforcement agencies should be encouraged to invest in innovative crime reduction efforts when possible. To avoid placing more burden on local governments and to promote equitable and consistent enforcement of laws among jurisdictions, it is therefore the intent of the legislature to provide a source of funding to support additional local investments in law enforcement and public safety, with the goal of reducing violent and property crime.</p>
