<h2 id="section-1-629">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-629">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that wild salmon populations have declined and that many populations are threatened and endangered. The legislature further finds that allowing the use of alternative fishing techniques that can reduce or eliminate impacts to threatened wild fish, while allowing for selective harvest of hatchery stocks, improves the recovery of wild fish and increases the opportunities to catch harvestable stocks. Therefore, the legislature finds that repealing provisions of Initiative 77 from 1934 that restricts the use of certain fishing gear will provide fisheries managers with additional options for managing the selective harvest of salmon stocks.</p>

<li>
<p>In addition to all other taxes, licenses, or fees provided by law there is established an excise tax on the commercial possession of enhanced food fish as provided in this chapter. The tax is levied upon and shall be collected from the owner of the enhanced food fish whose possession constitutes the taxable event. The taxable event is the first possession in Washington by an owner after the enhanced food fish has been landed. Processing and handling of enhanced food fish by a person who is not the owner is not a taxable event to the processor or handler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person in possession of enhanced food fish and liable to this tax may deduct from the price paid to the person from which the enhanced food fish (except oysters) are purchased an amount equal to a tax at one-half the rate levied in this section upon these products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The measure of the tax is the value of the enhanced food fish at the point of landing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax shall be equal to the measure of the tax multiplied by the rates for enhanced food fish as follows:</p>
<p>a.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Chinook, coho, and chum salmon and anadromous game fish: <strong>Seven</strong> percent;</p>
<pre><code>b. Pink and sockeye salmon: Three and fifteen one-hundredths percent;

c. Other food fish and shellfish, except oysters, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers: Two and one-tenth percent;

e. Sea urchins: Two and one-tenth percent; and

f. Sea cucumbers: Two and one-tenth percent.
