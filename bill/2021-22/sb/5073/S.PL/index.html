<li>
<p>The authority and each behavioral health administrative services organization or agency employing designated crisis responders shall publish information in an easily accessible format describing the process for an immediate family member, guardian, or conservator**, or a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such tribe,** to petition for court review of a detention decision under RCW 71.05.201.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A designated crisis responder or designated crisis responder agency that receives a request for investigation for possible detention under this chapter must inquire whether the request comes from an immediate family member, guardian, or conservator**, or a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such tribe,** who would be eligible to petition under RCW 71.05.201. If the designated crisis responder decides not to detain the person for evaluation and treatment under RCW 71.05.150 or 71.05.153 or forty-eight hours have elapsed since the request for investigation was received and the designated crisis responder has not taken action to have the person detained, the designated crisis responder or designated crisis responder agency must inform the immediate family member, guardian, or conservator**, or a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such tribe,** who made the request for investigation about the process to petition for court review under RCW 71.05.201 and, to the extent feasible, provide the immediate family member, guardian, or conservator**, or a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such tribe,** with written or electronic information about the petition process. <strong>Information provided to a federally recognized Indian tribe shall be sent to the tribal contact listed in the authority's tribal crisis coordination plan.</strong> If provision of written or electronic information is not feasible, the designated crisis responder or designated crisis responder agency must refer the immediate family member, guardian, or conservator**, or a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such tribe,** to a website where published information on the petition process may be accessed. The designated crisis responder or designated crisis responder agency must document the manner and date on which the information required under this subsection was provided to the immediate family member, guardian, or conservator**, or a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such tribe**.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A designated crisis responder or designated crisis responder agency must, upon request, disclose the date of a designated crisis responder investigation under this chapter to an immediate family member, guardian, or conservator**, or a federally recognized Indian tribe if the person is a member of such tribe,** of a person to assist in the preparation of a petition under RCW 71.05.201.</p>

<p>When, in the opinion of the superintendent or the professional person in charge of the hospital or facility providing involuntary treatment, the committed person can be appropriately served by outpatient treatment prior to or at the expiration of the period of commitment, then such outpatient care may be required as a term of conditional release for a period which, when <strong>combined with the number of days the person has spent in</strong> inpatient treatment , shall not exceed <strong>90 days if the underlying commitment was for a period of 14 or 90 days, or 180 days if the underlying commitment was for a period of 180 days</strong>. If the facility or agency designated to provide outpatient treatment is other than the facility providing involuntary treatment, the outpatient facility so designated must agree in writing to assume such responsibility. A copy of the terms of conditional release shall be given to the patient, the designated crisis responder in the county in which the patient is to receive outpatient treatment, and to the court of original commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before a person committed under grounds set forth in RCW 71.05.280(3) or 71.05.320(4)(c) is conditionally released under (a) of this subsection, the superintendent or professional person in charge of the hospital or facility providing involuntary treatment shall in writing notify the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the criminal charges against the committed person were dismissed, of the decision to conditionally release the person. Notice and a copy of the terms of conditional release shall be provided at least thirty days before the person is released from inpatient care. Within twenty days after receiving notice, the prosecuting attorney may petition the court in the county that issued the commitment order to hold a hearing to determine whether the person may be conditionally released and the terms of the conditional release. The prosecuting attorney shall provide a copy of the petition to the superintendent or professional person in charge of the hospital or facility providing involuntary treatment, the attorney, if any, and guardian or conservator of the committed person, and the court of original commitment. If the county in which the committed person is to receive outpatient treatment is the same county in which the criminal charges against the committed person were dismissed, then the court shall, upon the motion of the prosecuting attorney, transfer the proceeding to the court in that county. The court shall conduct a hearing on the petition within ten days of the filing of the petition. The committed person shall have the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as for an involuntary treatment proceeding, except as set forth in this subsection and except that there shall be no right to jury trial. The issue to be determined at the hearing is whether or not the person may be conditionally released without substantial danger to other persons, or substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security. If the court disapproves of the conditional release, it may do so only on the basis of substantial evidence. Pursuant to the determination of the court upon the hearing, the conditional release of the person shall be approved by the court on the same or modified conditions or the person shall be returned for involuntary treatment on an inpatient basis subject to release at the end of the period for which he or she was committed, or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>The facility or agency designated to provide outpatient care or the secretary of the department of social and health services may modify the conditions for continued release when such modification is in the best interest of the person. Notification of such changes shall be sent to all persons receiving a copy of the original conditions. Enforcement or revocation proceedings related to a conditional release  may occur as provided under RCW 71.05.590.</p>

<li>
<p>To counsel or advise the person as to their rights and responsibilities under the court order, and to offer appropriate incentives to motivate compliance;</p>

<p>To request a court hearing for review and modification of the court order. The request must be made to or by the court with jurisdiction over the order and specify the circumstances that give rise to the request and what modification is being sought. The county prosecutor shall assist the agency or facility in requesting this hearing and issuing an appropriate summons to the person.

<p>Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, the issues for the court to determine are whether: (i) The person adhered to the terms and conditions of the court order; (ii) substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred; (iii) there is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further inpatient treatment; or (iv) there is a likelihood of serious harm; and, if any of the above conditions apply, whether the court should reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative or conditional release  or order the person's detention for inpatient treatment. The person may waive the court hearing and allow the court to enter a stipulated order upon the agreement of all parties. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for fourteen days from the revocation hearing if the outpatient order was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.160 or 71.05.230. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the outpatient order was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.290 or 71.05.320, the number of days remaining on the outpatient order must be converted to days of inpatient treatment authorized in the original court order. A court may not issue an order to detain a person for inpatient treatment in a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program under this subsection unless there is a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program available and with adequate space for the person.</p>

<li>
<p>In determining whether or not to take action under this section the designated crisis responder, agency, or facility must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.212 and the court must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.245 as they apply to the question of whether to enforce, modify, or revoke a court order for involuntary treatment.</p>

A designated crisis responder or the secretary may, upon their own motion or notification by the facility or agency designated to provide outpatient care to a person subject to a less restrictive alternative treatment order under RCW 71.05.320 subsequent to an order for assisted outpatient behavioral health treatment entered under RCW 71.05.148, order the person to be apprehended and taken into custody and temporary detention for inpatient evaluation in an evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or in an approved substance use disorder treatment program, in or near the county in which he or she is receiving outpatient treatment. Proceedings under this subsection may be initiated without ordering the apprehension and detention of the person.</p>

<p>A person detained under this subsection may be held for evaluation for up to one hundred twenty hours, excluding weekends and holidays, pending a court hearing. If the person is not detained, the hearing must be scheduled within one hundred twenty hours of service on the person. The designated crisis responder or the secretary may modify or rescind the order at any time prior to commencement of the court hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issues for the court to determine are whether to continue the detention of the person for inpatient treatment or whether the court should reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative order or order the person's detention for inpatient treatment. To continue detention after the one hundred twenty hour period, the court must find that the person, as a result of a behavioral health disorder, presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled and, after considering less restrictive alternatives to involuntary detention and treatment, that no such alternatives are in the best interest of the person or others.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, the issues for the court to determine are whether: (i) The person adhered to the terms and conditions of the court order; (ii) substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred; (iii) there is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further inpatient treatment; or (iv) there is a likelihood of serious harm; and, if any of the above conditions apply, whether the court should reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative or conditional release  or order the person's detention for inpatient treatment. The person may waive the court hearing and allow the court to enter a stipulated order upon the agreement of all parties. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for fourteen days from the revocation hearing if the outpatient order was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.160 or 71.05.230. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the outpatient order was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.290 or 71.05.320, the number of days remaining on the outpatient order must be converted to days of inpatient treatment authorized in the original court order.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether or not to take action under this section the designated crisis responder, agency, or facility must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.212 and the court must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.245 as they apply to the question of whether to enforce, modify, or revoke a court order for involuntary treatment.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the current commitment is solely based on the person being in need of assisted outpatient behavioral health treatment as defined in RCW 71.05.020, a designated crisis responder may initiate inpatient detention procedures under RCW 71.05.150 or 71.05.153 when appropriate. A designated crisis responder or the secretary may, upon their own motion or notification by the facility or agency designated to provide outpatient care to a person subject to a less restrictive alternative treatment order under RCW 71.05.320 subsequent to an order for assisted outpatient behavioral health treatment entered under RCW 71.05.148, order the person to be apprehended and taken into custody and temporary detention for inpatient evaluation in an evaluation and treatment facility, in a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or in an approved substance use disorder treatment program, in or near the county in which he or she is receiving outpatient treatment. Proceedings under this subsection may be initiated without ordering the apprehension and detention of the person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person detained under this subsection may be held for evaluation for up to one hundred twenty hours, excluding weekends and holidays, pending a court hearing. The designated crisis responder or the secretary may modify or rescind the order at any time prior to commencement of the court hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issues for the court to determine are whether to continue the detention of the person for inpatient treatment or whether the court should reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative order or order the person's detention for inpatient treatment. To continue detention after the one hundred twenty hour period, the court must find that the person, as a result of a behavioral health disorder, presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled and, after considering less restrictive alternatives to involuntary detention and treatment, that no such alternatives are in the best interest of the person or others.</p>
