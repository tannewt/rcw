<h2 id="section-1-954">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-954">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that state data reporting requirements for hospitals are placing unwarranted burdens on the health care system during the national and state emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the legislature finds that a moratorium on state agencies imposing new data and information reporting obligations on hospitals, other than reporting necessary for COVID-19 pandemic patient care and vaccinations, is necessary to allow an assessment of current hospital reporting obligations. The legislature further finds that such an assessment must identify which hospital data reporting obligations need to be modified and whether collecting additional data or information fulfills legislative objectives.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-751">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-751">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section adds a new section to an existing chapter <a href="/rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.041_hospital_licensing_and_regulation.html">70.41</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.041_hospital_licensing_and_regulation.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until December 31, 2022, or the end of the state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic, whichever is later, the department, the health care authority, or any other state agency may not establish by rule or otherwise any new requirement for a hospital licensed under this chapter to report data or information except as specifically provided in this section. This limitation on establishing new data and information reporting requirements includes data or information related to the health care cost transparency board under chapter 70.390 RCW. The department may establish new data and information reporting requirements reasonably necessary to address the COVID-19 pandemic for patient care and vaccines. Nothing in this section changes the applicability of existing rules regarding hospitals licensed under this chapter reporting data and information to the department, the health care authority, and any other state agencies.</p>
