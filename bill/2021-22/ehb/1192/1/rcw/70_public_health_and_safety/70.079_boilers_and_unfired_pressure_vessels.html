At the expiration of their respective terms of office, they, or their successors identifiable with the same interests respectively as hereinafter provided, shall be appointed for terms of four years each. The governor may at any time remove any member of the board for inefficiency or neglect of duty in office. Upon the death or incapacity of any member the governor shall fill the vacancy for the remainder of the vacated term with a representative of the same interests with which his or her predecessor was identified. Of these five appointed members, one shall be representative of owners and users of boilers and unfired pressure vessels within the state, one shall be representative of the boiler or unfired pressure vessel manufacturers within the state, one shall be a representative of a boiler insurance company licensed to do business within the state, one shall be a mechanical engineer on the faculty of a recognized engineering college or a graduate mechanical engineer having equivalent experience, and one shall be representative of the boilermakers, stationary operating engineers, or pressure vessel operators. The board shall elect one of its members to serve as chair and, at the call of the chair, the board shall meet at least four times each year at the state capitol or other place designated by the board.</p>
