For taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2027, the primary residence property tax exemption is equal to the amount of state property taxes on up to $250,000 of the assessed valuation of the claimant's qualified residence used to calculate the property taxes due on the qualified residence for the calendar year for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed.

    b. For purposes of determining the primary residence property tax exemption for taxes levied for collection in each subsequent calendar year, the assessed value component of the exemption must be increased from the prior year. The amount of such increase for a year is equal to the percentage growth in the state property taxes levied for collection in the preceding year as compared to the state property taxes levied for collection two years ago. Beginning January 31, 2028, and by January 31st each year thereafter, the department is responsible for determining the increase in the assessed value component of the primary residence property tax exemption and may round the dollar amount of the assessed value increase to the nearest $1,000. The department must publish the adjusted assessed value component of this exemption on its website.

3. [Empty]

    a. When an exemption amount determined under subsection (2) of this section is less than the maximum possible exemption under that subsection, the department must adjust the exemption amount determined under subsection (2) of this section. An exemption amount under this subsection (3) is equal to the equalized assessed value of the claimant's qualified residence multiplied by the aggregate state property tax rates for the county in which the qualified residence is located for taxes levied for collection in the year in which the application for the primary residence property tax exemption is made.

    b. For purposes of this subsection (3), "equalized assessed value" means the lesser of:

        i. The assessed value of the claimant's qualified residence used to calculate the property taxes due for the year for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed, divided by the county's combined indicated ratio used by the department to determine the equalized state levy for collection in that same year for the county in which the claimant's qualified residence is located; or

        ii. $250,000 for an exemption for state property taxes levied for collection in 2027, or, for subsequent years, the applicable assessed value determined by the department as provided in subsection (2)(b) of this section for state property taxes levied for collection in the year for which the exemption under this section is claimed.

4. The primary residence property tax exemption is in addition to, and applied after, the exemption provided in RCW 84.36.379 through 84.36.389.

5. [Empty]

    a. [Empty]

        i. The primary residence property tax exemption must be annually claimed in a form and manner required by the department. Claims for the exemption must be received by the department by the last day of the calendar year for which the refund is claimed. The department may approve applications received after the deadline, as provided in section 4 of this act.

        ii. The department must provide a claimant a paper application upon request.

    b. The claimant or the claimant's designated legal representative must sign the application attesting that the property for which the primary residence property tax exemption sought is the claimant's principal place of residence and to the truth of the other information in the application. If the claimant holds a life estate in the qualified residence for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed and the claimant is not the taxpayer of record, the taxpayer of record must also sign the application. The signature requirements in this subsection (5)(b) may be met by an electronic signature. All signatures on an application must be made under penalty of perjury as provided in chapter 9A.72 RCW.

    c. Notice of the primary residence property tax exemption and where to obtain further information about the exemption must be included on or with property tax statements and revaluation notices for residential property. The department and each county assessor and county treasurer are required to publicize the qualifications and manner of making claims for the primary residence property tax exemption, including paid advertisements or notices as deemed appropriate in the sole discretion of the department and county assessors and county treasurers.

6. The following conditions apply to the primary residence property tax exemption:

    a. All property taxes due on the qualified residence must be paid in full for the year in which the application required under this section is submitted before the department makes a refund under this section to the claimant. If the claimant is delinquent on any property taxes, the department must send the claimant's primary residence property tax exemption to the treasurer of the county in which the claimant's qualified residence is located to be applied to the claimant's delinquent property taxes.

    b. The qualified residence must be occupied as the claimant's principal place of residence as of the date of the signed application required under subsection (5) of this section. No claimant may receive the primary residence property tax exemption on more than one qualified residence in any calendar year. However, the confinement of the claimant to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, or adult family home will not disqualify the claim of exemption if:

        i. The qualified residence is temporarily unoccupied;

        ii. The qualified residence is occupied by the claimant's spouse or state registered domestic partner or a person financially dependent on the claimant for support; or

        iii. The qualified residence is rented for the purpose of paying the claimant's costs of a nursing home, hospital, assisted living facility, or adult family home.

    c. At the time of signing the application for exemption under this section:

        i. The claimant must have owned, in fee or by contract purchase, or have held a life estate in, the qualified residence for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed; or

        ii. If the claimant resides in a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership, including a mobile home park cooperative or manufactured housing cooperative, the claimant must own a share in the cooperative representing the unit or dwelling in which the claimant resides or the lot on which the claimant's manufactured/mobile home or park model is situated.

    d. For purposes of this section, a qualified residence owned by a marital community, state registered domestic partners, or cotenants is owned by each spouse, domestic partner, or cotenant, and any lease for life or 99 years of a single-family dwelling unit or the land upon which it stands is a life estate in the residence.

    e. Where a claimant has a life estate in, and is not the taxpayer of record for, their qualified residence, the claimant is not entitled to the exemption under this section unless the taxpayer of record confirms, in a form and manner required by the department, that the claimant is required to reimburse the taxpayer of record for the property taxes due on the claimant's qualified residence.

    f. The claimant must not have received a renter's credit for the same year for which a primary residence property tax exemption is claimed, except:

        i. For a qualified residence that includes a single-family dwelling unit owned by the claimant and located on leased land; and

        ii. The refund under this section combined with the refund under section 3 of this act may not exceed the allowable amount under subsection (2) of this section.

    g. A person may not claim a primary residence property tax exemption on behalf of a deceased individual.

    h. The amount of the primary residence property tax exemption for a qualified residence may not result in a refund that exceeds the amount of state property taxes otherwise due on that residence.

7. For any fiscal period, the primary residence property tax exemption under this section must be approved by the legislature in the omnibus appropriations act before persons may claim the exemption during the fiscal period.

8. The legislature may limit eligibility for the primary residence property tax exemption to low-income households if the proposed amendment to Article VII of the state Constitution repealing the uniformity clause (Senate Joint Resolution No. . . . (S-0739/23)) is validly submitted to and is approved and ratified by the voters.

9. For purposes of this section, "taxpayer of record" means the person shown on the county's tax rolls as the taxpayer for a qualified residence.

## Section 3
