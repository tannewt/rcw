# HB 1056 - Postretirement employment

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1056-S.pdf)

## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to remove some of the restrictions on the types and amount of postretirement employment that members that chose the enhanced early retirement formula created in 2008 for the public employees', school employees', and teachers' retirement systems plans 2 and 3 can perform while in receipt of a retirement allowance. This change simplifies administration of the retirement system and could assist employers currently experiencing difficulties recruiting and retaining employees. In addition, some employees were offered and accepted a choice of lower early retirement benefits without the work-related benefit restrictions that are now being removed from those that chose higher benefits. The legislature intends those employees not be penalized for that choice after the employment-related benefit restrictions are removed. Therefore, pursuant to this act, the legislature intends that the employees that chose the three percent per year early retirement reduction and fewer benefit restrictions, rather than the 2008 early retirement formula with restrictions now being removed, shall have their benefit reduction recalculated to the level of the 2008 reduction for benefits made on or after the effective date of this section.

## Section 2

Any member who has completed at least twenty service credit years of service who has attained at least age fifty-five shall be eligible to retire and to receive a retirement allowance computed according to the provisions of RCW 41.32.760, except that a member retiring pursuant to this subsection shall have the retirement allowance actuarially reduced to reflect the difference in the number of years between age at retirement and the attainment of age sixty-five.

3. ALTERNATE EARLY RETIREMENT.

    a. Any member who has completed at least thirty service credit years and has attained age fifty-five shall be eligible to retire and to receive a retirement allowance computed according to the provisions of RCW 41.32.760, except that a member retiring pursuant to this subsection shall have the retirement allowance reduced by three percent per year to reflect the difference in the number of years between age at retirement and the attainment of age sixty-five.
