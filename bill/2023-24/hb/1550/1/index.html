<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that high quality early learning is the best way to ensure children have the social-emotional skills and other skills they need to enter kindergarten ready to learn. Unfortunately, too many children across the state do not have access to high quality early learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the early childhood education and assistance program, the state's preschool program, is expanding and will become an entitlement for eligible children in the year 2026. The fair start for kids act, enacted in 2021 by Washington state, is helping to expand access to more affordable, high quality child care and early learning and federal early learning programs serve thousands of families across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the legislature finds that these early learning programs do not yet reach all families in need. As a result, there are children about to enter kindergarten who need an opportunity for high quality preschool in order to be successful kindergarten students in the following school year. Some school districts have attempted to address this gap by creating transitional kindergarten programs funded with state basic education allocations. However, not all transitional kindergarten programs meet the high quality age-appropriate early learning standards that other state-funded early learning programs are required to meet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a transition to kindergarten program that meets early learning standards in lieu of transitional kindergarten programs and to help fill in gaps in access to high quality early learning for eligible children. The legislature intends to provide state funding, which is separate from the state basic education allocation, for the transition to kindergarten program so that it can be offered at no charge to eligible students, and to prohibit the use of state basic education allocations for this program. The legislature also intends to: Require that the early learning ecosystem work together; promote coordinated systems of comprehensive early learning services; maximize efficient use of state, federal, and local resources; and ensure that children and families get the early learning services they need in the most appropriate setting.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section and otherwise provided by law, it is the general policy of the state that the common schools shall be open to the admission of all persons who are five years of age and less than 21 years residing in that school district. Except as otherwise provided by law or rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction, districts may establish uniform entry qualifications, including but not limited to birthdate requirements, for admission to kindergarten and first grade programs of the common schools. Such rules may provide for exceptions based upon the ability, or the need, or both, of an individual student. For the purpose of complying with any rule adopted by the superintendent of public instruction that authorizes a preadmission screening process as a prerequisite to granting exceptions to the uniform entry qualifications, a school district may collect fees to cover expenses incurred in the administration of any preadmission screening process: PROVIDED, That in so establishing such fee or fees, the district shall adopt rules for waiving and reducing such fees in the cases of those persons whose families, by reason of their low income, would have difficulty in paying the entire amount of such fees. Beginning with the 2024-25 school year, rules providing for exceptions to the uniform entry qualifications for kindergarten must limit early kindergarten admission to children who are likely to be successful in kindergarten as demonstrated through the whole-child assessment of the Washington kindergarten inventory of developing skills.</p>

<p>A student who meets the definition of a child of a military family in transition under Article II of RCW 28A.705.010 shall be permitted to continue enrollment at the grade level in the common schools commensurate with the grade level of the student when attending school in the sending state as defined in Article II of RCW 28A.705.010, regardless of age or birthdate requirements.</p>
