<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is in the best interest of the state, its people, and its natural resources to protect and restore riparian areas, prioritizing those that provide shade and other cobenefits to support salmon recovery, by enhancing salmon habitat and watershed health.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this act to restore and protect riparian areas, enlisting the stewards of those watersheds through a voluntary riparian grant program for landowners while developing options for compensatory, mitigation, and regulatory measures to achieve progress on riparian protection in support of salmon recovery.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The commission shall establish and administer a riparian grant program. Within funds provided for this purpose, the commission shall develop and implement the riparian grant program to fund protection and restoration of critical riparian management zones. By December 31, 2023 the commission shall adopt standards to achieve, wherever possible, fully functioning riparian ecosystems in priority critical riparian management zones. The standards must be adopted by the commission after coordination with the department of ecology and the department of fish and wildlife, conservation districts, Indian tribes, and other interested stakeholders, and shall consider information from the department of ecology and the department of fish and wildlife's publications, including Riparian Ecosystems, Volume 1: Science Synthesis and Management Implications (2020) and Riparian Ecosystems, Volume 2: Management Recommendations (2020) as the best available science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall, by June 30, 2024, and in coordination with conservation districts, the department of fish and wildlife, the department of ecology, the recreation and conservation office, the Puget Sound partnership, counties, water resource inventory areas organized pursuant to chapter 90.82 RCW, the Brian Abbott fish passage barrier removal board, federally recognized Indian tribes, and the interagency riparian committee created in section 4 of this act, prioritize critical riparian management zones at the watershed or subbasin scale where grant funding under this program would be primarily targeted. The prioritization must be informed by, and consistent with, to the extent practicable, watershed plans developed pursuant to chapter 90.82 RCW, the habitat project list developed pursuant to RCW 77.85.050, and priority projects identified for salmon recovery through agency grant programs.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Allowable expenses to a grantee including, but not limited to, labor, equipment, fencing, mulch, seed, seedling trees, manual weed control, and yearly maintenance costs for up to 10 years;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<li>Other requirements as determined by the commission.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>Preference and compensation will be given for permanent protection of riparian areas and removal of riparian land from agricultural production or other development by purchase at fair market value.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall determine appropriate recordkeeping and data collections procedures required for program implementation and shall establish a data management system that allows for coordination between the commission and other agencies on data sharing under the interagency riparian committee created in section 4 of this act. Funded project data may only be released at a subbasin scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall develop and adopt, after coordination with the interagency riparian committee created in section 4 of this act, a program monitoring and adaptive management framework to ensure consistency and compliance with the requirements of the riparian grant program. The program monitoring and adaptive management framework may include, but is not limited to, consideration of: Acres identified as eligible for restoration within a watershed; acres planned to be restored; acres actually planted and maintained; success in targeting and achieving aggregated project implementation resulting in increase in linear miles restored; plan review criteria; and other factors as identified by the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No more than two percent of any funds appropriated for this purpose may be used for targeted outreach activities that focus on critically identified geographic locations for listed salmon species, water quality, or water temperature to produce identified project lists.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;critical riparian management zone&quot; means the area adjacent to freshwaters, wetlands, and marine waters that provide functions such as water quality, water storage, shade, leaf litter, bank stability, large woody material, and that is in critical need of protection or restoration for salmon recovery.</p>
