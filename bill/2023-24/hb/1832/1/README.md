# HB 1832 - Vehicle per mile charge

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1832.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that increasing the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid motor vehicles is helping to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, in the state. At the same time, the legislature also finds that a fair and equitable means of funding the statewide transportation system in the long term is needed as vehicles become more fuel efficient and this impacts state fuel tax revenue, which has historically funded the construction, preservation, maintenance, and operations of the state highway system and the state ferry system. The legislature also finds that a road usage charge or per mile fee is a viable funding method that more fairly and accurately corresponds to road users use of public roads by amount of usage as compared to registration fees or motor vehicle fuel taxes. It is, therefore, the legislature's intent to establish a voluntary road usage charge program that imposes a per mile fee for the use of public roads as a first step in establishing a more comprehensive, mandatory road usage charge.

The legislature further finds and declares that the road usage charge system must protect individuals' privacy and civil liberties. Experience in states that collect road usage charges, in addition to the research and year-long test of road usage charging in Washington, demonstrates that mileage-based charges can be implemented in a manner that ensures data security and protects the privacy of motor vehicle owners. The legislature intends that the road usage charge system authorized in this act be designed and implemented in a manner that places privacy of the motor vehicle owner as a first principle, especially with regard to location data.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. [Empty]

        i. A voluntary road usage charge program is established that places a per mile fee on motor vehicle usage of public roadways in the state. The department shall implement and administer the voluntary road usage charge program. The vehicles specified in this section are subject to the requirements of the voluntary road usage charge program. The target date for implementation of a comprehensive, mandatory road usage charge program is January 1, 2030.

        ii. The road usage charge rate for the voluntary road usage charge program is 2.5 cents per mile.

        iii. The electric and hybrid-electric vehicle registration renewal fees specified in RCW 46.17.323 and the transportation electrification fees specified in RCW 46.17.324 are waived for vehicles participating in the voluntary road usage charge program.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Beginning July 1, 2025, for reasons of administrative efficiency of fee collection, before accepting an application for an annual vehicle renewal for a motor vehicle registering for on-road use, the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director must require the applicant to pay a road usage charge as specified in this section if the applicant enrolled the vehicle in the voluntary road usage charge program established in this section for the prior 12-month period of vehicle registration. This charge is separate and distinct from vehicle licensing fees and taxes required by law.

        ii. The road usage charge due at the end of each 12-month period following vehicle registration under the voluntary road usage charge program established in this subsection may not exceed the combined amount in fees required under RCW 46.17.323 and 46.17.324 that would be due if they were not waived for the vehicle as a result of its enrollment in the voluntary road usage charge program.

        iii. The annual per mile fee due for a vehicle participating in the voluntary road usage charge program at the end of each 12-month period of voluntary road usage charge program enrollment under this subsection (1)(b) is reduced by a fee credit in the amount of the motor vehicle fuel tax imposed under chapter 82.38 RCW that is determined by the department to correspond, either constructively or in actuality, to the vehicle's annual motor vehicle fuel usage. The fee credit is available solely to offset the road usage charge fee due based on applicable vehicle miles driven during the year the fee credit is earned and is nonrefundable and nontransferable to future years of program participation. The department shall adopt methodologies used to determine constructive annual motor vehicle fuel usage by vehicles, as well as requirements for the determination of actual fuel usage by vehicles, by rule.

    c. The department must adopt rules to implement the portions of the voluntary road usage charge program specified in (b) of this subsection (1).

2. [Empty]

    a. The department shall offer vehicle owners the option to report miles driven through the submittal of periodic odometer mileage. The department may also offer vehicle owners the option of one or more automated methods of reporting miles driven.

    b. With participation from the department, the Washington state transportation commission shall engage vehicle manufacturers to explore the possibility of the vehicle manufacturer providing vehicle miles traveled information to the department that could meet road usage charge program reporting requirements, if authorized by a voluntary road usage charge program participant, and report back to the transportation committees of the legislature by December 1, 2024, on the capability and willingness of vehicle manufacturers to partner with the department to provide a manufacturer-based method for reporting vehicle miles traveled.

3. The department shall establish a process for submission of documentation by voluntary road usage charge program participants claiming a road usage charge fee exemption for vehicle miles driven on roadways that are not public roadways in the state. Application for a road usage charge fee exemption must be made to the department in a form and manner determined by the department. The application must include any information and documentation required by the department.

4. The department may temporarily pause enrollment in the voluntary road usage charge program should the department's capacity to effectively administer the program be reached, as determined by the department, until the department is able to expand the department's capacity to accommodate a greater program enrollment level.
