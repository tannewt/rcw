<ol>
<li>
<p>A capital budget is hereby adopted and, subject to the provisions set forth in this act, the several dollar amounts hereinafter specified, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to accomplish the purposes designated, are hereby appropriated and authorized to be incurred for capital projects during the period beginning with the effective date of this act and ending June 30, 2025, out of the several funds specified in this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Fiscal year 2024&quot; or &quot;FY 2024&quot; means the period beginning July 1, 2023, and ending June 30, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Fiscal year 2025&quot; or &quot;FY 2025&quot; means the period beginning July 1, 2024, and ending June 30, 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Lapse&quot; or &quot;revert&quot; means the amount shall return to an unappropriated status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Provided solely&quot; means the specified amount may be spent only for the specified purpose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise specifically authorized in this act, any portion of an amount provided solely for a specified purpose that is not expended subject to the specified conditions and limitations to fulfill the specified purpose shall lapse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amounts shown under the headings &quot;Prior Biennia,&quot; &quot;Future Biennia,&quot; and &quot;Total&quot; in this act are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legislative approval of these amounts. &quot;Prior biennia&quot; typically refers to the immediate prior biennium for reappropriations, but may refer to multiple biennia in the case of specific projects. A &quot;future biennia&quot; amount is an estimate of what may be appropriated for the project or program in the 2025-2027 biennium and the following three biennia; an amount of zero does not necessarily constitute legislative intent to not provide funding for the project or program in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Reappropriations&quot; in this act are appropriations and, unless the context clearly provides otherwise, are subject to the relevant conditions and limitations applicable to appropriations. Reappropriations shall be limited to the unexpended balances remaining on June 30, 2023, from the 2021-2023 biennial appropriations for each project.</p>

<p>The following agencies may enter into financial contracts, paid from any funds of an agency, appropriated or nonappropriated, for the purposes indicated and in not more than the principal amounts indicated, plus financing expenses and required reserves pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW. When securing properties under this section, agencies shall use the most economical financial contract option available, including long-term leases, lease-purchase agreements, lease-development with option to purchase agreements or financial contracts using certificates of participation. Expenditures made by an agency for one of the indicated purposes before the issue date of the authorized financial contract and any certificates of participation therein are intended to be reimbursed from proceeds of the financial contract and any certificates of participation therein to the extent provided in the agency's financing plan approved by the state finance committee.</p>

<li>
<p>Department of social and health services: Enter into a financing contract for up to $175,888,000 plus costs and financing expenses and required reserves pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW to construct a nursing facility on the fircrest residential habilitation center campus. The department may contract to lease develop or lease purchase the facility. Before entering into a contract, the department must consult with the office of financial management and the office of the state treasurer. Should the department of social and health services choose to use a financing contract that does not provide for the issuance of certificates of participation, the financing contract shall be subject to approval by the state finance committee as required by RCW 39.94.010. In approving a financing contract not providing for the use of certificates of participation, the state finance committee should be reasonably certain that the contract is excluded from the computation of indebtedness, particularly that the contract is not backed by the full faith and credit of the state and the legislature is expressly not obligated to appropriate funds to make payments. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;financing contract&quot; includes but is not limited to a certificate of participation and tax exempt financing similar to that authorized in RCW 47.79.140.</p>

<p>To ensure that major construction projects are carried out in accordance with legislative and executive intent, agencies must complete a predesign for state construction projects with a total anticipated cost in excess of $10,000,000. For purposes of this section, &quot;total anticipated cost&quot; means the sum of the anticipated cost of the predesign, design, and construction phases of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appropriations for design may not be expended or encumbered until the office of financial management has reviewed and approved the agency's predesign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The predesign must explore at least three project alternatives. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. The chosen alternative should be the most reasonable and cost-effective solution. The predesign document must include, but not be limited to, program, site, and cost analysis, and an analysis of the life-cycle costs of the alternatives explored, in accordance with the predesign manual adopted by the office of financial management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For projects exceeding the $10,000,000 predesign threshold established in this section, the office of financial management may make an exception to some or all of the predesign requirements in this section. The office of financial management shall report any exception to the fiscal committees of the legislature:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of the major capital project for which the predesign waiver is made;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An explanation of the reason for the waiver; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rough order of magnitude cost estimate for the project's design and construction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In deliberations related to submitting an exception under this section, the office of financial management shall consider the following factors:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether there is any determination to be made regarding the site of the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether there is any determination to be made regarding whether the project will involve renovation, new construction, or both;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether, within six years of submitting the request for funding, the agency has completed, or initiated the construction of, a substantially similar project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether there is any anticipated change to the project's program or the services to be delivered at the facility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the requesting agency indicates that the project may not require some or all of the predesign requirements in this section due to a lack of complexity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether any other factors related to project complexity or risk, as determined by the office of financial management, could reduce the need for, or scope of, a predesign.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature finds that use of life-cycle cost analysis will aid public entities, architects, engineers, and contractors in making design and construction decisions that positively impact both the initial construction cost and the ongoing operating and maintenance cost of a project. To ensure that the total cost of a project is accounted for and the most reasonable and cost efficient design is used, agencies shall develop life-cycle costs for any construction project over $10,000,000. The life-cycle costs must represent the present value sum of capital costs, installation costs, operating costs, and maintenance costs over the life expectancy of the project. The legislature further finds the most effective approach to the life-cycle cost analysis is to integrate it into the early part of the design process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies must develop a minimum of three project alternatives for use in the life-cycle cost analysis. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. Agencies must choose the most reasonable and cost-effective solution, as supported by the life-cycle cost analysis. A brief description of each project alternative and why it was chosen must be included in the life-cycle cost analysis section of the predesign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management shall: (a) Make available a life-cycle cost model to be used for analysis; (b) in consultation with the department of enterprise services, provide assistance in using the life-cycle cost model; and (c) update the life-cycle cost model annually including assumptions for inflation rates, discount rates, and energy rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies shall consider architectural and engineering firms' and general contractors' experience using life-cycle costs, operating costs, and energy efficiency measures when selecting an architectural and engineering firm, or when selecting contractors using alternative contracting methods.</p>

<p>The office of financial management may authorize a transfer of appropriation authority provided for a capital project that is in excess of the amount required for the completion of such project to another capital project for which the appropriation is insufficient. No such transfer may be used to expand the capacity of any facility beyond that intended in making the appropriation. Such transfers may be effected only between capital appropriations to a specific department, commission, agency, or institution of higher education and only between capital projects that are funded from the same fund or account. No transfers may occur between projects to local government agencies except where the grants are provided within a single omnibus appropriation and where such transfers are specifically authorized by the implementing statutes that govern the grants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of financial management may find that an amount is in excess of the amount required for the completion of a project only if: (a) The project as defined in the notes to the budget document is substantially complete and there are funds remaining; or (b) bids have been let on a project and it appears to a substantial certainty that the project as defined in the notes to the budget document can be completed within the biennium for less than the amount appropriated in this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the intent is that each project be defined as proposed to the legislature in the governor's budget document, unless it clearly appears from the legislative history that the legislature intended to define the scope of a project in a different way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A report of any transfer effected under this section, except emergency projects or any transfer under $250,000, shall be filed with the fiscal committees of the legislature by the office of financial management at least 30 days before the date the transfer is effected.

<p>Agencies shall expedite the expenditure of reappropriations and appropriations in this act in order to: (a) Rehabilitate infrastructure resources; (b) accelerate environmental rehabilitation and restoration projects for the improvement of the state's natural environment; (c) reduce additional costs associated with acquisition and construction inflationary pressures; and (d) provide additional employment opportunities associated with capital expenditures.</p>

The following design and construction attributes must be integrated into the building project:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Employ integrated design principles: Use a collaborative, integrated planning and design process that initiates and maintains an integrated project team in all stages of a project's planning and delivery. Establish performance goals for siting, energy, water, materials, and indoor environmental quality along with other comprehensive design goals and ensures incorporation of these goals throughout the design and life-cycle of the building.

<p>Commissioning: Employ commissioning practices tailored to the size and complexity of the building and its system components in order to verify performance of building components and systems and help ensure that design requirements are met. This should include an experienced commissioning provider, inclusion of commissioning requirements in construction documents, a commissioning plan, verification of the installation and performance of systems to be commissioned, and a commissioning report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize energy performance: Establish a whole building performance target that takes into account the intended use, occupancy, operations, plug loads, other energy demands, and design to earn the ENERGY STAR targets for new construction and major renovation where applicable. For new construction target low energy use index. For major renovations, target reducing energy use by 50 percent below prerenovations baseline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-site renewable energy: Implement renewable energy generation projects on agency property for agency use, when life-cycle cost effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-efficiency electric equipment: Use only high-efficiency electric equipment for water and space heating needs not met through on-site renewable energy, when life-cycle cost effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measurement and verification: For buildings over 50,000 square feet, install building level electricity meters in new major construction and renovation projects to track and continuously optimize performance. Include equivalent meters for natural gas and steam, where natural gas and steam are used. Where appropriate, install dashboards inside buildings to display and incentivize occupants on energy use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benchmarking: Compare performance data from the first year of operation with the energy design target. Verify that the building performance meets or exceeds the design target. For other building and space types, use an equivalent benchmarking tool.</p>
