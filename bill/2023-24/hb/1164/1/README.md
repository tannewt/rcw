# HB 1164 - Appliance management

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1164.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that Washington has taken numerous steps to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting refrigerants and greenhouse gas refrigerants, including by establishing maximum global warming potentials of new appliances introduced into commerce, and initiating a refrigerant management program to address leaks from equipment in operation. State law also prohibits the intentional venting of refrigerants, including refrigerants contained in appliances that reach the end of their useful life. However, the current regulatory environment notably lacks a mechanism to ensure that refrigerants and greenhouse gases contained in foams in appliances that reach the end of their life are managed appropriately. Unfortunately, a misplaced incentive often currently exists for persons disposing of an unwanted appliance that makes it less costly and easier to dispose of refrigerants contained in an appliance through illegal venting, which is functionally challenging to prevent or to take enforcement actions against, rather than through environmentally responsible practices. In addition, the current regulatory environment does not establish incentives or otherwise ensure that greenhouse gas-containing foam in appliances will be managed in an environmentally responsible way.

2. Federal law, through its responsible appliance disposal program, establishes voluntary achievable and environmentally friendly appliance management standards that many people disposing of unwanted appliances already abide by. In conjunction with utility incentive programs that spur the replacement of energy-inefficient old appliances, there already exists the beginnings of the infrastructure needed to more comprehensively manage greenhouse gas-containing appliances at the end of their useful life. One gap to ensuring this environmentally preferable outcome is a consistent funding mechanism to use and expand this appliance collection recycling infrastructure. Other jurisdictions in North America and around the world have addressed this funding gap by establishing stewardship programs for the funding and management of unwanted appliances. Appliance producer responsibility programs offer a significant opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are not currently addressed by the state's other greenhouse gas emissions programs, and do so at a relatively low cost per ton of emissions reductions, and with other environmental benefits from the salvage and recycling of other appliance components.

3. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish a responsible appliance disposal extended producer responsibility program.
