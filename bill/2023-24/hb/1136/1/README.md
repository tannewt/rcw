[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1136.pdf)

## Section 1
1. An employer shall reimburse an employee for all necessary expenditures and losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of the employee's duties. Reimbursement must be paid within 30 days of the employer's actual or constructive notice of the expenditure or loss.

2. If an employer does not reimburse the employee as required under this section, the employee may bring a civil cause of action. If the employee prevails, the court shall award the employee reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred to enforce this section. Awards carry interest at the same rate as civil judgments under RCW 4.56.110. Interest accrues from the date on which the employee incurred the necessary expenditure or loss.
