<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that beneficiaries receiving a monthly benefit from the public employees' retirement system plan 1 and the teachers' retirement system plan 1 have experienced a loss of purchasing power due to rising inflation. Certain beneficiaries do not receive annual increases; providing an ongoing limited cost-of-living adjustment helps address beneficiaries' loss of purchasing power. In recent years these plans have benefited from extraordinary investment return, and are projected to be more than fully funded in the years ahead. In 2021, the pension funding council recommended lowering the long-term rate of investment return from 7.5 to 7.0 percent, consistent with the state investment's board's recommendations about future returns, but in contrast with the state investment board's historical performance which has continued to climb to above nine percent since the management of the pension funds began. The legislature determines that lowering the investment rate of return was prudent, but the pension funding council's recommendation does not need to be fully implemented at this time. As the council will continue to review the rates of return every two years, as required by current law, additional adjustments may be needed in future years. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to align both monthly benefit adjustments and the long-term investment rate of return assumptions more closely in line with actual economic and financial experience. The changes to expectations about investment return and future benefit increases in this act are part of an integrated decision by the legislature in balancing the future funding of the public employees' and teachers' retirement system plans 1, and should, consistent with the plain language of this act, be considered nonseverable.</p>
