</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure the privacy and security of all ballots returned to the county auditor through the portal to confirm that ballots have not been viewed or altered during the transmission of the ballot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the county canvassing board, or its designated representatives, to verify that each ballot returned through the portal was returned by a registered voter who is eligible to vote in the election or primary and has not returned another ballot in the same election or primary, while maintaining the secrecy of the selections made on the ballot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not be connected to any part of a voting system as defined in RCW 29A.12.005 and produce a paper copy of each ballot returned through the portal to be used for tabulation on a voting system which is separate from the online ballot portal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instruct the voter on how to return the voter's ballot; and</p>
</li>

<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The county auditor shall send each voter a ballot, a security envelope in which to conceal the ballot after voting, a larger envelope in which to return the security envelope, a declaration that the voter must sign, and instructions on how to obtain information about the election, how to mark the ballot, and how to return the ballot to the county auditor.
