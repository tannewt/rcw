2. Any online ballot portal used in the state must, at a minimum:

    a. Comply with all state and federal requirements and current best practices for accessibility for individuals with disabilities;

    c. Allow the county auditor to verify whether any ballot returned through the portal was returned on time under subsection (5) of this section;

    d. Ensure the privacy and security of all ballots returned to the county auditor through the portal to confirm that ballots have not been viewed or altered during the transmission of the ballot;

    e. Allow the county canvassing board, or its designated representatives, to verify that each ballot returned through the portal was returned by a registered voter who is eligible to vote in the election or primary and has not returned another ballot in the same election or primary, while maintaining the secrecy of the selections made on the ballot;

    f. Not be connected to any part of a voting system as defined in RCW 29A.12.005 and produce a paper copy of each ballot returned through the portal to be used for tabulation on a voting system which is separate from the online ballot portal;

    g. Instruct the voter on how to return the voter's ballot; and

    h. Include on the screen where a voter described in subsection (4) of this section may submit a voted ballot the following: "I attest under penalty of perjury that I meet the qualifications to return my ballot using this online ballot portal."

The calendar date of the election must be prominently displayed in bold type, twenty-point font or larger, on the envelope sent to the voter containing the ballot and other materials listed in this subsection

The ballot materials must provide space for the voter to sign the declaration, indicate the date on which the ballot was voted, and include a telephone number.
