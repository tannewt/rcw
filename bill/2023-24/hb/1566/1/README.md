## Section 1
Each subordinate officer and employee of the several offices, departments, and institutions of the state government shall be entitled under their contract of employment with the state government to not less than eight hours of vacation leave with full pay for each month of employment.

## Section 2
As an alternative, in addition to the provisions of RCW 43.01.040 authorizing the accumulation of vacation leave in excess of 280 hours with the filing of a statement of necessity, vacation leave in excess of 280 hours may also be accumulated as provided in this section but without the filing of a statement of necessity. The accumulation of leave under this alternative method shall be governed by the following provisions:

3. This section shall not result in any increase in a retirement allowance under any public retirement system in this state.

4. Should the legislature revoke any benefits or rights provided under this section, no affected officer or employee shall be entitled thereafter to receive such benefits or exercise such rights as a matter of contractual right.
