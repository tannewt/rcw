<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When unemployment insurance was established by the United States congress and the state legislature, the legislature explicitly recognized that economic insecurity caused by unemployment is the greatest hazard of our economic life that falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker, which therefore requires the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to reduce the suffering caused by unemployment to a minimum. Unemployment insurance is essential to ensure that individuals who lose income can survive and meet their basic needs during periods they are unable to find stable work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many immigrant workers, however, are not eligible for unemployment insurance and have not received any assistance from this jointly administered state and federal insurance program. RCW 50.20.098 provides that unemployment insurance benefits shall not be payable unless the individual was lawfully admitted for permanent residence, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or otherwise was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed. Title 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1621(d) requires that states wishing to extend benefits beyond a short list of qualified immigrants must affirmatively do so. Those ineligible to receive unemployment benefits include workers without work authorization, workers whose work authorization has expired or is awaiting renewal, and workers who recently regularized their immigration status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ineligibility for unemployment benefits has devastated immigrant communities during the pandemic economic crisis, particularly immigrants working in low-wage industries. Several of the industries that have experienced the highest rates of job loss in Washington due to the pandemic are low-wage sectors with the highest numbers of immigrant workers including the restaurant, hotel, retail, and construction industries. Economists predict large-scale permanent job loss and long-term unemployment as the effects of the pandemic are similar to the great recession of 2008. Without access to unemployment benefits among other critical safety net programs, Washington's immigrant communities face deep economic devastation for years to come. Prior to the pandemic, the poverty rate of immigrants in Washington was already high, with 18 percent of the state's immigrant residents living in poverty compared to 12 percent of United States born residents. The crisis is expected to significantly expand this disparity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support the survival of Washington's immigrant workers and families during periods of crisis, particularly low-income households, and to provide the safety net that United States born Washington residents can access, the legislature intends to establish a weekly wage replacement state program similar to the state and federal unemployment insurance program for workers who are unemployed and not eligible for the state and federal unemployment insurance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The claimant files an application for initial determination of benefits under Title 50 RCW;</p>

<p>After a denial under subsection (2) of this section, the department invites the claimant to apply for benefits under this title; and</p>

If, after the department's request, the claimant fails to provide sufficient information or documentation, the claimant may be denied benefits under this title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may request information or documentation from the claimant's former employers to verify the circumstances under which the claimant separated from employment when determining the eligibility standard under subsection (1)(c) of this section. If an employer fails to respond to a request under this subsection (3), the department must consider the eligibility standard under subsection (1)(c) of this section satisfied.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the department determines the claimant is eligible for benefits under this title, the claimant may qualify for weekly benefits by self-attesting, in a form and manner adopted in rule by the department, that the claimant meets the following requirements for each week of unemployment in which the claimant is applying for benefits under this title:</p>

<p>If waiting period credit or the payment of benefits under this title are denied to any claimant for any week or weeks, the claimant must be promptly issued written notice of the denial and reasons for such denial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department believes the claimant's right to waiting period credit or benefits under this title is at issue because of the claimant's separation from work for any reason other than lack of work, the department must promptly issue a determination of allowance or denial of waiting period credit or benefits under this title and the reasons for such allowance or denial to the claimant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice that the waiting period credit or benefits under this title allowed or denied must suffice for the particular weeks stated in the notice or until the condition upon which the allowance or denial was based has been changed.</p>
