# HB 1791 - Commercial aviation services

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/1791-S.PL.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds:

    a. The state's transportation needs are growing and it is imperative that the state plan comprehensively to meet the needs of its citizens, particularly in the fastest growing regions of the state;

    b. That planning for the future of aviation must take a comprehensive coordinated look at the transportation system as a whole;

    c. The pandemic interfered with the ability of the commercial aviation coordinating commission to perform a thorough and complete study of the possibility of a new commercial airport;

    d. The creation of a new primary commercial aviation facility has the potential for environmental, health, social, and economic impacts on the surrounding communities, and the legislature recognizes any preferred location will require substantial environmental, land use, governance, and funding decisions from federal, state, and local governments;

    e. There is expected growth in commercial aviation, general aviation, and air cargo operations; the Puget Sound regional council May 2021 regional aviation baseline study final report estimates that by 2050 capacity restrictions in the central Puget Sound will create a gap between the demand for aviation activities and the capacity for those activities; and

    f. The exploration of alternatives to Seattle-Tacoma international airport is critical to address this anticipated demand through a variety of transportation strategies that may include the creation or expansion of other airports.

2. The legislature, therefore, intends to replace the commercial aviation coordinating commission with the commercial aviation work group and direct the work group to provide a comprehensive investigation of airport capacity in the state and the best way to address aviation needs in the context of overall state transportation needs in the next 20 years using independent verifiable data.

## Section 2
1. The state commercial aviation work group is created to carry out the functions of section 3 of this act. The work group shall consist of 19 voting members.

2. The governor shall appoint 19 voting members to represent the following interests:

    a. Four as representatives of commercial service airports and ports, one of whom shall represent a port located in a county with a population of 2,000,000 or more, one of whom shall represent a port in eastern Washington with an airport runway of at least 13,500 feet in length, one of whom shall represent a commercial service airport in eastern Washington located in a county with a population of 400,000 or more, and one representing an association of ports;

    b. Two as representatives from the airline industry or businesses dependent upon air service;

    c. One representative from a statewide business association;

    d. Seven citizen representatives with at least two appointed from eastern Washington and at least two appointed from western Washington. The citizen appointees must:

6. The department of transportation shall provide staff support for coordinating and administering the work group and technical assistance as requested by work group members.

7. At the direction of the work group, and as resources allow, the department of transportation is authorized to hire consultants to assist with the review and research efforts of the work group.

## Section 3
1. The state commercial aviation work group shall comprehensively evaluate the long-range commercial aviation needs of Washington within the broader context of state transportation needs and the specific needs of western Washington. The work group shall review existing data and conduct research to determine Washington's long-range commercial aviation facility needs while considering alternatives to additional airport capacity.

2. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the work group shall investigate the expansion of existing aviation facilities and possible siting locations for a new greenfield aviation facilities, with the expected outcome to be a report that compares the strengths and weaknesses of each site considered. In this investigation, the work group shall consider both new sites and those previously identified in previous aviation planning documents. The work group must consider all impacts that, whether by the expansion of a current facility or the location of a new greenfield site, the creation of a new primary commercial aviation facility may have, including impacts on:

        i. Community members and quality of life;

        ii. The environment, including the impacts of a facility on water quality and the ability of the state to meet the greenhouse gas emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020;

        iii. County master plans and other local planning and zoning, including development regulations and comprehensive plans adopted under chapter 36.70A RCW; and

        iv. Current airspace operations.

    b. The work group shall:

        i. Perform outreach to and make efforts to collaborate with:

(A) Applicable federal agencies including the federal aviation administration, the United States environmental protection agency, the United States department of defense, and the United States department of energy;

(B) Indian tribes, as defined in RCW 43.376.010, though outreach and collaboration by the work group under this subsection does not constitute or substitute for formal government-to-government consultation under the 1989 State-Tribal Relations/Centennial Accord and chapter 43.376 RCW;

(C) The environmental community;

(D) Local communities;

(E) Economic development agencies;

        ii.

        iii. Consider the cost of construction of a facility and supporting infrastructure;

        iv. In cooperation with the federal aviation administration, analyze:

(A) Airspace requirements and airspace restrictions of potential sites;

(B) Any possible terrain and man-made obstacles that could possibly create a hazard to aircraft;

(C) Local weather patterns and microclimates to determine if they will create issues for the operation of large aircraft; and

    v. Carry out other duties as assigned by the legislature.

3. The work group shall not consider:

    a. Expansion opportunities for a port or county run airport located in a county with a population of 2,000,000 or more; or
