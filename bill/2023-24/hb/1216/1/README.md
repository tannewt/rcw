# HB 1216 - Clean energy siting

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1216.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that efficient and effective siting and permitting of new clean energy projects throughout Washington is necessary to: Fight climate change and achieve the state's greenhouse gas emission limits; improve air quality; grow family-wage clean energy jobs and innovative clean energy businesses that provide economic benefits across the state; and make available secure domestic sources of the clean energy products needed to transition off fossil fuels. These projects include renewable energy such as wind and solar, transmission, green electrolytic and renewable hydrogen, alternative jet fuels, battery and pumped storage of clean energy, and manufacturing of clean energy products.

2. The legislature intends to: Enable more efficient and effective siting and permitting of clean energy projects with policies and investments that protect the environment, overburdened communities, and tribal resources; bring benefits to the communities that host clean energy projects; and facilitate the rapid transition to clean energy that is required to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on Washington's people and places. There is no single solution for improved siting and permitting processes. Rather, a variety of efforts and investments will help bring together state, local, tribal, and federal governments, communities, workers, clean energy project developers, and others to succeed in this essential task.

3. Efficient and effective siting and permitting will benefit from early and meaningful community and tribal engagement, and from up-front planning including identification of least-conflict sites, and programmatic environmental review that identifies measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate project impacts.

4. Incorporating the principles and strategies identified in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section, the legislature intends to invest in, facilitate, and require better coordinated, faster environmental review and permitting decisions by state and local governments.

5. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support efficient, effective siting and permitting of clean energy projects through a variety of interventions, including:

    a. Establishing an interagency clean energy siting coordinating council to improve siting and permitting of clean energy projects;

    b. Creating a designation for clean energy projects of statewide significance to provide benefits including a clean energy navigator and access to the initial assessment and fully coordinated permitting processes;

    c. Improving processes for review of clean energy projects under the state environmental policy act;

    d. Requiring preparation of a nonproject environmental impact statement for green electrolytic and renewable hydrogen projects statewide, and another for solar energy projects located in the Columbia Basin of central and eastern Washington, with the goal of preparing these nonproject environmental impact statements by June 30, 2025; and

    e. Requiring the Washington State University energy program to complete by June 30, 2025, a least-conflict siting process for pumped storage projects in Washington.

## Section 101

        ii. Reporting on the evaluation and recommendations in (a)(i) of this subsection to the governor and the legislature by July 1, 2024.

    b. Pursue development of a consolidated clean energy application similar to the joint aquatic resources permit application for, at a minimum, state permits needed for clean energy projects. The department of ecology shall lead this effort and engage with federal agencies and local governments to explore inclusion of federal and local permit applications as part of the consolidated application. The department may design a single consolidated application for multiple clean energy project types, may design separate applications for individual clean energy technologies, or may design an application for related resources. The department of ecology shall provide an update on its development of consolidated permit applications for clean energy projects to the governor and legislature by December 31, 2024.

    c. Explore development of a consolidated permit for clean energy projects. The department of ecology shall lead this effort and explore options including a clean energy project permit that consolidates department of ecology permits only, or that consolidates permits from multiple state and local agencies. The permit structure must identify criteria or conditions that must be met for projects to use the consolidated permit. The department of ecology may analyze criteria or conditions as part of a nonproject review under chapter 43.21C RCW. The department of ecology shall update the legislature on its evaluation of consolidated permit options and make recommendations by October 1, 2024.

The responsible official has no more than 30 days from the date of the resubmission of a clarified or changed application to make a threshold determination, unless the applicant makes material changes that substantially modify the impact of the proposal, in which case the responsible official must treat the resubmitted clarified or changed application as new, and is subject to the timelines established in RCW 43.21C.033.

    b. The notification required under (a) of this subsection is not an official determination by the lead agency and is not subject to appeal under this chapter.

    c. Nothing in this subsection amends the requirements of RCW 43.21C.033 as they apply to proposals that are not for clean energy projects and nothing in this subsection precludes the lead agency from allowing an applicant for a proposal that is not a clean energy project to follow application processes similar to or the same as the application processes identified in this subsection.

3. [Empty]

    a. When an environmental impact statement is required, a lead agency shall prepare a final environmental impact statement for clean energy projects within 24 months of a threshold determination of a probable significant, adverse environmental impact.

    b. A lead agency may work with clean energy project applicants to set or extend a time limit longer than 24 months under (a) of this subsection, provided the:

        i. Applicant agrees to a longer time limit; and

        ii. Responsible official for the lead agency maintains an updated schedule available for public review.

    c. For all clean energy projects that require the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the lead agency shall work collaboratively with applicants and all agencies that will have actions requiring review under this chapter to develop a schedule that shall:

        i. Include a list of, and roles and responsibilities for, all entities that have actions requiring review under this chapter for the project;

        ii. Include a comprehensive schedule of dates by which review under this chapter will be completed, all actions requiring review under this chapter will be taken, and the public will have an opportunity to participate;

        iii. Be completed within 60 days of issuance of a determination of significance;

        iv. Be updated as needed, but no later than 30 days of missing a date on the schedule; and

    v. Be available for public review on the state environmental policy act register.

    d. A lead agency may fulfill its responsibilities under this subsection with a coordinated project plan prepared pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4370m–2(c)(1) if it includes all dates identified under (c)(ii) of this subsection.

    e. A failure to comply with the requirements in this subsection is not subject to appeal and does not provide a basis for the invalidation of the review by an agency under this chapter. Nothing in this subsection creates any civil liability for an agency or creates a new cause of action against an agency.

    f. For clean energy projects, the provisions of this subsection are in addition to the requirements of RCW 43.21C.0311.

4. This subsection provides clarifications on the content of review under this chapter specific to clean energy projects.

    a. In defining the proposal that is the subject of review under this chapter, a lead agency may not combine the evaluation of a clean energy project proposal with other proposals unless the:

        i. Proposals are closely related; or

        ii. Applicant agrees to combining the proposals' evaluation.

    b. An agency with authority to impose mitigation under RCW 43.21C.060 may require mitigation measures for clean energy projects only to address the environmental impacts that are attributable to and caused by a proposal and that are additional relative to the environmental impacts that would occur in the absence of the proposal.

    c. Unless requested by the applicant, an agency with authority to impose mitigation under RCW 43.21C.060 for a clean energy project may not reopen, reconsider, or otherwise modify mitigation that was required in connection with a local, state, or federal permit or authorization. This subsection (4)(c) does not apply to modifications of mitigation that were anticipated as part of an adaptive management strategy in a previously issued permit or authorization.

## Section 302
1. The department of ecology shall prepare nonproject environmental impact statements, pursuant to RCW 43.21C.030, that assess and disclose the probable significant adverse environmental impacts, and that identify related mitigation measures, for each of the following categories of projects:

    a. Green electrolytic or renewable hydrogen projects; and

    b. Solar energy projects located in the Columbia Basin of eastern and central Washington. The nonproject environmental impact statement for solar energy projects in the Columbia Basin of eastern and central Washington will consider the findings of the Washington State University least-conflict solar siting process.

2. The nonproject environmental impact statements must include:

    a. Identification of probable significant impacts by geographic location;

    b. Identification of cumulative impacts to landscape-scale habitat and habitat connectivity corridors; and

    c. Identification of measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate probable significant impacts identified during the review. These include impacts to elements of the environment as defined in WAC 197-11-444 as it existed as of January 1, 2023, tribal resources as identified in RCW 70A.65.305, and overburdened communities as defined in RCW 70A.02.010.

3. The department of ecology must determine the scope of the nonproject environmental impact statements based on input from industry, local governments, federally recognized Indian tribes, and stakeholders. The department of ecology will provide opportunities for the engagement of tribes, overburdened communities, and stakeholders that self-identify an interest in participating in the processes. The department of ecology will offer early and meaningful consultation with any affected federally recognized tribe on potential impacts to tribal resources.

4. Project proponents of solar energy project proposals in the Columbia Basin of eastern and central Washington and green electrolytic or renewable hydrogen project proposals must incorporate impact analyses from the nonproject reviews in the project-level review process undertaken pursuant to this chapter.

## Section 303
1. A lead agency conducting a project-level environmental review under this chapter of a solar energy project proposal in the Columbia Basin of eastern and central Washington or a green electrolytic or renewable hydrogen project proposal must adopt, where appropriate, a nonproject environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to section 302 of this act in order to identify and mitigate project-level probable significant impacts.

2. The project-level environmental review process conducted pursuant to this chapter of a solar energy project proposal in the Columbia Basin of eastern and central Washington or a green electrolytic or renewable hydrogen project proposal must address any probable significant impacts that were not analyzed in the nonproject environmental impact statements prepared pursuant to section 302 of this act and must identify any avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures specific to the project for those probable significant impacts.

3. When preparing a project-level environmental review, the lead agency shall review the nonproject environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to section 302 of this act to ensure that the analysis is valid when applied to the current proposal, knowledge, and technology. If it is not valid, the analysis must be reanalyzed in the project environmental review.

## Section 304
During project review of a project to construct or improve facilities for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity, a local government may not require a project applicant to demonstrate the necessity or utility of the project other than to require, as part of a completed application under RCW 36.70B.070(2), submission of any publicly available documentation required by the federal energy regulatory commission or its delegees or the utilities and transportation commission or its delegees, or from any other federal agency with regulatory authority over the assessment of electric power transmission and distribution needs as applicable.

## Section 305
1. Washington State University energy program shall conduct a least-conflict pumped storage siting process for Washington state, to support expanded capacity to store intermittently produced renewable energy such as from wind and solar, as part of the state's transition from fossil fuel to 100 percent clean energy. The Washington State University energy program may decide to include within the process's scope the colocation of pumped storage with wind or solar energy generation. The goal of the process is to identify areas where there is the least amount of potential conflict in the siting of pumped storage.

2. In carrying out this process, the Washington State University energy program shall provide ample opportunities for the engagement of federally recognized Indian tribes and stakeholders that self-identify as interested in participating in the process.

3. The Washington State University energy program must develop and make available a map and associated GIS data layers, highlighting areas identified through the process.

4. Any information provided by tribes will help to inform the map product, but the Washington State University energy program may not include sensitive tribal information, as identified by federally recognized Indian tribes, in the publicly available map or GIS data layers. The siting process and creation of the map under this section does not supplant the need for project developers to conduct early and individual outreach to federally recognized Indian tribes. The Washington State University energy program must take precautions to prevent disclosure of any sensitive tribal information it receives during the process, consistent with RCW 42.56.300.

5. The least-conflict pumped storage process must be completed by June 30, 2025.

## Section 403
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
