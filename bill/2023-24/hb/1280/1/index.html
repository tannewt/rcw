<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act requires an official motor vehicle inspection facility or licensed private inspection facility to provide written notice to the owner of a motor vehicle being inspected for all open safety recalls applicable to the motor vehicle at the time the motor vehicle is inspected. The recall notice must include a description of each open safety recall and a statement that each open safety recall may be repaired by certain motor vehicle dealers at no cost to the owner, except in certain circumstances. This act requires the department of licensing to provide written notice to the owner of a motor vehicle, at the time a vehicle is registered or upon mailing a motor vehicle's registration renewal notice, of all open safety recalls applicable to the motor vehicle. The recall notice is to include a description of each open safety recall; a statement that each open safety recall may be repaired by certain motor vehicle dealers at no cost to the owner, except in certain circumstances; and a statement that, except in certain circumstances, the department of licensing will not renew a registration certificate for the motor vehicle until each open safety recall is repaired.</p>
<p>Under this act, the owner is required to obtain the necessary repairs before the motor vehicle's next registration renewal and must self-attest to having obtained such repairs annually, for the life of the recall. The director of the department of licensing is required to deny an application for registration renewal if the open safety recalls have not been remedied by the next registration renewal except if certain exemptions apply.</p>
<p>Nothing in this act may alter the liability of any motor vehicle manufacturer or motor vehicle dealer approved by a manufacturer to repair an open safety recall. This act limits the liability of certain individuals for acts or omissions related to open safety recall notices provided pursuant to the provisions of this act, except in cases of gross negligence.</p>

The recall notice must include the following:</p>
