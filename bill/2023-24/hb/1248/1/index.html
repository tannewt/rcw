<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each district's annual student transportation allocation shall be determined by the superintendent of public instruction in the following manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent shall annually calculate the transportation allocation for those services provided for in RCW 28A.160.150. The allocation formula may be adjusted based on reimbursements for allowable special passenger expenditures provided under subsection (2)(c) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The allocation shall be equal to the greater of the sum of (a) and (b) of this subsection, multiplied by the school district's regionalization factor under RCW 28A.150.410(9), and (c) of this subsection, or the school district's transportation allocation in the 2022-23 school year increased annually by the transportation inflation factor.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>$1,900, increased annually from the 2022-23 school year by the transportation inflation factor, multiplied by the average number of riders to and from school in the previous school year, multiplied by 0.86.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$0.82, increased annually from the 2022-23 school year by the transportation inflation factor, multiplied by the total mileage transporting students to and from school, multiplied by 0.14.</p>

Allocations for reimbursement of allowable transportation expenditures for special passengers must be provided as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Allocations for reimbursable transportation expenditures under this subsection (2)(c) must be provided monthly. Allocations from September to December of a school year under this subsection (2)(c)(i) must be based on expenditures reported under RCW 28A.160.170(2) for the prior school year. Allocations after December must be adjusted based on monthly reports under RCW 28A.160.170(2) in the current school year so that districts receive allocations for all reimbursable transportation expenditures under this subsection (2)(c) within a school year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction must recover amounts that were distributed prospectively under this subsection (2)(c) that exceed the school district's total allowable pupil transportation expenditures for that school year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transportation allocation for transporting students in district-owned passenger cars, as defined in RCW 46.04.382, pursuant to RCW 28A.160.010 for services provided for in RCW 28A.160.150 if a school district deems it advisable to use such vehicles after the school district board of directors has considered the safety of the students being transported as well as the economy of utilizing a district-owned passenger car in lieu of a school bus is the private vehicle reimbursement rate in effect on September 1st of each school year. Students transported in district-owned passenger cars must be included in the corresponding basic or special passenger counts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to June 1st of each year the superintendent shall submit to the office of financial management, and the education and fiscal committees of the legislature, a report outlining the methodology and rationale used in determining the statistical coefficients for each site characteristic used to determine the allocation for the following year.</p>

<p>By January 1, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction will provide an analysis of school district transportation costs and allocations following the 2023-24 school year to the education and fiscal committees of the house of representatives and senate.

The legislature intends this data to inform their future discussions and reviews of the overall student transportation allocation model to remain transparent and predictable.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
