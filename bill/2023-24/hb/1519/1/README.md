# HB 1519 - Local project review

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1519.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that delays in the processing of permits increases the cost of housing. The legislature also finds that Washington is in a housing crisis for all types of housing. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure predictable and consistent permit processes by creating a system of accountability, metrics, and best practices for local governments to follow when reviewing a permit application. The legislature finds that Washington's cities and counties may need assistance and resources for adopting these best practices and ensuring predictable permit timelines, so it is the intent of the legislature to provide assistance and resources for local governments to be successful in processing permits. The legislature acknowledges that permitting is necessary for the health and safety of our communities now and into the future. Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature to encourage new home construction of all types through permit process improvements, so Washington's builders can build Washington's future neighborhoods safely and more quickly.

## Section 2
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Closed record appeal" means an administrative appeal on the record to a local government body or officer, including the legislative body, following an open record hearing on a project permit application when the appeal is on the record with no or limited new evidence or information allowed to be submitted and only appeal argument allowed.

2. "Local government" means a county, city, or town.

3. "Open record hearing" means a hearing, conducted by a single hearing body or officer authorized by the local government to conduct such hearings, that creates the local government's record through testimony and submission of evidence and information, under procedures prescribed by the local government by ordinance or resolution. An open record hearing may be held prior to a local government's decision on a project permit to be known as an "open record predecision hearing." An open record hearing may be held on an appeal, to be known as an "open record appeal hearing," if no open record predecision hearing has been held on the project permit.

4. "Project permit" or "project permit application" means any land use or environmental permit or license required from a local government for a project action, including but not limited to  subdivisions, binding site plans, planned unit developments, conditional uses, shoreline substantial development permits, site plan review, permits or approvals required by critical area ordinances, or site-specific rezones that do not require a comprehensive plan amendment. "Project permit" or "project permit application" does not include building permits or the adoption or amendment of a comprehensive plan, subarea plan, or development regulations except as otherwise specifically included in this subsection.

5. "Public meeting" means an informal meeting, hearing, workshop, or other public gathering of people to obtain comments from the public or other agencies on a proposed project permit prior to the local government's decision. A public meeting may include, but is not limited to, a design review or architectural control board meeting, a special review district or community council meeting, or a scoping meeting on a draft environmental impact statement. A public meeting does not include an open record hearing. The proceedings at a public meeting may be recorded and a report or recommendation may be included in the local government's project permit application file.

Additional information or studies may be required or project modifications may be undertaken subsequent to the procedural review of the application by the local government. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the local government from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the notice of completeness or subsequently if new information is required or substantial changes in the proposed action occur. However, if the procedural submission requirements, as outlined on the project permit application, have been provided, the need for additional information or studies does not preclude a completeness determination.

3. The determination of completeness may include or be combined with the following :

    a. A preliminary determination of those development regulations that will be used for project mitigation;

    b. A preliminary determination of consistency, as provided under RCW 36.70B.040;

    a. When permit time frames provided for in subsection (1)(d) of this section, as may be amended by a local government, for issuing a final decision are not met, a portion of the permit fee must be refunded to the applicant as provided for in this subsection (2). A local government may provide for the collection of only 80 percent of the fee initially, and for the collection of the remaining balance if the permitting time frames are met. The portion of the fee refunded for missing time frames shall be:

        i. 10 percent if the final decision on the project permit application was made after the applicable deadline but the period from the passage of the deadline to the time of the issuance of the final decision did not exceed 20 percent of the original time frame.

        ii. 20 percent if the period from the passage of the deadline to the time of the issuance of the final decision exceeded 20 percent of the original time frame.

(1) Not later than April 1, 1996, a local government planning under RCW 36.70A.040 shall provide a notice of application to the public and the departments and agencies with jurisdiction as provided in this section. If a local government has made a threshold determination under chapter 43.21C RCW concurrently with the notice of application, the notice of application may be combined with the threshold determination and the scoping notice for a determination of significance. Nothing in this section prevents a determination of significance and scoping notice from being issued prior to the notice of application. Nothing in this section or this chapter prevents a lead agency, when it is a project proponent or is funding a project, from conducting its review under chapter 43.21C RCW or from allowing appeals of procedural determinations prior to submitting a project permit.
