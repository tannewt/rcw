<li>
<p>A diagnostic evaluation and treatment recommendation shall be prepared under the direction of the court by a substance use disorder treatment program licensed or certified by the department of health or a qualified probation department approved by the department of social and health services. A copy of the report shall be forwarded to the court. Based on the diagnostic evaluation, the court shall determine whether the person shall be required to complete a course in an alcohol and drug information school licensed or certified by the department of health or more intensive treatment in an approved treatment program licensed or certified by the department of health.</p>

<p>If it appears to the prosecuting attorney or the court, that the sentenced individual is performing unsatisfactorily in the recommended treatment program, the prosecuting attorney, or the court on its own, shall make a motion for a hearing to consider sanctions. After notice to the sentenced individual, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if a sanction or revocation of the individual's suspended sentence, or any part thereof, is warranted under RCW 3.50.340 or 3.66.069.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds the sentenced individual has made reasonable efforts to comply with the recommended treatment but cannot comply either due to a lack of available treatment or, for sentenced individuals found to be indigent by the court, due to a lack of funding for treatment, no sanction for a failure to comply with the recommended treatment may include jail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For individuals sentenced under subsection (1)(a) of this section, if at any point the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the sentenced individual has willfully abandoned or demonstrated a consistent failure to comply with the recommended treatment, the court shall reinstate a term of imprisonment of no less than 45 days of the individual's suspended sentence to be served in total confinement and terminate the individual's probation. For individuals sentenced under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the court may deem any subsequent charge filed against the individual for violation of RCW 69.50.4011(1)(b), 69.50.4013, or 69.41.030 a willful abandonment of treatment.</p>

<p>In courts of limited jurisdiction, an individual charged with violating RCW 69.50.4011(1)(b), 69.50.4013, or 69.41.030, who subsequently enrolls in and completes a substance use disorder treatment program licensed or certified by the department of health and files proof of completion with the court prior to conviction on the charge, may make a motion to dismiss the charge. Upon verification that the individual successfully completed the substance use disorder treatment program, the court must grant the motion and dismiss the charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the individual has successfully completed the recommended treatment program, the individual must file proof of successful completion with the court at which time the court must terminate probation and enter an order vacating the individual's conviction under RCW 9.96.060(6).</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>

<p>When vacating a conviction under this section, the court effectuates the vacation by: (a)(i) Permitting the applicant to withdraw the applicant's plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty; or (ii) if the applicant has been convicted after a plea of not guilty, the court setting aside the verdict of guilty; and (b) the court dismissing the information, indictment, complaint, or citation against the applicant and vacating the judgment and sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every person convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the applicant's record of conviction for the offense. If the court finds the applicant meets the requirements of this subsection, the court may in its discretion vacate the record of conviction. Except as provided in subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section, an applicant may not have the record of conviction for a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense vacated if any one of the following is present:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The offense was any misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor violation, including attempt, of chapter 9.68 RCW (obscenity and pornography), chapter 9.68A RCW (sexual exploitation of children), or chapter 9A.44 RCW (sex offenses), except for failure to register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.132;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant was convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense as defined in RCW 10.99.020, or the court determines after a review of the court file that the offense was committed by one family or household member against another or by one intimate partner against another, or the court, after considering the damage to person or property that resulted in the conviction, any prior convictions for crimes defined in RCW 10.99.020, or for comparable offenses in another state or in federal court, and the totality of the records under review by the court regarding the conviction being considered for vacation, determines that the offense involved domestic violence, and any one of the following factors exist:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The applicant has not provided written notification of the vacation petition to the prosecuting attorney's office that prosecuted the offense for which vacation is sought, or has not provided that notification to the court;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant has two or more domestic violence convictions stemming from different incidents. For purposes of this subsection, however, if the current application is for more than one conviction that arose out of a single incident, none of those convictions counts as a previous conviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant has signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury affirming that the applicant has not previously had a conviction for a domestic violence offense, and a criminal history check reveals that the applicant has had such a conviction; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less than five years have elapsed since the person completed the terms of the original conditions of the sentence, including any financial obligations and successful completion of any treatment ordered as a condition of sentencing;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any offense other than those described in (f) of this subsection, less than three years have passed since the person completed the terms of the sentence, including any financial obligations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offender has been convicted of a new crime in this state, another state, or federal or tribal court in the three years prior to the vacation application; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant is currently restrained by a domestic violence protection order, a no-contact order, an antiharassment order, or a civil restraining order which restrains one party from contacting the other party or was previously restrained by such an order and was found to have committed one or more violations of the order in the five years prior to the vacation application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the applicant is a victim of sex trafficking, prostitution, or commercial sexual abuse of a minor; sexual assault; or domestic violence as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, or the prosecutor applies on behalf of the state, the sentencing court may vacate the record of conviction if the application satisfies the requirements of RCW 9.96.080. When preparing or filing the petition, the prosecutor is not deemed to be providing legal advice or legal assistance on behalf of the victim, but is fulfilling an administrative function on behalf of the state in order to further their responsibility to seek to reform and improve the administration of criminal justice. A record of conviction vacated using the process in RCW 9.96.080 is subject to subsections  (7) and (8) of this section.</p>

If the person is deceased, a member of the person's family or an official representative of the tribe of which the person was a member may apply to the court on behalf of the deceased person. Notwithstanding the requirements of RCW 9.94A.640, the court shall vacate the record of conviction if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The applicant is a member of a tribe that may exercise treaty Indian fishing rights at the location where the offense occurred; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state has been enjoined from taking enforcement action of the statute or rule to the extent that it interferes with a treaty Indian fishing right as determined under , 384 F. Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), or , 302 F. Supp. 899 (D. Oregon 1969), and any posttrial orders of those courts, or any other state supreme court or federal court decision.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Every person convicted of a misdemeanor cannabis offense, who was twenty-one years of age or older at the time of the offense, may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the applicant's record of conviction for the offense.

If an applicant qualifies under this subsection, the court shall vacate the record of conviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an individual who successfully completes a substance use disorder treatment program as required under section 5 of this act files proof of completion with the court, upon verification that the individual successfully completed the substance use disorder treatment program, the court must vacate the conviction or convictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who is a family member of a homicide victim may apply to the sentencing court on the behalf of the victim for vacation of the victim's record of conviction for prostitution under RCW 9A.88.030.

<p>Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, once the court vacates a record of conviction under this section, the person shall be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense and the fact that the person has been convicted of the offense shall not be included in the person's criminal history for purposes of determining a sentence in any subsequent conviction. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment or housing applications, a person whose conviction has been vacated under this section may state that he or she has never been convicted of that crime. However, nothing in this section affects the requirements for restoring a right to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.040. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, nothing in this section affects or prevents the use of an offender's prior conviction in a later criminal prosecution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a court vacates a record of domestic violence as defined in RCW 10.99.020 under this section, the state may not use the vacated conviction in a later criminal prosecution unless the conviction was for: (i) Violating the provisions of a restraining order, no-contact order, or protection order restraining or enjoining the person or restraining the person from going on to the grounds of or entering a residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibiting the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location, a protected party's person, or a protected party's vehicle (RCW 10.99.040, 10.99.050, 26.09.300, 26.26B.050, 26.44.063, 26.44.150, or 26.52.070, or any of the former RCW 26.50.060, 26.50.070, 26.50.130, and 74.34.145); (ii) stalking (RCW 9A.46.110); or (iii) a domestic violence protection order or vulnerable adult protection order entered under chapter 7.105 RCW. A vacated conviction under this section is not considered a conviction of such an offense for the purposes of 27 C.F.R. 478.11.</p>

<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When a police officer has reasonable cause to believe that the individual has committed acts constituting a crime, and the individual is known by history or consultation with the behavioral health administrative services organization, managed care organization, crisis hotline, local crisis services providers, or community health providers to have a mental disorder or substance use disorder, in addition to existing authority under state law or local policy, as an alternative to arrest, the arresting officer is authorized and encouraged to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Take the individual to a crisis stabilization unit as defined in RCW 71.05.020. Individuals delivered to a crisis stabilization unit pursuant to this section may be held by the facility for a period of up to twelve hours. The individual must be examined by a mental health professional or substance use disorder professional within three hours of arrival;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the individual to a triage facility as defined in RCW 71.05.020. An individual delivered to a triage facility which has elected to operate as an involuntary facility may be held up to a period of twelve hours. The individual must be examined by a mental health professional or substance use disorder professional within three hours of arrival;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refer the individual to a designated crisis responder for evaluation for initial detention and proceeding under chapter 71.05 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release the individual upon agreement to voluntary participation in outpatient treatment;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the individual is released to the community from the facilities in subsection (1)(a) through (c) of this section, the mental health provider or substance use disorder professional shall make reasonable efforts to inform the arresting officer of the planned release prior to release if the arresting officer has specifically requested notification and provided contact information to the provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In deciding whether to refer the individual to treatment under this section, the police officer must be guided by local law enforcement diversion guidelines for behavioral health developed and mutually agreed upon with the prosecuting authority with an opportunity for consultation and comment by the defense bar and disability community. These guidelines must address, at a minimum, the length, seriousness, and recency of the known criminal history of the individual, the mental health history of the individual, if available, the substance use disorder history of the individual, if available, the opinions of a mental health professional, if available, the opinions of a substance use disorder professional, if available, and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offense. The guidelines must include a process for clearing outstanding warrants or referring the individual for assistance in clearing outstanding warrants, if any, and issuing a new court date, if appropriate, without booking or incarcerating the individual or disqualifying the individual from referral to treatment under this section, and define the circumstances under which such action is permissible. Referrals to services, care, and treatment for substance use disorder must be made in accordance with protocols developed for the recovery navigator program described in RCW 71.24.115.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any agreement to participate in treatment or services in lieu of jail booking or referring a case for prosecution shall not require individuals to stipulate to any of the alleged facts regarding the criminal activity as a prerequisite to participation in the alternative response described in this section. Any agreement is inadmissible in any criminal or civil proceeding. Such agreements do not create immunity from prosecution for the alleged criminal activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are required terms of participation in the services or treatment to which an individual was referred under this section, and if the individual violates such terms and is therefore no longer participating in services:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The behavioral health or service provider shall inform the referring law enforcement agency of the violation, if consistent with  applicable law; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The original charges may be filed or referred to the prosecutor, as appropriate, and the matter may proceed accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>The police officer is immune from liability for any good faith conduct under this section.</p>
