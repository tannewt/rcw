<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that packaging designs and materials have changed and the way Washington's residents use, consume, and manage materials when no longer wanted has also changed significantly in recent years. These shifts have created unintended consequences, such as the deterioration of ecosystems regionally and worldwide, as well as increased levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change, and reductions in human well-being, especially for the most vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that convenient and environmentally sound extended producer responsibility programs that include collecting, transporting, reusing, and recycling, or the proper end-of-life management of unwanted products help protect Washington's environment and the health of state residents. In general, the state's waste management hierarchy establishes that products should be managed in a manner where a priority is placed on prevention, waste reduction, source reduction, reuse, and recycling over energy recovery and landfill disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many residents, particularly those who live in rural areas and in multifamily residences, do not have access to convenient or affordable curbside recycling, and must rely on taking recyclables to drop box locations, and that extended producer responsibility programs could make curbside recycling available and affordable for most people in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the department of ecology was directed, through an independent consultant, to study how plastic packaging is managed in the state, assess various policy options, and that the study recommendations included establishing an extended producer responsibility policy for all consumer packaging and paper products with a framework that makes producers responsible for achieving specific management and environmental outcomes for the packaging and paper products they supply into Washington state, as well as recommending that postconsumer recycled content requirements and a deposit return system for beverage containers be established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the legislature finds extended producer responsibility policies designed to cover all consumer packaging and paper materials offer the potential for greater economies of scale and operational efficiencies than could be achieved under a policy applied only to a subset of materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to require that extended producer responsibility programs, including the achievement of recycling rates, are implemented by and for producers of consumer packaging and paper products in a manner that involves producers in material management from design concept to end-of-life. These programs incentivize innovation and research to develop more efficient recycling technologies and minimize environmental impacts of the packaging and paper products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also intended that these programs be responsibly managed, so that covered products are handled and accounted for from the point of collection through the final destination in a way that benefits the environment and minimizes risks to public health and worker health and safety. It is intended that these programs build and expand on the existing waste and recycling system's infrastructure and reliance on the role of local governments and the utilities and transportation commission in solid waste management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the intent of the legislature that producers increase the use of postconsumer recycled content in their products, to achieve the goals in RCW 70A.520.010(2), in order to create strong markets for recycled materials and achieve environmental benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, it is the intent of the legislature that, through design and innovation, producers will reduce the use and climate impact of consumer packaging and paper products, increase the use of postconsumer recycled content, and make all packaging reusable, recyclable, or compostable. The legislature intends that the policy of the state is to achieve, by 2035, an overall recycling and reuse rate of 90 percent for consumer packaging and paper products.</p>

<p>Continuing technological changes in methods of manufacture, packaging, and marketing of consumer products, together with the economic and population growth of this state, the rising affluence of its citizens, and its expanding industrial activity have created new and ever-mounting problems involving disposal of garbage, refuse, and solid waste materials resulting from domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traditional methods of disposing of solid wastes in this state are no longer adequate to meet the ever-increasing problem. Improper methods and practices of handling and disposal of solid wastes pollute our land, air and water resources, blight our countryside, adversely affect land values, and damage the overall quality of our environment.</p>

<li>
<p>Considerations of natural resource limitations, energy shortages, economics and the environment make necessary the development and implementation of solid waste recovery and/or recycling plans and programs.</p>

<p>It is the state's goal that programs be established to eliminate residential or commercial yard debris in landfills by 2012 in those areas where alternatives to disposal are readily available and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste.</p>

<p>A contamination reduction and outreach plan. The contamination reduction and outreach plan must address reducing contamination in recycling. Except for counties with a population of twenty-five thousand or fewer, by July 1, 2021, a contamination reduction and outreach plan must be included in each solid waste management plan by a plan amendment or included when revising or updating a solid waste management plan developed under this chapter. Jurisdictions may adopt the state's contamination reduction and outreach plan as developed under RCW 70A.205.070 or participate in a producer responsibility organization's plan in lieu of creating their own plan. In comprehensive solid waste management plans that are newly developed, updated, or amended after July 1, 2027, a jurisdiction must reference the plans of producer responsibility organizations established in the jurisdiction under chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 601 of this act) and any plans of distributor responsibility organizations under chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 603 of this act). A recycling contamination reduction and outreach plan must include the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A list of actions for reducing contamination in recycling programs for single-family and multiple-family residences, commercial locations, and drop boxes depending on the jurisdictions system components;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of key contaminants identified by the jurisdiction or identified by the department;</p>
</li>

<p>A solid waste collection company shall not operate for the hauling of solid waste for compensation without first having obtained from the commission a certificate declaring that public convenience and necessity require such operation. Operating for the hauling of solid waste for compensation includes advertising, soliciting, offering, or entering into an agreement to provide that service. To operate a solid waste collection company in the unincorporated areas of a county, the company must comply with the solid waste management plan prepared under chapter 70A.205 RCW in the company's franchise area and, if applicable, the service standards established in an approved producer responsibility organization plan to meet the requirements of chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 601 of this act).</p>
<p>Issuance of the certificate of necessity must be determined on, but not limited to, the following factors: The present service and the cost thereof for the contemplated area to be served; an estimate of the cost of the facilities to be utilized in the plant for solid waste collection and disposal, set out in an affidavit or declaration; a statement of the assets on hand of the person, firm, association, or corporation that will be expended on the purported plant for solid waste collection and disposal, set out in an affidavit or declaration; a statement of prior experience, if any, in such field by the petitioner, set out in an affidavit or declaration; and sentiment in the community contemplated to be served as to the necessity for such a service.</p>
<p>When an applicant requests a certificate to operate in a territory already served by a certificate holder under this chapter, the commission may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, issue the certificate only if the existing solid waste collection company or companies serving the territory will not provide service to the satisfaction of the commission or if the existing solid waste collection company does not object.</p>
<p>In all other cases, the commission may, with or without hearing, issue certificates, or for good cause shown refuse to issue them, or issue them for the partial exercise only of the privilege sought, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted such terms and conditions as, in its judgment, the public convenience and necessity may require.</p>
<p>Any right, privilege, certificate held, owned, or obtained by a solid waste collection company may be sold, assigned, leased, transferred, or inherited as other property, only if authorized by the commission.</p>
<p>For purposes of issuing certificates under this chapter, the commission may adopt categories of solid wastes as follows: Garbage, refuse, recyclable materials, and demolition debris. A certificate may be issued for one or more categories of solid waste. Certificates issued on or before July 23, 1989, shall not be expanded or restricted by operation of this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="section-504">Section 504 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-504">¶</a></h2>
<p>The board, subject to the provisions of this chapter, must adopt rules that establish the procedures and criteria necessary to implement the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Licensing of cannabis producers, cannabis processors, and cannabis retailers, including prescribing forms and establishing application, reinstatement, and renewal fees.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Application forms for cannabis producers must request the applicant to state whether the applicant intends to produce cannabis for sale by cannabis retailers holding medical cannabis endorsements and the amount of or percentage of canopy the applicant intends to commit to growing plants determined by the department under RCW 69.50.375 to be of a THC concentration, CBD concentration, or THC to CBD ratio appropriate for cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, or cannabis-infused products sold to qualifying patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board must reconsider and increase limits on the amount of square feet permitted to be in production on July 24, 2015, and increase the percentage of production space for those cannabis producers who intend to grow plants for cannabis retailers holding medical cannabis endorsements if the cannabis producer designates the increased production space to plants determined by the department under RCW 69.50.375 to be of a THC concentration, CBD concentration, or THC to CBD ratio appropriate for cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, or cannabis-infused products to be sold to qualifying patients. If current cannabis producers do not use all the increased production space, the board may reopen the license period for new cannabis producer license applicants but only to those cannabis producers who agree to grow plants for cannabis retailers holding medical cannabis endorsements. Priority in licensing must be given to cannabis producer license applicants who have an application pending on July 24, 2015, but who are not yet licensed and then to new cannabis producer license applicants. After January 1, 2017, any reconsideration of the limits on the amount of square feet permitted to be in production to meet the medical needs of qualifying patients must consider information contained in the medical cannabis authorization database established in RCW 69.51A.230;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Security and safety issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provision of adequate access to licensed sources of cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, and cannabis-infused products to discourage purchases from the illegal market; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of retail outlets holding medical cannabis endorsements necessary to meet the medical needs of qualifying patients. The board must reconsider and increase the maximum number of retail outlets it established before July 24, 2015, and allow for a new license application period and a greater number of retail outlets to be permitted in order to accommodate the medical needs of qualifying patients and designated providers. After January 1, 2017, any reconsideration of the maximum number of retail outlets needed to meet the medical needs of qualifying patients must consider information contained in the medical cannabis authorization database established in RCW 69.51A.230;</p>

<li>
<p>In consultation with the department of agriculture and the department, establishing classes of cannabis, cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, and cannabis infused products according to grade, condition, cannabinoid profile, THC concentration, CBD concentration, or other qualitative measurements deemed appropriate by the board;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions and requirements regarding advertising of cannabis, cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, and cannabis-infused products that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, taking into consideration:</p>
