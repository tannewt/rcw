## Section 714
OFFICE SPACE USE REDUCTION.

1. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Washington state agencies rapidly implemented telework for employees whose job duties did not require on-site presence. This shift in state government operations has led to agencies' reevaluation of the amount of physical office space they will require as they implement hybrid work environments and adopt expanded telework  opportunities.

2. To meet the goal of efficient use of state funds and office space, state agencies, institutions of higher education, and separately elected officials must adhere to the office of financial management's statewide space use policy, data integrity and system access policy, inventory policy, and the human resource management system data validation guide to ensure space use data is complete, accurate, and consistent for reporting and analysis.

3. Institutions of higher education and separately elected officials with leases expiring in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 must work toward reducing leased office space a minimum of 20 percent upon lease renewal or when requesting office relocation.  Reductions in lease costs will be reflected in subsequent budgets.

4. It is the intent of the legislature that agencies, institutions of higher education, and separately elected officials with leases expiring in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 work to reduce their office space portfolio a minimum of 30 percent upon lease renewal or when requesting office relocation.  The reductions in costs will be reflected in subsequent budgets.

5. Agencies must complete the following:

    a. Work with the office of financial management facilities oversight and the department of enterprise services to backfill office space and reduce full leases.

    b. Update monthly the office of financial management's facilities portfolio management tool to maximize collocation opportunities and better inform decision-making.

    c. Update telework and employee location data monthly in the human resource management system to reflect office space use and needs.

    d. Maintain a telework policy in accordance with executive order 16-07, building a modern work environment.

6. The anticipated general fund savings from office space reduction in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 is $5,260,000.

7. The anticipated general fund savings from office space reduction in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 is $14,557,000.
