## Section 1
1. The department shall maintain a vulnerable adult abuse registry. Upon request of any person, the department may disclose the identity of a person who has been entered on the registry with a final substantiated finding of abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable adult. This information must also be shared with the department of health to advance the purposes of chapter 18.88B RCW.

2. The department must develop a process in rule by which the department may remove individuals from the vulnerable adult abuse registry. The process must not allow a removal that would conflict with federal law.

3. Except as described in subsection (4) of this section, a person who is on the vulnerable adult abuse registry may petition the department, in writing, for removal from the registry after three years have elapsed from the date on which the final substantiated finding is entered.

4. A person may not petition the department to be removed from the registry if:

    a. The final substantiated finding that the person abused, abandoned, neglected, or financially exploited a vulnerable adult included information that:

        i. The person sexually abused a vulnerable adult;

        ii. The abuse or neglect caused a vulnerable adult to suffer great bodily harm or death;

        iii. The person financially exploited a vulnerable adult of property, resources, or services exceeding $5,000; or

    d. The person is a nursing assistant whose name is on the registry for conduct committed while working as a certified nursing assistant in a nursing or skilled nursing facility, unless the removal from the registry maintained by the department under 42 C.F.R. Sec. 483.156 would be authorized under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395i-3(g)(1)(D) or Sec. 1396r(g)(1)(D).

5. A person may petition the department for removal from the vulnerable adult abuse registry a maximum of three times and may only file one petition in any 12-month period.

6. If the petition is granted, the individual is removed from the vulnerable adult abuse registry and the individual is no longer disqualified from employment under RCW 74.39A.056 or 18.20.125 by reason of the final substantiated finding. Nothing in this subsection affects a finding against the individual that is on the registry maintained by the department under 42 C.F.R. Sec. 483.156 unless removal from that registry is permitted by 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395i-3(g)(1)(D) or Sec. 1396r(g)(1)(D).

7. If the department removes an individual from the vulnerable adult abuse registry, the department shall maintain a record of the individual and the underlying finding. These records are exempt from the disclosure described under subsection (1) of this section and chapter 42.56 RCW.

This section does not modify an applicant's right to seek review of an agency's licensing or certification decision under the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, or other applicable statute or agency rule.

    b. A person denied removal from the vulnerable adult abuse registry has the right to an adjudicative proceeding, and to judicial review of that adjudicative proceeding, to challenge the denial pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW. In any such proceeding, it is the appellant's burden to prove that the appellant should be removed from the registry.

        ii. Facts related to the underlying finding, including the underlying finding itself.

    b. Any documents that existed before a petition for removal was filed or that were created independently of the department's review and consideration of such petition do not become inadmissible merely because they were used during the department's review process.

10. An individual's removal from the vulnerable adult abuse registry does not require an employer to use that individual for the care of, or allow that individual unsupervised access to, vulnerable adults.

11. The department shall adopt rules necessary to implement this section.

12. Nothing in this section limits any rights or remedies available under federal law, including the removal of a name from the nurse aide registry under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395i-3(g)(1)(D).

13. This section does not create a protected class; private right of action; any right, privilege, or duty; or change any right, privilege, or duty existing under law.
