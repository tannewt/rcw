<li>
<p>The provisions of this chapter do not apply to persons engaging in one or more businesses taxable under this chapter whose total gross income is less than $4,000 for a monthly period or portion thereof.</p>

<p>Any person claiming exemption under this section may be required to file returns even though no tax may be due. If the total gross income for a taxable monthly period is $4,000, or more, no exemption or deductions from the gross operating revenue is allowed by this provision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning October 1, 2024, and each October 1st thereafter, the department shall adjust the threshold amount in subsection (1) of this section by multiplying the current threshold amount by one plus the percentage by which the most current consumer price index available on October 1st of the current year exceeds the consumer price index for the prior 12-month period and rounding the result to the nearest $10. If an adjustment under this subsection (3) would reduce the threshold amount in subsection (1) of this section, the department may not adjust the threshold amount for use in the following year. The department must publish the threshold amount on its public website by December 31st of each year. The adjusted threshold amount calculated under this subsection (3) applies to taxes due in the following calendar year.</p>
