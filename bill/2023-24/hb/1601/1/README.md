# HB 1601 - Parental rights

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1601.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the crucial role parents play in Washington state and in society as a whole. The legislature finds that parents are the primary stakeholders in their child's upbringing. As such, the legislature intends to make clear the rights parents have in this state to raise and educate their children in accordance with their own values and beliefs. The legislature further finds that creating transparency regarding these rights provides a necessary reminder for parents and the state of their different roles in the lives of children and that the more information parents have, the better decisions they can make concerning the care and upbringing of their children.

## Section 2
The state, any of its political subdivisions, or any other governmental entity may not infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health of his or her minor child without demonstrating that such action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and that such action is narrowly tailored and is not otherwise served by a less restrictive means.

## Section 3
1. All parental rights are reserved to the parents of a minor child in this state without obstruction or interference from the state, any of its political subdivisions, or any other governmental entity, including all of the following rights of a parent of a minor child in Washington state:

    a. The right to direct the education and care of his or her minor child.

    b. The right to direct the upbringing and the moral or religious training of his or her minor child.

    c. The right, pursuant to RCW 28A.225.010, to enroll his or her minor child in a public school or, as an alternative to public education, an approved private school, including a religious school, home-based instruction, or other available options as authorized by law.

    d. The right, pursuant to RCW 28A.605.030, to access and review all education records relating to his or her minor child.

    e. The right to make health care decisions for his or her minor child, unless otherwise prohibited by law.

    f. The right to access and review all medical records of his or her minor child, unless prohibited by law or if the parent is the subject of an investigation of a crime committed against the minor child and a law enforcement agency or official requests that the information not be released.

    g. The right to consent in writing before a biometric scan of his or her minor child is made, shared, or stored.

    h. The right to consent in writing before any record of his or her minor child's blood or DNA is created, stored, or shared, except as required by general law or authorized pursuant to a court order.

    i. The right to consent in writing before the state or any of its political subdivisions makes a video or voice recording of his or her minor child, unless the recording is made during or as part of a court proceeding or is made as part of a forensic interview in a criminal investigation or the department of children, youth, and families investigation or is to be used solely for the following purposes:

        i. A safety demonstration, including the maintenance of order and discipline in the common areas of a public school or on student transportation vehicles;

        ii. A purpose related to a legitimate academic or extracurricular activity;

        iii. A purpose related to regular classroom instructions;

        iv. Security or surveillance of buildings or grounds; or

    v. A photo identification card.

    j. The right to be notified promptly if an employee of the state, any of its political subdivisions, or any other governmental entity suspects that a criminal offense has been committed against his or her minor child, unless the incident has first been reported to law enforcement or the department of children, youth, and families and notifying the parent would impede the investigation.

2. This section does not:

    a. Authorize a parent of a minor child in this state to engage in conduct that is unlawful or to abuse or neglect his or her minor child in violation of general law;

    b. Condone, authorize, approve, or apply to a parental action or decision that would end life;

    c. Prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction, a law enforcement officer, or an employee of a government agency that is responsible for child welfare from acting in his or her official capacity within the reasonable and prudent scope of his or her authority; or

    d. Prohibit a court of competent jurisdiction from issuing an order that is otherwise permitted by law.

3. An employee of the state, any of its political subdivisions, or any other governmental entity who encourages or coerces, or attempts to encourage or coerce, a minor child to withhold information from his or her parent may be subject to disciplinary action.

4. A parent of a minor child has inalienable rights that are more comprehensive than those listed in this section, unless such rights have been legally waived or terminated. This chapter does not prescribe all rights to a parent of a minor child in this state. Unless required by law, the rights of a parent of a minor child in this state may not be limited or denied. This act may not be construed to apply to a parental action or decision that would end life.

## Section 7
The following conduct, acts, or conditions constitute unprofessional conduct for any license holder under the jurisdiction of this chapter:

1. The commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption relating to the practice of the person's profession, whether the act constitutes a crime or not. If the act constitutes a crime, conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to disciplinary action. Upon such a conviction, however, the judgment and sentence is conclusive evidence at the ensuing disciplinary hearing of the guilt of the license holder of the crime described in the indictment or information, and of the person's violation of the statute on which it is based. For the purposes of this section, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for the conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

3. All advertising which is false, fraudulent, or misleading;

5. Suspension, revocation, or restriction of the individual's license to practice any health care profession by competent authority in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, a certified copy of the order, stipulation, or agreement being conclusive evidence of the revocation, suspension, or restriction;
