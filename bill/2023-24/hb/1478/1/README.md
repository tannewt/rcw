# HB 1478 - Student rights

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1478.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that public education is a cornerstone of a healthy, diverse, and productive society. Public education is a transformative force that shapes the history and functioning of our nation, including its civic institutions, colleges and universities, and economy. Public education is also instrumental in helping to chart the course of progress for our nation's future.

2. Article IX of the Washington Constitution requires the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders. This requirement recognizes that public schools are foundational to our democracy, working in partnership with families and communities to shape the next generation of leaders into respectful and engaged critical thinkers.

3. The legislature finds that students, who rightly enjoy privileges and protections under the Constitutions and laws of the United States and the state of Washington, will benefit from a deeper awareness and knowledge of those rights, including their evolution and interpretation, and how they may be subject to extension or elimination through executive, legislative, or judicial actions.

4. Whether in matters of free speech, privacy, equal protection under the law, or voting rights, the engagement of an active citizenry is critical to our nation and its democratic ideals. Therefore, in recognition of the role that public education can play in providing students with information about their rights and about how to employ their rights for the betterment of education and society, the legislature intends to require each public school to develop student-focused educational and promotional materials, for communication and classroom use, that incorporate the statement of student rights established in section 2 of this act.
