# HB 1764 - Asphalt & agg. valuation

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/1764-S.PL.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that public road construction and repair is vital to the continued development of economic opportunity in this state.

2. The legislature finds that the vast majority of public road construction projects involve paving companies that self-manufacture the asphalt and aggregates used in public road construction projects. Because most of the asphalt and aggregates these companies produce is used for their own public road construction projects, the legislature finds that it is difficult to obtain objective, consistent, and reliable information regarding the market value of the asphalt and aggregates used in public road construction projects.

3. In light of the unique circumstances surrounding the valuation of self-manufactured asphalt and aggregates incorporated into public roads, the legislature intends to establish a method for valuing asphalt and aggregates that reduces the burdens on taxpayers and the department of revenue promotes certainty and consistency in the calculation of use tax and business and occupation tax on self-manufactured asphalt and aggregates across the paving industry.

## Section 2

The term also includes, in addition to the purchase price, the amount of any tariff or duty paid with respect to the importation of the article used. In case the article used is acquired by lease or by gift or is extracted, produced, or manufactured by the person using the same or is sold under conditions wherein the purchase price does not represent the true value thereof, the value of the article used is determined as nearly as possible according to the retail selling price at place of use of similar products of like quality and character under such rules as the department may prescribe.

    b. In case the articles used are acquired by bailment, the value of the use of the articles so used must be in an amount representing a reasonable rental for the use of the articles so bailed, determined as nearly as possible according to the value of such use at the places of use of similar products of like quality and character under such rules as the department of revenue may prescribe. In case any such articles of tangible personal property are used in respect to the construction, repairing, decorating, or improving of, and which become or are to become an ingredient or component of, new or existing buildings or other structures under, upon, or above real property of or for the United States, any instrumentality thereof, or a county or city housing authority created pursuant to chapter 35.82 RCW, including the installing or attaching of any such articles therein or thereto, whether or not such personal property becomes a part of the realty by virtue of installation, then the value of the use of such articles so used is determined according to the retail selling price of such articles, or in the absence of such a selling price, as nearly as possible according to the retail selling price at place of use of similar products of like quality and character or, in the absence of either of these selling price measures, such value may be determined upon a cost basis, in any event under such rules as the department of revenue may prescribe.

    c. In the case of articles owned by a user engaged in business outside the state which are brought into the state for no more than 180 days in any period of 365 consecutive days and which are temporarily used for business purposes by the person in this state, the value of the article used must be an amount representing a reasonable rental for the use of the articles, unless the person has paid tax under this chapter or chapter 82.08 RCW upon the full value of the article used, as defined in (a) of this subsection.

    d. In the case of articles manufactured or produced by the user and used in the manufacture or production of products sold or to be sold to the department of defense of the United States, the value of the articles used is determined according to the value of the ingredients of such articles.

    e. In the case of an article manufactured or produced for purposes of serving as a prototype for the development of a new or improved product, the value of the article used is determined by: (i) The retail selling price of such new or improved product when first offered for sale; or (ii) the value of materials incorporated into the prototype in cases in which the new or improved product is not offered for sale.

    f. In the case of an article purchased with a direct pay permit under RCW 82.32.087, the value of the article used is determined by the purchase price of such article if, but for the use of the direct pay permit, the transaction would have been subject to sales tax.

    g. In the case of asphalt or aggregates manufactured or extracted by a person providing services taxable under RCW 82.04.280(1)(b) and used by that person in providing those services, the value of the asphalt or aggregates is equal to the sum of all direct and indirect costs attributable to the asphalt or aggregates used, plus a public road construction market adjustment of five percent of those costs.

8. "Value of the digital good or digital code used" means the purchase price for the digital good or digital code, the use of which is taxable under this chapter. If the digital good or digital code is acquired other than by purchase, the value of the digital good or digital code must be determined as nearly as possible according to the retail selling price at place of use of similar digital goods or digital codes of like quality and character under rules the department may prescribe.

9. "Value of the extended warranty used" means the purchase price for the extended warranty, the use of which is taxable under this chapter.

    a. The value of a product manufactured or produced for purposes of serving as a prototype for the development of a new or improved product shall correspond: (i) To the retail selling price of such new or improved product when first offered for sale; or (ii) to the value of materials incorporated into the prototype in cases in which the new or improved product is not offered for sale. The department of revenue shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for the purpose of ascertaining such values.
