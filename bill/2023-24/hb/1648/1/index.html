<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A person may not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Use software to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell software that is advertised for profit with the express purpose to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use or sale of software as described in subsection (1) of this section only violates this section if the user or seller knows or should know that the purpose of the software is to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person may not knowingly resell or offer to resell an admission ticket that such person knows was obtained using software to circumvent, thwart, interfere with, or evade a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology, and was not obtained for the person's own use or the use of their invitees, employees, or agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the conduct described in subsection (1) of this section vitally affects the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Using or selling software to circumvent, thwart, or evade a control or measure, which is used on a ticket seller's internet website, application, phone system, or similar technology to ensure an equitable distribution of tickets, is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purposes of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Price disclosures. Ticket sellers and ticket resellers may not sell, offer for sale, resell, or offer for resale an admission ticket, including by means of an internet website, application, phone system or other technology used to sell tickets, without disclosing to a consumer the total amount that the consumer will be charged before the consumer purchases the admission ticket, including any fees which represent a portion of the total amount to be charged.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The following disclosures must be made by ticket sellers and ticket resellers to a user prior to the user selecting a ticket:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The face value price of the admission ticket; and</p>
</li>

<ol type="a" start="2">

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>License revocation. If a person fails to pay a fine under subsection (1) of this section within 30 days of the date on the fine, the department may, after notice to the person and reasonable opportunity for the licensee to be heard, revoke a license or suspend the same for such period as the department may deem proper, upon satisfactory proof that the licensee has violated, or permitted a violation of any provision of this chapter, a condition of the license or any rule or regulation of the department.</p>

<h2 id="section-10">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter preempts all existing or future laws enacted by a county, city, town, or other political subdivision of the state regarding the sale of admission tickets to events.</p>
<h2 id="section-11">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11">¶</a></h2>

<p>This act takes effect January 1, 2024.</p>
<h2 id="section-14">Section 14 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-14">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washingtonians are proud to support the arts and music and entertainment events; value the opportunity to attend live events; and appreciate the economic benefit these events and venues bring to local communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature submits that in multiple instances, consumers have had negative ticket sales experiences, including the most recent Taylor Swift concert tour. These concert fans were frustrated at the &quot;nightmare dressed like a daydream&quot; when trying to get access to their favorite artist's live events. When fans felt the ticket sales industry created &quot;bad blood&quot; with consumers, they refused to be told &quot;you need to calm down.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature believes ticket sellers should be &quot;fearless&quot; in providing integrity, fairness, and transparency with consumers, and therefore, the legislature refuses to &quot;shake it off.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
