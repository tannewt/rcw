    a. The date of sale or transfer;

    b. The owner's full name and complete, current address;

        iii. Immediately update the department's vehicle record when a report of sale has been filed;

        iv. Provide instructions on release of interest forms that allow the seller of a vehicle to release their interest in a vehicle at the same time a financial institution, as defined in RCW 30A.22.040, releases its lien on the vehicle; and

    v. Send a report to the department of revenue that lists vehicles for which a report of sale has been received but no transfer of ownership has taken place. The department shall send the report once each quarter.

    b. A report of sale is not proof of a completed vehicle transfer for purposes of the collection of expenses related to towing, storage, and auction of an abandoned vehicle in situations where there is no evidence indicating the buyer knew of or was a party to acceptance of the vehicle transfer. A contract signed by the prior owner and the new owner, a certificate of title, a receipt, a purchase order or wholesale order, or other legal proof or record of acceptance of the vehicle by the new owner may be provided to establish legal responsibility for the abandoned vehicle.

5. Report of sale â€“ licensed dealers. A vehicle dealer as defined in RCW 46.70.011 may, but is not required to, file a report of sale on behalf of an owner who trades in, sells, or otherwise transfers ownership of a vehicle to the dealer. A vehicle dealer who files on behalf of an owner may collect and remit the fees required under RCW 46.17.050 from the owner in addition to any other fees charged to or owed by the customer.

    a.  A person who has recently acquired a vehicle by purchase, exchange, gift, lease, inheritance, or legal action shall apply to the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director for a new certificate of title within 15 days of delivery of the vehicle. A secured party who has possession of the certificate of title shall either:

        i. Apply for a new certificate of title on behalf of the owner and pay the fee required under RCW 46.17.100; or

        ii. Provide all required documents to the owner, as long as the transfer was not a breach of its security agreement, to allow the owner to apply for a new certificate of title.

    b. Compliance with this subsection does not affect the rights of the secured party.

7. The certificate of title must be kept by or delivered to the person who becomes the secured party when a security interest is reserved or created at the time of the transfer of ownership. The parties must comply with RCW 46.12.675.

It is a misdemeanor to fail or neglect to apply for a transfer of ownership within 45 days after delivery of the vehicle. The misdemeanor is a single continuing offense for each day that passes regardless of the number of days that have elapsed following the 45 day time period.

9. The penalty is not charged if the delay in application is due to at least one of the following:
