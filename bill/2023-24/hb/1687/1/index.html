<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state's vehicle and vessel licensing system depends on a partnership between the department of licensing, the county auditors, and the vehicle subagents. Vehicle subagents perform vehicle and vessel licensing on behalf of the state; they are small Washington family businesses, not large out-of-state corporations, and therefore the revenue from these businesses stays in Washington state and is invested back into their Washington communities. Vehicle subagents are located in most communities of the state and are open extended hours and weekends to serve the public. These private businesses collect and remit hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and fees for the state of Washington each year. The only moneys that are retained by vehicle subagents are the registration service fee or the titling service fee; all other moneys are remitted to the county and state. With the rising costs of property rents, worker benefits, and employee wages, and future increases to come, vehicle subagents rely on steady and dependable revenue commensurate with inflation of these business costs to operate successfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to keep the state vehicle and vessel licensing delivery system healthy, and vehicle subagents and county auditors are a critical component of that system. The service fee retained by vehicle subagents and the filing fee deposited into county general funds are set in statute and must be changed by the legislature. Historically, these fees were adjusted every four to five years. It is the intent of the legislature to make fee adjustments to keep the vehicle subagents and county auditors healthy by implementing a cost-of-living adjustment every three years, which will allow vehicle subagents to receive the important fee adjustments required at regular intervals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>

<p>$15 for changes in a certificate of title, changes in ownership for nontitled vehicles, or for verification of record and preparation of an affidavit of lost title other than at the time of the certificate of title application or transfer, in addition to any other fees or taxes due at the time of application; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$8 for a registration renewal, issuing a transit permit, or any other service under this section, in addition to any other fees or taxes due at the time of application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>During the first quarter of the year preceding the scheduled inflationary adjustment, the department shall reach out and gather stakeholder comment on the anticipated adjustment.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
