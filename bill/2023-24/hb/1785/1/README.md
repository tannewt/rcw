## Section 1
The legislature finds that it is an important and essential protection for workers who contracted COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic, to be fully protected and covered under our workers' compensation system. The legislature intends to give consistent presumptive protections to all workers who contracted COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic when proximately caused by exposures at work, as expressed by the legislature in RCW 51.32.181 as established in Laws of 2021, chapter 252, section 1. The legislature further intends to ensure workers' compensation protections to any worker who has shown that workplace exposure was a proximate cause of contracting COVID-19, and to impose no further requirements on any worker to impair the worker's eligibility for benefits and coverage. It is the intent of the legislature that the board of industrial insurance appeals decision In re Christopher J. Sutherland, docket number: 21 15953 (August 8, 2022) be overturned.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. For all workers covered under this title, any infectious or contagious diseases that are transmitted through respiratory droplets or aerosols, or through contact with contaminated surfaces and are the subject of a public health emergency, and which are shown to be proximately caused by employment or work conditions, whether through the presumption set out in this section or otherwise, are occupational diseases under RCW 51.08.140.

    b. Beginning on the effective date of this section, a worker or the survivor of a worker who has died as a result of any infectious or contagious disease that is transmitted through respiratory droplets or aerosols, or through contact with contaminated surfaces and is the subject of a public health emergency, and whose claim was denied by order of the department, the board of industrial insurance appeals, or a court, may file a new claim for the same exposure and contended condition or disease, if the denial was made before the effective date of this section.

2. For frontline employees who are covered under this title, there exists a prima facie presumption that any infectious or contagious diseases that are transmitted through respiratory droplets or aerosols, or through contact with contaminated surfaces and are the subject of a public health emergency are occupational diseases under RCW 51.08.140 during a public health emergency.

3. The frontline employee must provide verification, as required by the department by rule, to the department and the self-insured employer that the employee has contracted the infectious or contagious disease that is the subject of the public health emergency.

4. This presumption of occupational disease may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that:

    a. The exposure to the infectious or contagious disease which is the subject of the public health emergency occurred from other employment or nonemployment activities; or

    b. The employee was working from the employee's home, on leave from the employee's employment, or some combination thereof, for the period of quarantine consistent with recommended guidance from state and federal health officials for the disease immediately prior to the employee's injury, occupational disease, or period of incapacity that resulted from exposure to the disease which is the subject of the public health emergency.

5. [Empty]

    a. RCW 51.32.090(7) does not apply to an occupational disease under this section except that no worker shall receive compensation for or during the day on which the occupational disease was contracted. For the purposes of this subsection (5), the day on which the occupational disease was contracted is whichever date occurs first of the following:

        i. The date that the worker first missed work due to symptoms of the infectious or contagious disease;

        ii. The date the worker was quarantined by a medical provider or public health official; or

        iii. The date the worker received a positive test result confirming contraction of the infectious or contagious disease.

    b. If leave or similar benefits are paid to the frontline employee as part of a federal or state program for these employees during the public health emergency, temporary total disability benefits are not payable for the same period of time covered by the federal or state program.

6. When calculating assessments due to the department for which total claim costs are the basis, self-insured employers and self-insurance hospital groups formed under RCW 51.14.150 and 51.14.160 may deduct the cost of payments made under this section from the total of all claim costs reported.

7. Costs of the payments under this section shall not affect the experience rating of employers insured by the state fund.
