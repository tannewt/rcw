<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the multidisciplinary team approach coordinated by children's advocacy centers improves interagency communication, increases the effectiveness of the investigation and prosecution of child abuse, and results in fewer interviews with and less trauma for the child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that current language defining children's advocacy centers was written more than 20 years ago, when such centers were just beginning to develop in our state. Additionally, current language defining child forensic interviews was also written at a time when there were few, if any, designated specialized child forensic interviewers in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children's exposure to violence in Washington state is occurring at an alarming rate and is a traumatic, adverse experience that can have severe and long-lasting consequences. This traumatic disruption of healthy development is a significant public health crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children exposed to violence can heal if given access to specialized resources, evidence-based treatment, and proper support that promotes the well‐being of them and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because research shows positive outcomes when trauma or adverse experiences are addressed early, the legislature finds that a task force to examine and recommend best practices for effective trauma-informed programs for children who are witnesses or exposed to violence would yield positive results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, because the legislature finds children's advocacy centers employ trauma-informed, research-based, best practices that help child victims of abuse and children exposed to violence heal and reduce the risk of future abuse and other negative consequences, the legislature finds it necessary to update definitions and guidance to ensure support for children's advocacy centers by more accurately defining the work they do, and the tools necessary to support their work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Statewide and regional peer review of child forensic interviews serve as quality assurance mechanisms that reinforce the methodologies utilized in child forensic interviewing and provide support and problem solving for participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child forensic interview recordings of closed cases may be used as part of a structured and confidential peer review, if hosted by an accredited or developing children's advocacy center or the children's advocacy centers of Washington. Any information reviewed or discussed during the peer review process is and must remain confidential and must not be disclosed except where authorized under state or federal law. The hosting organization's policies regarding interview selection criteria and parent, guardian, or caregiver consent must be followed. All participants in a peer review must sign a confidentiality agreement that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Prohibits verbal or written disclosure of any information received in any peer review process; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires disclosure of any personal, professional, or social acquaintance with anyone associated with the case before attending a peer review session.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
