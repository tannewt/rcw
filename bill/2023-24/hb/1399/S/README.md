# HB 1399 - Native American scholarships

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1399-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that Native American people have faced historical traumas that have had a lasting impact in many facets of life, including educational attainment. Historically, education was used as a reformation tactic to strip away Native identity and culture to whitewash the indigenous population and destroy a nations own first people by separating Native children from their families. The legislature acknowledges the historical use of education as a weapon and the opportunity to partner with federally recognized Indian tribes to establish truth and reconciliation regarding boarding school traumas in order to facilitate change and remove stigmas of how Native Americans view education.

The legislature also recognizes that Native Americans are one of the most underrepresented populations in Washington's universities and colleges, and that this group has some of the lowest year-to-year retention and degree attainment compared to other population groups. Native Americans face additional challenges in attaining higher education, such as high rates of poverty and lack of postsecondary educational access near reservations. A national study on college affordability for indigenous students found that 16 percent of participants experienced homelessness during higher education, more than a quarter experienced food insecurity, and 43 percent had a household income less than $20,000.

Therefore, the legislature identifies the need to recognize historical truths and traumas and to reconcile these by reinvesting in Native American survivors. One way to do this is to remove financial barriers to postsecondary education for Native Americans. The legislature embraces the opportunity to rectify wrongs by investing in scholarships for members of federally recognized Indian tribes that go beyond tuition expenses to recognize the total cost of attendance. When the state invests in an educated Native workforce, Native communities become more economically resilient, stronger, healthier, and empowered. Robust Native communities help make a more resilient and vigorous Washington state and contribute to alleviating workforce demand by tapping into historically underutilized talent. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish the Native American scholarship program with the recognition that indigenous populations need additional assistance to pursue postsecondary education because of historical actions that have left lasting impacts.

This scholarship is offered to fulfill additional cost of attendance needs that are not covered through other state financial aid programs. To be eligible for state and federal financial aid, students must complete a financial aid application such as the free application for federal student aid or the Washington application for state financial aid. These financial aid applications enable institutions to determine eligibility for financial aid through income, residence, and other relevant information. Washington's free application for federal student aid completion ranking has consistently been in the bottom five in the nation. Offering a scholarship to members of federally recognized Indian tribes creates an additional incentive for members to complete financial aid applications, thereby increasing opportunities for other financial aid programs and providing students with additional funds to attend postsecondary education.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Eligible student" means a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe located within the United States who files a financial aid application approved by the office and enrolls in: (a) An undergraduate degree program at an institution of higher education; or (b) a registered apprenticeship program.

2. "Gift aid" has the same definition as in RCW 28B.145.010.

3. "Institution of higher education" includes the state universities, the regional universities, the state college, and the community and technical colleges as defined in RCW 28B.10.016.

Additional funding may be used to provide a scholarship to cover required supplies, tools, materials, work clothing, and living expenses.

    c. The office may also prioritize funding that secures an eligible student's scholarship for the entire length of the student's program.

3. Eligible students may receive the scholarship for a maximum of 150 percent of their time to degree or six years, whichever occurs first.

Expenditures from the account may be used only for the Native American scholarship program. Only the director of the office or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.
