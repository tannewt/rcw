# HB 1743 - Employee ownership

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1743.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

Employee ownership in companies provides numerous benefits to both businesses and workers across all industries. Research from the national center for employee ownership found that one such structure, employee stock ownership plans, had better workforce retention, benefits and retirement security, and firm performance than nonemployee stock ownership plans companies in the same industry. In addition, the Rutgers school of management and labor relations found that employee-owned companies outperformed nonemployee-owned companies in job retention, pay, and workplace health safety throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. At their core, employee ownership structures allow employees to gain ownership stake in a business, increasing their personal wealth without the risks related to starting or purchasing their own company.

States throughout the nation have moved to provide support for employee ownership structures. The Colorado employee ownership office has operated since 2019 to create a network of technical support and service providers considering employee ownership structures. Recently, both California and Massachusetts passed legislation to establish their own dedicated employee ownership support programs. Other states, such as Iowa, provide tax benefits and upfront costs to businesses interested in employee ownership.

Further, the federal government has recognized the benefit broad-based employee ownership structures provide to communities. The American rescue plan act included $10,000,000,000 for the state small business credit initiative. Through that act congress also directed the treasury department to allow state small business credit initiative funding to be used for transitions to employee ownership, when state small business credit initiative funding has not been historically available for business transactions.

The legislature desires to provide a dedicated program to educate businesses on employee ownership, assist both owners and workers in navigating available resources, reduce barriers to transitioning to employee-owned structures, and provide tax support for businesses that transition to an employee ownership structure.

Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to encourage the growth of employee ownership structures through this expanding employee ownership act.

## Section 2
