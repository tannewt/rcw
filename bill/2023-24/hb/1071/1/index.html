<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this act is to provide a school resource officer in every school to promote a safe learning environment and to protect the safety and welfare of all students and school personnel. The legislature finds that recent acts of mass violence across the nation have threatened the safety of children at school. Thus, the legislature intends to implement short and long-term strategies that empower school districts to protect our students and provide a safe and secure learning environment. The legislature further intends to enact laws that support our schools and enable them to increase security, provide greater protections for students and staff, and develop local strategies to identify and intervene against potential threats. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide every public school in Washington with the resources to employ a full-time school resource officer to promote a safe learning environment and to protect the safety and welfare of all students and school personnel.</p>

<p>A school that is the subject of a state-tribal education compact must report student enrollment.
