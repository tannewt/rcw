<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that sexual assault is a devastating crime affecting thousands of Washingtonians. For this reason, the state has engaged in a multiyear effort to implement victim-centered and trauma-informed practices for responding to sexual assault across the criminal legal system. With the support of state funding and the sexual assault kit initiative, the Washington state crime laboratory has conducted the testing of over 10,000 previously unsubmitted sexual assault kits, and has expanded testing capacity to ensure all sexual assault kits will be tested within 45 days of submission going forward. Yet testing alone is not enough.</p>
<p>Each report of sexual assault should be investigated at the local level, regardless of the status of any sexual assault kit. All sexual assault survivors deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and that begins with investigating every report of sexual assault. Further, thorough and professional investigations are imperative for public safety. Recent research demonstrates that the majority of perpetrators commit multiple assaults over their lifetime. Despite this, perpetrators often evade accountability and prosecution. This needs to change. By improving forensic testing, conducting thorough investigations of each report, and implementing best practices for all practitioners, the state can successfully bring perpetrators to justice and prevent further victimization. Therefore, the legislature intends to expand efforts to improve investigations and prosecutions by requiring timely investigations of sexual assault cases with CODIS hits, and requiring regular reporting on the status of those cases. Access to these reports will provide policymakers and practitioners with critical insights as implementation continues with broader reform efforts.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>When a law enforcement agency receives a sexual assault kit, the law enforcement agency must, within thirty days of its receipt, submit a request for laboratory examination to the Washington state patrol crime laboratory for prioritization for testing by it or another accredited laboratory that holds an outsourcing agreement with the Washington state patrol if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The law enforcement agency has received a related report or complaint alleging a sexual assault or other crime has occurred; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Consent for laboratory examination has been given by the victim; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The victim is a person under the age of eighteen who is not emancipated pursuant to chapter 13.64 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning May 1, 2022, when the Washington state patrol receives a request for laboratory examination of a sexual assault kit from a law enforcement agency, the Washington state patrol shall conduct the laboratory examination of the sexual assault kit, and when appropriate, enter relevant information into the combined DNA index system, within forty-five days of receipt of the request. The Washington state patrol crime laboratory must give priority to the laboratory examination of sexual assault kits at the request of a local law enforcement agency for:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Active investigations and cases with impending court dates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active investigations where public safety is an immediate concern;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violent crimes investigations, including active sexual assault investigations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Postconviction cases; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other crimes' investigations and nonactive investigations, such as previously unsubmitted older sexual assault kits or recently collected sexual assault kits that the submitting agency has determined to be lower priority based on their initial investigation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirements to request and complete laboratory examination of sexual assault kits under subsections (1) and (2) of this section do not include forensic toxicological analysis. However, nothing in this section limits or modifies the authority of a law enforcement agency to request toxicological analysis of evidence collected in a sexual assault kit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When forensic analysis of a sexual assault kit submitted under this section generates a profile resulting in a hit in the combined DNA index system, the applicable general law enforcement agency shall conduct a criminal investigation of any report connected to the sexual assault kit within 90 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure of a law enforcement agency  or the  Washington state patrol to complete the requirements under this section within the time periods prescribed under this section does not constitute grounds in any criminal proceeding for challenging the validity of a DNA evidence association, and any evidence obtained from the sexual assault kit may not be excluded by a court on those grounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person accused or convicted of committing a crime against a victim has no standing to object to any failure to comply with the requirements of this section, and the failure to comply with the requirements of this section is not grounds for setting aside the conviction or sentence.</p>

The Washington state patrol shall process the forensic analysis of sexual assault kits in accordance with the priorities in RCW 5.70.040(2).</p>
