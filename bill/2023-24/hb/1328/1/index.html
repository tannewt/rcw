<p><a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1328.pdf">Source</a></p>
<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that, in accordance with the federal every student succeeds act, the state in 2015 set a target of 90 percent of students meeting grade level math and English language arts standards by 2025. Despite this goal, the percentage of Washington students performing at grade level has never exceeded 50 percent for math or 60 percent for English language arts.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the prolonged school shutdowns in 2020 exacerbated the situation, with the most recent test scores showing that only 51 percent of Washington students are meeting English language arts standards and just 38 percent are meeting math standards. The legislature finds that this compounding impact of the pandemic on student learning was significant and inequitable, widening preexisting opportunity and achievement gaps and hitting historically disadvantaged students hardest.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide additional state funding support for students who are not meeting academic standards. First, the legislature intends to fund supplemental programs of assistance, beyond the state's statutory program of basic education, for school districts, charter schools, and state-tribal education compact schools to provide additional academic supports for students not meeting standards. If school districts fail to increase the percentage of students performing at grade level, the legislature intends to provide a new family stipend to parents of struggling students, so that parents have additional resources to arrange directly for tutoring or other academic supports for their children.</p>

<p>Beginning September 1, 2023, and each school year thereafter, the superintendent of public instruction must allocate $250 per full-time equivalent student to each local education agency, increased for inflation from the 2023-24 school year, to establish supplemental supports for students who are not meeting academic standards.
