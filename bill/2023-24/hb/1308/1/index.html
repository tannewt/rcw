<ol>
<li>
<p>In 2019 the legislature created a system of multiple graduation pathway options, which took effect beginning with the class of 2020. The legislature intended for the graduation pathways to be student-focused, adaptable, rigorous, and meaningful ways for students to demonstrate appropriate readiness in support of their individualized career and college goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature anticipated that school districts might face barriers to implementing the pathways and students might face barriers to accessing the pathway options. The legislature charged the state board of education with research on the first three years of implementation to identify barriers and provide recommendations for changes to the existing pathways and additional pathway options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While implementation of the graduation pathway options was significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the research on early implementation identified access and equity barriers that would exist even without the pandemic. The research shows that the initial set of graduation pathway options do not meet the needs of all students. The research found some students completing pathways that do not align with their individual goals for after high school, in which case the pathway is not serving its intended purpose. Overall, students, families, and educators report a need for additional relevant and authentic options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that students can demonstrate readiness in multiple ways and recognizes the need to expand graduation pathways in order to provide options that are student-focused, individualized, relevant, and that support all student needs. Research shows that performance-based assessments are valid ways of measuring students' readiness for success in college and careers. Further, research shows that performance-based assessments are associated with increased student engagement, skill development, critical thinking, and postsecondary success. The legislature recognizes that a performance-based graduation pathway option supports the state's transition to mastery-based learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to create graduation pathway options that allow students to demonstrate their readiness in performance-based ways, in addition to the existing test-based and course-based options, and in core subject areas that most strongly align with the student's individualized goals for high school and beyond. Further, the legislature intends to create ongoing requirements to monitor the graduation pathway options implementation at both the state and local levels to ensure accountability and equitable offerings. In providing a wider variety of graduation pathway options, the state maintains its commitment to high standards for earning a meaningful high school diploma that prepares students for success in postsecondary education, gainful employment, civic engagement, and lifelong learning.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning with the class of 2020, except as provided in RCW 28A.230.320, graduation from a public high school and the earning of a high school diploma must include the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Satisfying the graduation requirements established by the state board of education under RCW 28A.230.090 and any graduation requirements established by the applicable public high school or school district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfying credit requirements for graduation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrating career and college readiness through completion of the high school and beyond plan as required by RCW 28A.230.090; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting the requirements of at least one graduation pathway option established in this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successful completion of the components in (a) of this subsection together signals a student's readiness to graduate with a meaningful high school diploma that fulfills the diploma purpose established in RCW 28A.230.090.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pathway options established in this section are intended to provide a student with multiple ways, including test-based, course-based, and performance-based options, to demonstrate readiness in furtherance of the student's individual goals for high school and beyond. For the purposes of this section, &quot;demonstrate readiness&quot; means the student is able to apply state learning standards in: (a) English language arts and mathematics; or (b) two or more core subject areas that most directly align with the student's high school and beyond plan goals under RCW 28A.230.090. A student may choose to pursue one or more of the pathway options under subsection (3) of this section, but any pathway option used by a student to demonstrate career and college readiness must be in alignment with the student's high school and beyond plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following graduation pathway options may be used to demonstrate career and college readiness in accordance with subsection (1)(a)(iv) of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Meet or exceed the graduation standard established by the state board of education under RCW 28A.305.130 on the statewide high school assessments in English language arts and mathematics as provided for under RCW 28A.655.070;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete and qualify for college credit in dual credit courses in English language arts and mathematics. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;dual credit course&quot; means a course in which a student qualifies for college and high school credit in English language arts or mathematics upon successfully completing the course;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earn high school credit in a high school transition course in English language arts and mathematics, an example of which includes a bridge to college course. For the purposes of this subsection (3)(c), &quot;high school transition course&quot; means an English language arts or mathematics course offered in high school where successful completion by a high school student ensures the student college-level placement at participating institutions of higher education as defined in RCW 28B.10.016. High school transition courses must satisfy core or elective credit graduation requirements established by the state board of education. A student's successful completion of a high school transition course does not entitle the student to be admitted to an institution of higher education as defined in RCW 28B.10.016;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earn high school credit, with a C+ gradeor higher in AP, international baccalaureate, or Cambridge international courses in English language arts and mathematics; or earn at least the minimum scores outlined in RCW 28B.10.054(1) on the corresponding exams. The state board of education shall establish by rule the list of AP, international baccalaureate, and Cambridge international courses of which successful completion meets the standard in this subsection for English language arts and for mathematics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet or exceed the scores established by the state board of education for the mathematics portion and the reading, English, or writing portion of the SAT or ACT;</p>

</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>While the legislature encourages school districts to make all pathway options established in this section available to their high school students, and to expand their pathway options until that goal is met, school districts have discretion in determining which pathway options under this section they will offer to students.</li>
</ol>
<p>School districts, however, must annually provide students in grades eight through 12 and their parents or legal guardians with comprehensive information about the graduation pathway options offered by the school district and are strongly encouraged to begin providing this information beginning in sixth grade. School districts must provide this information in a manner that conforms with the school district's language access policy and procedures as required under RCW 28A.183.040.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The state board of education shall adopt rules to implement the graduation pathway options established in this section.</li>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The superintendent of public instruction shall collect the following information from school districts: Which of the graduation pathways under RCW 28A.655.250 are available to students at each of the school districts; and the number of students using each graduation pathway for graduation purposes. This information shall be reported annually to the education committees of the legislature beginning January 10, 2021. To the extent feasible, data on student participation in each of the graduation pathways shall be disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and receipt of free or reduced-price lunch.</li>
