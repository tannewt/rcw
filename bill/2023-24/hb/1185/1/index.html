<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that in 2025 the state's stewardship program for the end-of-life management of mercury-containing lights is statutorily scheduled to undergo review, termination, and possible extension under chapter 43.131 RCW, the sunset act. If the mercury-containing lights product stewardship program were allowed to sunset as scheduled, Washington residents would lack a consistent, convenient, and safe way to return unwanted mercury-containing lights, which will remain in use for years, even as the lighting industry has moved away from mercury-containing lights. Mercury-containing lights present such a significant health risk that other states have recently restricted their sale, which represents a solution to reduce the public health impacts of new lighting products, but which does not address the end-of-life management issues associated with the existing light bulbs currently in use. Lights other than mercury-containing lights also contain valuable and recyclable components whose end-of-life management would improve as a result of their inclusion in the existing stewardship program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state's existing mercury-containing lights program, which was first enacted over a decade ago, contains policy provisions, including the establishment of a per-bulb fee attached to the sale of mercury-containing lights, that are now recognized as not representing the best practices for the design of stewardship programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Restrict the sale of some mercury-containing lights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include other types of lights in the state's stewardship program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modernize key elements of the state's stewardship program for lighting products.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Effective January 1, 2026, a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer may not knowingly sell at retail a light, as defined in RCW 70A.505.020 if the light contains mercury .</li>
</ol>

<p>The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to:</p>
<pre><code>a. A special purpose mercury-containing light, as defined in RCW 70A.505.020;

b. The products specified in RCW 70A.230.110; or

c. The sale or purchase of mercury-containing lights as a casual or isolated sale as defined in RCW 82.04.040.

<li>
<p>A violation of this section is punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation in the case of a first violation. Repeat violators are liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each repeat violation. Penalties collected under this section must be deposited in the model toxics control operating account created in RCW 70A.305.180. Penalties imposed under this section are appealable to the pollution control hearings board established in chapter 43.21B RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to mercury-containing lights other than special purpose mercury-containing lights.

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mercury is an essential component of many energy efficient lights. Improper disposal methods will lead to mercury releases that threaten the environment and harm human health. Spent mercury lighting is a hard to collect waste product that is appropriate for product stewardship;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convenient and environmentally sound product stewardship programs for  lights that include collecting, transporting, and recycling mercury-containing lights will help protect Washington's environment and the health of state residents;</p>

<p>The purpose of chapter 130, Laws of 2010 is to achieve a statewide goal of recycling all end-of-life mercury-containing lights by 2020 through expanded public education, a uniform statewide requirement to recycle all mercury-containing lights, and the development of a comprehensive, safe, and convenient collection system that includes use of residential curbside collection programs, mail-back containers, increased support for household hazardous waste facilities, and a network of additional collection locations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this act is to reduce exposure to mercury by phasing out the sale of most mercury-containing lights, and by transitioning the stewardship program established under this chapter to one that is focused on the improved end-of-life management of all types of lights;</p>
