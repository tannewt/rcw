# HB 1185 - Lighting products

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1185-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that in 2025 the state's stewardship program for the end-of-life management of mercury-containing lights is statutorily scheduled to undergo review and termination or possible extension under chapter 43.131 RCW, the sunset act. If the mercury-containing lights product stewardship program were allowed to sunset as scheduled, Washington residents would lack a consistent, convenient, and safe way to return unwanted mercury-containing lights, which will remain in use for years, even as the lighting industry has moved away from mercury-containing lights. Mercury-containing lights present such a significant health risk that other states have recently restricted their sale, which represents a solution to reduce the public health impacts of new lighting products, but which does not address the end-of-life management issues associated with the existing light bulbs currently in use. Lights other than mercury-containing lights also contain valuable and recyclable components whose end-of-life management would improve as a result of their inclusion in the existing stewardship program.

2. The state's existing mercury-containing lights program, which was first enacted over a decade ago, contains policy provisions, including the establishment of a per-bulb fee attached to the sale of mercury-containing lights, that are now recognized as not representing the best practices for the design of stewardship programs.

3. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to:

    a. Restrict the sale of some mercury-containing lights;

    b. Include other types of lights in the state's stewardship program; and

    c. Modernize key elements of the state's stewardship program for lighting products.

## Section 2
1. Effective January 1, 2026, a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer may not knowingly sella compact fluorescent lamp or linear fluorescent lamp, as defined in RCW 70A.505.020 if the  lamp contains mercury .

2.

The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply to:

    a. A special purpose mercury-containing light, as defined in RCW 70A.505.020;

    b. The products specified in RCW 70A.230.110; or

    c. The sale or purchase of mercury-containing lights as a casual or isolated sale as defined in RCW 82.04.040.

3. A violation of this section is punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation in the case of a first violation. Repeat violators are liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each repeat violation. Penalties collected under this section must be deposited in the model toxics control operating account created in RCW 70A.305.180. Penalties imposed under this section are appealable to the pollution control hearings board established in chapter 43.21B RCW.

4. The department may adopt rules to implement, administer, and enforce the requirements of this section.

## Section 3
1. As of January 1, 2026, no producer, wholesaler, retailer, electric utility, or other person may distribute, sell, or offer for sale lights to any person in this state unless the producer is participating in a product stewardship program under a plan approved by the department.

2. Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to mercury-containing lights other than special purpose mercury-containing lights. Mercury-containing lights other than special purpose mercury-containing lights are subject to the provisions of RCW 70A.505.090 until December 31, 2025, after which they are instead subject to the provisions of RCW 70A.230.020 beginning January 1, 2026.

## Section 4
The legislature finds that:

1. Mercury is an essential component of many energy efficient lights. Improper disposal methods will lead to mercury releases that threaten the environment and harm human health. Spent mercury lighting is a hard to collect waste product that is appropriate for product stewardship;

2. Convenient and environmentally sound product stewardship programs for  lights that include collecting, transporting, and recycling mercury-containing lights will help protect Washington's environment and the health of state residents;

3. [Empty]

    a. The purpose of chapter 130, Laws of 2010 is to achieve a statewide goal of recycling all end-of-life mercury-containing lights by 2020 through expanded public education, a uniform statewide requirement to recycle all mercury-containing lights, and the development of a comprehensive, safe, and convenient collection system that includes use of residential curbside collection programs, mail-back containers, increased support for household hazardous waste facilities, and a network of additional collection locations;

    b. The purpose of this act is to reduce exposure to mercury by phasing out the sale of most mercury-containing lights, and by transitioning the stewardship program established under this chapter to one that is focused on the improved end-of-life management of all types of lights;

4. Product producers must play a significant role in financing no-cost collection and processing programs for  lights; and

5. Providers of premium collection services such as residential curbside and mail-back programs may charge a fee to cover the collection costs for these more convenient forms of collection.

Every producer of  lights sold, made available for sale, or distributed in or into Washington state for use in Washington state must participate in a product stewardship program for those products, operated by a stewardship organization and financed in the manner provided by RCW 70A.505.050. Every such producer must inform the department of the producer's participation in a product stewardship program by including the producer's name in a plan submitted to the department by a stewardship organization as required by RCW 70A.505.040. Producers must satisfy these participation obligations individually or may do so jointly with other producers.

    b. A stewardship organization implementing an approved program under this chapter may continue to implement the approved program in the form and manner described in its plan until December 31, 2025. The provisions of this act apply to programs that a stewardship organization must implement beginning January 1, 2026, and to the rule adoption, fee payment, plan submission, and plan approval processes that predate the implementation of the new program to begin January 1, 2026.

2. Until January 1, 2026, a stewardship organization operating a product stewardship program must pay all administrative and operational costs associated with its program with revenues received from the environmental handling charge imposed under the plan approved by the department prior to the effective date of this section. Beginning January 1, 2026, a stewardship organization operating a product stewardship program must pay all administrative and operational costs associated with its program with revenues received from participating producers.

The department may update the definitions of "urban area" used for purposes of this chapter to align with changes made by the United States census bureau.

    c. For the portion of the population that does not have a permanent collection location within a 15-mile radius, the program must provide residents a reasonable opportunity to drop off unwanted lights at collection events. The stewardship organization, in consultation with the department and the local community, must determine a reasonable frequency and location of these collection events, to be held in underserved areas.

5. Product stewardship programs shall promote the safe handling and recycling of  lights to the public, including producing and offering point-of-sale educational materials to retailers of  lights and point-of-return educational materials to collection locations.

6. All product stewardship programs operated under approved plans must recover their fair share of unwanted covered products as determined by the department.

7. The department or its designee may inspect, audit, or review audits of processing and disposal facilities used to fulfill the requirements of a product stewardship program.

    vii. And distribution of consumer-focused educational promotional materials to each collection location used by the program and accessible by customers of retailers that sell lights;

    viii. And distribution of safety information related to light collection activities to the operator of each collection site; and
