# HB 1513 - Traffic safety

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1513-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds the following:

    a. The state of Washington and its political subdivisions undertake to protect the safety of all individuals who use public roadways, including people who drive, bike, walk, and roll;

    b. Focusing enforcement resources on high-risk behavior such as impaired driving, distracted driving, unrestrained passengers, and speeding, has been shown to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities;

    c. Research shows that prioritizing safety stops reduces traffic crash and injury outcomes and reduces racial disparities in traffic stops;

    d. Limited law enforcement resources are most effective when focused on highest risk behavior, and enforcement only through citations, fines, and fees is not proven to improve road safety and further entangles many low-income road users in the criminal and debt collection systems, causing financial hardship and harming their ability to drive to work and contribute to the economic vitality of the state;

    e. National and local data show that high discretion, low-risk traffic violations, including those that are unrelated to road safety, fall disproportionately on black, brown, and indigenous road users, as well as low-income road users and people with older vehicles; and

    f. Biased traffic stops result in a decreased sense of safety for all road users and law enforcement.

2. As a result of these findings, the legislature has a compelling interest in managing public safety resources to address vehicle violations that impact road safety, and to reduce punitive enforcement of high-discretion traffic violations, so that road safety is improved for all road users.

## Section 2
Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, a grant program is established. The department of commerce shall develop and implement a grant program to support local initiatives that provide solution-oriented responses to nonmoving violations for low-income road users. The department of commerce must prioritize the award of grants to local initiatives that expand or establish civilian intervention programs for nonmoving violations, and focus on nonpunitive interventions such as helmet voucher programs, fee offset programs, fix-it tickets, and repair vouchers that provide solutions for vehicle equipment failures for low-income road users.

1. Grants must be awarded to local jurisdictions based on locally developed proposals to establish or expand existing programs, including programs with community-lead organizations. Eligible jurisdictions under the grant program include cities, counties, tribal government entities, tribal organizations, law enforcement agencies, or nonprofit organizations.

2. The department of commerce shall report on its website by December 1st of each year on the recipients, locations, and types of projects funded under this program.

3. Beginning September 1, 2024, and biennially thereafter, the department of commerce shall provide a report to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature detailing findings on the effectiveness of programs funded under this section and any recommendations for enhancements or modifications to the grant program established under this section.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a peace officer may not stop, or otherwise detain, an operator of a vehicle to enforce one or more of the following violations as a primary offense:

        i. Any nonmoving violation, except violations of RCW 46.37.190, or where a vehicle does not have any license plates, or where the license plate does not match the registered make, model, year, and color of the vehicle;

        ii. Driving while license suspended or revoked in the third degree under RCW 46.20.342(1)(c) (ii), (iv), (v), or (viii); or

        iii. Any warrant for a misdemeanor, other than a misdemeanor warrant for driving under the influence under RCW 46.61.502 or a domestic violence violation, or a civil court order.

    b. [Empty]

        i. A peace officer may only stop or detain an operator of a vehicle when the primary reason for the stop is an equipment failure violation when necessary to protect against an immediate, serious threat to the safety of the operator or others on the roadway.

        ii. Prior to first contact with the operator of the vehicle under this subsection (1)(b), the peace officer must log digitally or notify dispatch of the primary reason for the stop, including a detailed description of the immediate, serious threat to the safety of the operator or others on the roadway.

        iii. Upon first contact with the operator of the vehicle during a stop under this subsection (1)(b), the peace officer must inform the operator of the reason for the stop, and may not request a consent search of the operator, any passengers, or the vehicle. The peace officer may not question the operator or any passenger of the vehicle on a subject other than the equipment violation that initiated the stop, unless the peace officer detects evidence that establishes reasonable suspicion sufficient to question the operator about an independent criminal offense.

    c. Enforcement of nonmoving violations may be accomplished as a secondary action when a driver of a motor vehicle has been stopped or detained for a suspected violation of a separate moving violation.

2. [Empty]

    a. Prior to first contact with the operator of a vehicle for a moving violation, a peace officer must log digitally or notify dispatch of the primary reason for the stop.

    b. Upon first contact with the operator of the vehicle, the peace officer must inform the operator of the reason for the stop.

    c. For moving violations that are infractions or simple misdemeanors, the peace officer may not request a consent search of the operator of the vehicle, any passengers, or the vehicle. The peace officer may not question the operator of the vehicle or any passenger on a subject other than the moving violation that initiated the stop, unless the peace officer detects evidence that establishes reasonable suspicion sufficient to question the operator about an independent criminal offense.

3. Before engaging in any consent search of a vehicle, the operator, or any passengers that is not prohibited under subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the peace officer must obtain written consent. To obtain consent, the peace officer must provide the operator and any passengers with an oral explanation and a written consent form that explains the purpose of the search, that the search is voluntary, that such persons may ask to speak with an attorney, and that such persons may choose not to consent to the search or decline the search at any point. The form must state explicitly that such persons will not be punished or suffer retaliation for not consenting or declining to be searched. The form must be available at least in English and Spanish and explained orally to a person who is unable to read the form, using, when necessary, an interpreter from the district communications center language line or other agency resources.

4. Any evidence recovered during a stop, detention, or search made in violation of this section is inadmissible in any criminal proceeding.

5. For purposes of this section:

    a. "Immediate, serious threat to the safety of the operator or others on the roadway" means that, based on the totality of the circumstances, it is reasonable for an objective observer to believe that an equipment failure on the vehicle may cause immediate, serious injury to the operator or other persons in the vicinity of the vehicle. Depending on the circumstances, such an immediate threat may include, but is not limited to: Having both taillights, headlights, or brake lights out at nighttime; a shattered windshield impairing the operator's ability to see; or a dragging muffler.

    b. "Moving violation" is defined by rule pursuant to RCW 46.20.2891.

    c. "Nonmoving violation" means any parking violation, equipment violation, or paperwork violation relating to insurance, registration, licensing, and inspection.

    d. "Peace officer" has the same meaning as in RCW 43.101.010.

    e. "Vehicle" has the same meaning as in RCW 46.04.670, but does not include any commercial motor vehicle as defined in RCW 46.32.005.

    b. The primary reason for the stop, and whether it was peace officer-initiated or in response to a call for service from the public;

    c. The perceived or known age, gender, race, ethnicity of the operator of the vehicle, and tribal affiliation of the operator, if applicable, and the language of interpretation used, if applicable;

    i. Whether the vehicle, personal effects, operator, or any passengers were searched, and the approximate age, gender, race, and ethnicity, if known, or tribal affiliation if applicable, of each person searched;

    j. Whether any property was seized, with a specific description of that property, or whether any contraband such as a firearm, other weapon, or narcotics was found and the specific type, size, and amount of any such contraband as applicable;

    k. Whether the stop resulted in no action, the issuance of a verbal warning, written warning, or citation, an arrest, or other action; and

    l. Whether dashboard or body worn camera footage was recorded for the incident.
