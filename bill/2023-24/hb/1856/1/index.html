<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to reaffirm its commitment to open, transparent, and accountable governance through commissioning a broad-based study on the establishment of the Washington office of transparency ombuds as a nonpartisan and independent agency. The legislature finds that residents of Washington have every right to know how their elected officials and government agencies come to critical decisions which impact their livelihoods so greatly. Barriers to accessing these records only act as a disservice to the public. The legislature further intends to build upon the foundation set by the voters through their adoption of Initiative Measure No. 276, also known as the public records act, by ensuring individuals have an independent advocate holding lawmakers and public agencies accountable as stewards of official public records.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the joint legislative audit and review committee, in coordination with the joint legislative committee on transparency established under section 3 of this act, a representative from the office of the attorney general who works in the area of open government, and the public records exemptions accountability committee created under RCW 42.56.140, shall conduct a study on the efficacy of establishing the Washington office of transparency ombuds as an independent state agency to assist individuals with accessing public records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a minimum, the study must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Include a comprehensive overview and comparison of each state's public records laws, right to know laws, open government laws, or other substantially related laws which seek to provide public access to government-produced or maintained records. The comparison must identify the aspects of chapter 42.56 RCW that are similar to the related laws of other states, as well as the aspects of chapter 42.56 RCW which substantially differ from related laws of other states;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate states with independent state agencies dedicated to serving individuals who seek to access public records, and provide findings from the evaluation. Included in the states that must be evaluated for the purpose of this subsection is Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania office of open records. This evaluation must include, but is not limited to a review of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Each state's public records and open government laws;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each state's appeals processes available to individuals who submit a public records request and are denied their request or receive an incomplete response from the agency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether litigation pertaining to public records requests has decreased after the creation of the state's independent agency; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources provided by the state to assist individuals in understanding public records and open government laws, and how to access public records;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the efficacy of establishing an independent state agency in Washington dedicated to promoting open government and assisting individuals to access public records. Efficacy must be measured by:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Potential cost savings from reduced litigation costs associated with public records requests and from decreased workloads for employees who process or otherwise respond to public records requests;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased ease of access to public records created or maintained by state or local government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential additional resources that would be made available by an independent agency to assist individuals in understanding public records laws and regulations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prospect of an independent agency to provide individuals with alternative avenues for appeal or relief when a person's public records request is denied, or when the agency's response to a person's public records request is incomplete or untimely; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommend appropriate duties of the Washington office of transparency ombuds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint legislative audit and review committee must submit a report, in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, on the findings of the study conducted pursuant to this section to the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1, 2024.</p>
</li>
