## Section 101
For the purpose of providing funds to finance the projects described and authorized by the legislature in the omnibus capital and operating appropriations acts for the 2021-2023 and 2023-2025 fiscal biennia and future biennia, and all costs incidental thereto, the state finance committee is authorized to issue general obligation bonds of the state of Washington in the sum of $4,186,076,000, or as much thereof as may be required, to finance these projects and all costs incidental thereto. Bonds authorized in this section may be sold at such price as the state finance committee shall determine. No bonds authorized in this section may be offered for sale without prior legislative appropriation of the net proceeds of the sale of the bonds.

## Section 102
1. The proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized in section 101 of this act shall be deposited in the state building construction account created by RCW 43.83.020. The proceeds shall be transferred as follows:

    a. $3,834,193,000 to remain in the state building construction account created by RCW 43.83.020;

    b. $351,883,000 to the state taxable building construction account. All receipts from taxable bonds issued are to be deposited into the account. If the state treasurer, on behalf of the state finance committee, deems it necessary or advantageous to issue more than the amount specified in this subsection (1)(b) as taxable bonds in order to comply with federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds or in order to reduce the total financing costs for bonds issued, the proceeds of such additional taxable bonds shall be transferred to the state taxable building construction account in lieu of any transfer otherwise provided by this section. If the state treasurer, on behalf of the state finance committee, determines that a portion of the amount specified in this subsection (1)(b) as taxable bonds may be issued as nontaxable bonds in compliance with federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds, then such bond proceeds shall be transferred to the state building construction account in lieu of the transfer to the state taxable building construction account otherwise provided by this subsection (1)(b). The state treasurer, on behalf of the state finance committee, shall submit written notice to the director of the office of financial management if it is determined that any such additional transfer to the state taxable building construction account is necessary or that a transfer from the state taxable building construction account to the state building construction account may be made. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.

For the purpose of providing funds to finance the projects described and authorized by the legislature in the omnibus capital and operating appropriations acts for the 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia and future biennia, and all costs incidental thereto, the state finance committee is authorized to issue general obligation bonds of the state of Washington in the sum of $3,971,290,793, or as much thereof as may be required, to finance these projects and all costs incidental thereto.

## Section 302
For the purpose of providing funds to finance the projects described and authorized by the legislature in the omnibus capital and operating appropriations acts for the 2017-2019 and 2019-2021 fiscal biennia and future biennia, and all costs incidental thereto, the state finance committee is authorized to issue general obligation bonds of the state of Washington in the sum of three billion two hundred million nine hundred twenty-six thousand dollars, or as much thereof as may be required, to finance these projects and all costs incidental thereto. Bonds authorized in this section may be sold at such price as the state finance committee shall determine. No bonds authorized in this section may be offered for sale without prior legislative appropriation of the net proceeds of the sale of the bonds.

## Section 303
The legislature acknowledges that legislation authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds of the state requires the legislature to appropriate the proceeds of sale of the bonds before the bonds may be issued. The legislature finds that the state has not fully expended all appropriations for capital projects that could have been supported by the issuance of state general obligation bonds, and that over time this under utilization of appropriation authority and the related bond issuance authority has resulted in a cumulative difference between the amount of general obligation bonds authorized and the amount of bonds actually issued. This difference is reflected in LEAP Document No. BOND-1-HB-2023, which documents a cumulative amount of unused appropriation authority and related bond issuance authority.

The difference between the amount of bonds authorized and the amount of appropriations actually expended has not been reflected in the calculation of available debt capacity under the state debt limit, and has resulted in an understatement of available debt capacity of the state. The legislature intends to address this understatement by making a one-time adjustment of $400,000,000 to the legislative balance sheet to reflect previously unused bond issuance authority enacted for the 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 fiscal biennia, and to utilize that bond issuance authority by authorizing appropriations for the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium that will be supported by that bond issuance authority.
