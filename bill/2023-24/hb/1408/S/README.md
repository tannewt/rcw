The department shall deposit any such receipts into the account. The expenditures may only be used for services defined in the grant award from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. Only the secretary or the secretary's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. An appropriation is not required for expenditures. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW.

## Section 2
