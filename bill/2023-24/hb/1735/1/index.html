<p>Washington state is invested in climate change, carbon reduction, and clean fuel standards, thus reducing carbon emissions and investing in renewable energy. Climate change comes with a large toolbox of responses, from prevention to adaptation and mitigation. While the state is focused on reducing carbon emissions, the state can also invest in restoring habitat to absorb the carbon that exists today and may exist in the future due to unforeseen circumstances. Investment in net ecological gain for local and state infrastructure projects in urban and rural areas enhances the habitat needed to absorb unforeseen carbon and restores a healthy ecosystem for salmon biomes. The state can also recognize that investment in an entire biome is an approach to addressing a biodiversity approach to recovering an entire environment and natural resources up and down river, through watersheds and into land areas. Net ecological gain is a commonsense approach for infrastructure and building projects that simply provides additional habitat to a location and results in an environmentally healthy place for natural resources and humans.</p>

<li>
<p>The department of fish and wildlife, with recommendations from the oversight body established in section 5 of this act, shall adopt rules that establish criteria for net ecological gain and consistency with the applicable regional salmon recovery plans that counties and cities that choose to adopt a voluntary net ecological gain element in their comprehensive plans must meet through adoption of their comprehensive plans in order to support salmon recovery. In adopting rules pursuant to this section, the department of fish and wildlife must consult on an early and continuous basis with each federally recognized Indian tribe with property, tribal reservation land, or usual and accustomed fishing areas in, adjacent to, or directly affected by the planning jurisdiction. The department must also communicate with governments planning under RCW 36.70A.040 during the process of adopting rules pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rules adopted under this section must address the applicable components of salmon recovery plans that local governments have authority over, such as the habitat restoration and protection elements of the recovery plans.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The rules adopted under this section must not require or assume that the proponents of individual private projects will be responsible for achieving net ecological gain. Rules adopted under this section must ensure that individual private projects achieve no net loss of ecological function. Rules adopted under this section must ensure that net ecological gain is advanced through the appropriate selection of publicly funded projects, and voluntary projects whose purpose is salmon recovery but which may receive funding from either public or private sources. Rules adopted under this section related to net ecological gain must account for the impact of the urban heat island effect on ecological function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of fish and wildlife shall monitor progress towards the goals set forth in the regional salmon recovery plans, including parameters that affect salmonid health including, but not limited to, stream temperature, impervious surfaces, and tree canopy cover. As part of its monitoring, and as appropriate, the department of fish and wildlife shall obtain monitoring data from relevant and reliable sources including, but not limited to, local governments, state agencies, federal agencies, and Indian tribes. In addition, the department of fish and wildlife shall also monitor and report the progress that each jurisdiction planning under RCW 36.70A.040 has made toward achieving no net loss of ecological function, and the progress that each jurisdiction that chooses to include a voluntary net ecological gain element in its comprehensive plan has made toward achieving net ecological gain. As part of this ongoing monitoring effort, the department of fish and wildlife, in early and continuous consultation with each federally recognized Indian tribe with property, tribal reservation land, or usual and accustomed fishing areas in, adjacent to, or directly affected by the planning jurisdiction, and in communication with the affected local governments, shall first establish the current environmental baseline conditions within each county and city planning under RCW 36.70A.040, identify any monitoring data gaps and make recommendations to fill those gaps, and monitor the degree to which each jurisdiction that chooses to include a voluntary net ecological gain element in its comprehensive plan is successful at achieving net ecological gains and no net losses through individual projects, over time, including, where appropriate, the efforts made by jurisdictions to address the effect of urban heat islands on salmonid health. The department of fish and wildlife is encouraged to work with or seek feedback from local watershed groups in review of the current environmental baseline conditions and monitoring efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of fish and wildlife shall facilitate an ongoing and collaborative process for the purpose of identifying gaps and targets related to salmon habitat and funding, to be informed by its monitoring work pursuant to this section.</p>

<p>The office of financial management shall consult with: (i) The four-year institutions of higher education in those reviews that involve four-year institutions of higher education; and (ii) the state board for community and technical colleges in those reviews that involve two-year institutions of higher education.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the legislature that each agency's budget recommendations must be directly linked to the agency's stated mission and program, quality, and productivity goals and objectives. Consistent with this policy, agency budget proposals must include integration of performance measures that allow objective determination of an activity's success in achieving its goals. When a review under subsection (4) of this section or other analysis determines that the agency's objectives demonstrate that the agency is making insufficient progress toward the goals of any particular program or is otherwise underachieving or inefficient, the agency's budget request shall contain proposals to remedy or improve the selected programs. The office of financial management shall develop a plan to merge the budget development process with agency performance assessment procedures. The plan must include a schedule to integrate agency strategic plans and performance measures into agency budget requests and the governor's budget proposal over three fiscal biennia. The plan must identify those agencies that will implement the revised budget process in the 1997-1999 biennium, the 1999-2001 biennium, and the 2001-2003 biennium. In consultation with the legislative fiscal committees, the office of financial management shall recommend statutory and procedural modifications to the state's budget, accounting, and reporting systems to facilitate the performance assessment procedures and the merger of those procedures with the state budget process. The plan and recommended statutory and procedural modifications must be submitted to the legislative fiscal committees by September 30, 1996.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In reviewing agency budget requests in order to prepare the governor's biennial budget request, the office of financial management shall consider the extent to which the agency's activities demonstrate progress toward the statewide budgeting priorities, along with any specific review conducted under subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the year of the gubernatorial election, the governor shall invite the governor-elect or the governor-elect's designee to attend all hearings provided in RCW 43.88.100; and the governor shall furnish the governor-elect or the governor-elect's designee with such information as will enable the governor-elect or the governor-elect's designee to gain an understanding of the state's budget requirements. The governor-elect or the governor-elect's designee may ask such questions during the hearings and require such information as the governor-elect or the governor-elect's designee deems necessary and may make recommendations in connection with any item of the budget which, with the governor-elect's reasons therefor, shall be presented to the legislature in writing with the budget document. Copies of all such estimates and other required information shall also be submitted to the standing committees on ways and means of the house and senate.</p>
