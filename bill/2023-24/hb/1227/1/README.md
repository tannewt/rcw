# HB 1227 - Employer health care funding

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1227.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that an important part of a comprehensive approach to providing appropriate health care for all Washington citizens involves participation by employers in providing access to health care services for their workers and their families. While most Washington citizens obtain health care services through their employment or the employment of a family member, some employers with adequate resources fail to offer affordable access to health care services to their employees in Washington state. This creates inappropriate competitive advantages for those employers and greatly increases the likelihood that their employees will not have access to affordable health care services or will receive health care services through publicly funded health care programs.

2. [Empty]

    a. It is the intent of the legislature to establish, as part of its comprehensive approach to expanding access to appropriate health care services, a mechanism to reimburse the state for its costs of providing access to appropriate health care services to Washington workers. Employer participation in this comprehensive approach allows the state to improve its financing of public health care programs and prioritize those resources on populations not served through employment. It also reduces the burden on taxpayers and the public health care system, and protects the health, safety, and well-being of all the state's residents.

    b. In establishing this program, it is not the intent of the legislature to influence the establishment, content, or administration of employee benefit plans. The legislature is neutral regarding whether employers choose to provide access to affordable health care coverage for their employees or pay an assessment to reimburse the state's costs for health care services for their employees.

## Section 2

1. "Assessment" means an amount equal to the per capita cost of providing health benefits under the medical assistance program.

    c. An employee of a franchisor's franchisees. Such employees are employees of the franchisee; or

    d. An employee who is receiving disability benefits under the federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance act.

    a. An employer that makes payments for the purpose of providing or reimbursing the cost of health care services, as defined in RCW 48.43.005, for all of its employees who are enrolled in the medical assistance program; or

    b. A seasonal employer.

Every employer shall report to the authority, within 30 days after the completion of a calendar quarter, the employees employed by the employer during the immediately preceding calendar quarter, including such information as the authority requires and in the form specified by the authority.

In the affidavit, the signing officer shall affirm that the information in the report:

The authority must identify the employees of each employer reporting under this subsection (1) who are under 65 years old and enrolled during a calendar quarter in the medical assistance program. The authority must make an actual comparison of records furnished by the employer under this subsection (1) with records of the authority and the employment security department. The authority may not disclose the names of employees identified, but must provide the employer with the number of employees identified as enrolled and other information that provides a profile of information about the characteristics of enrolled employees generally. The authority must, within 60 days after the completion of a calendar quarter, notify every employer who has employees enrolled in the medical assistance program that the employer must either:

        i. Pay an assessment specified in the notice for each employee under age 65 who is enrolled in the medical assistance program; or

        ii. Enter into an agreement with the authority with respect to each employee under age 65 who is enrolled in the medical assistance program to reimburse the authority, up to 100 percent of the cost, for the authority's contribution to the purchase of health care coverage for the employee.

    b. Enter into an agreement with the authority pursuant to subsection (1)(b)(ii) of this section.

        ii. An interest penalty of one percent per month on the assessment due; and

        iii. The suspension of eligibility for any tax preference under Title 82 or 84 RCW and any state funds for up to five years.

In such an action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the penalty is not subject to review.

## Section 4
1. An enrollee or prospective enrollee has a right to be free of interference, coercion, discrimination, or reprisal from an employer for exercising his or her rights under chapter 74.09 RCW. The remedies provided in this section are not exclusive, and an enrollee or prospective enrollee has all other rights and remedies afforded by law.

2. [Empty]

    a. An employer may not discriminate in any manner against an employee or job applicant because the person has:

        i. Made inquiries about enrollment or his or her rights to enrollment in the medical assistance program or assisted another in regard to rights to such enrollment;

        ii. Applied for or enrolled in, or communicated an intent to enroll in, the medical assistance program, caused any proceeding related to such enrollment to be instituted, or testified in any proceeding so commenced; or

    b. Any discrimination or attempt to discriminate against an employee within 90 days after notification of the employer under section 3 of this act that the employer has employees enrolled in the medical assistance program establishes a rebuttable presumption that such action was in violation of this section.

3. A person who believes that he or she has been discriminated against in violation of this section:

    a. May, within six months after the alleged act of discrimination, file a complaint with the human rights commission alleging discrimination. Upon receipt of such complaint, the human rights commission shall cause an investigation to be made as the commission deems appropriate. Within 60 days after the receipt of a complaint filed under this section, the human rights commission shall notify the complainant of his or her determination. If, after such investigation, the human rights commission determines that this section has been violated, the commission shall bring an action in the superior court of the county in which the violation is alleged to have occurred. If the human rights commission determines that this section has not been violated, the employee may institute the action on his or her own behalf as provided in (b) of this subsection, but this subsection does not require a complainant to file a complaint with the human rights commission before pursuing remedies under (b) of this subsection; and

    b. Has a civil cause of action for damages against the employer.

4. In any action brought under this section, the court shall award a prevailing plaintiff costs, including expert witness costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees and actual damages, or statutory damages of $5,000, whichever is greater, to be awarded to the aggrieved employee or job applicant. The court has jurisdiction, for cause shown, to restrain violations of this section and to order all appropriate relief including reinstatement of an employee, or hiring of a job applicant, with back pay.

5. For the purposes of this section, "discrimination" includes, but is not limited to:

    a. Refusal to employ, reemploy, or promote;

    b. Discharge from employment or demotion or suspension;

## Section 6
The authority shall:

1. Administer and enforce this chapter including, but not limited to, sending notices required in section 3 of this act, determining the amount of employer assessments, entering into negotiations and agreements with employers, and collecting employer assessments, including penalties and interest, using the procedures authorized under chapter 74.09 RCW;

2. Have authority to inspect records and conduct investigations and audits of employment and payroll, as the agencies deem necessary or appropriate, to determine whether an employer has complied with this chapter;

3. Adopt rules necessary to implement this chapter; and

Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state.

## Section 8
