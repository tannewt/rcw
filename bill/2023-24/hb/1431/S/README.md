Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, "sale" means any transfer of the ownership of, title to, or possession of property for a valuable consideration and includes any activity classified as a "sale at retail" or "retail sale" under RCW 82.04.050. It includes lease or rental, conditional sale contracts, and any contract under which possession of the property is given to the purchaser but title is retained by the vendor as security for the payment of the purchase price. It also includes the furnishing of food, drink, or meals for compensation whether consumed upon the premises or not. The term "sale" does not include the transfer of the ownership of, title to, or possession of:

    a. An animal by an animal rescue organization in exchange for the payment of an adoption fee;

    b. An abandoned vehicle sold by a registered tow truck operator to a successful bidder at public auction or, if there is no successful bidder, to a licensed vehicle wrecker, hulk hauler, or scrap processor, as provided in RCW 46.55.130. Nothing in this subsection (1)(b) may be construed as providing an exemption from:

        i. The tax imposed by chapter 82.12 RCW on the use of an abandoned vehicle by any consumer; or

        ii. Taxes imposed under this chapter and chapter 82.08 RCW on automobile towing and automobile storage services provided by a registered tow truck operator; or

    c. Food, drink, or meals furnished by a senior living community to tenants as part of a rental or residency agreement for which no separate charge is made, regardless of whether the tenant is a resident for purposes of chapter 18.20 or 18.390 RCW.

Sec. 7701(h)(1), as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2003. The definition in this subsection (3) must be used for sales and use tax purposes regardless if a transaction is characterized as a lease or rental under generally accepted accounting principles, the United States internal revenue code, Washington state's commercial code, or other provisions of federal, state, or local law.

    b. "Lease or rental" does not include:

        i. A transfer of possession or control of property under a security agreement or deferred payment plan that requires the transfer of title upon completion of the required payments;
