# HB 1440 - Juvenile court jurisdiction

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1440.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the goal of the juvenile justice system should be to protect public safety, connect youth with age-appropriate services that reduce the risk of recidivism, and provide meaningful rehabilitation so all youth can have the opportunity for success in life. The legislature declares that responses to problematic behaviors of youth should be guided by evidence-based practices and that policy changes to the system should be strongly rooted in eliminating racial inequities.

The legislature recognizes that a scientific consensus has developed that demonstrates that youth continue to develop neurologically until age 26. The legislature finds that young children, ages eight through 13, are less capable of making fully informed, reasoned decisions. The legislature further finds that young adults ages 18, 19, and 20 are particularly susceptible to outside factors influencing their decision making.

The legislature recognizes that on January 18, 2021, the Washington state board of health released a review regarding the health impacts of raising the age of the juvenile court's jurisdiction to likely decrease the juvenile criminal legal system's involvement for young children and to likely decrease the adult criminal legal system's involvement for young adults. The board further found very strong evidence that this would decrease juvenile recidivism and improve health outcomes, access to employment opportunities, housing access, and economic stability.

The legislature resolves to amend jurisdiction of juvenile court to include youth ages 14 through 20 by July 1, 2027. The legislature recognizes the important role that local governments play in ensuring access to justice in the juvenile court system. The legislature recognizes that amended jurisdiction in juvenile court may increase expenses for juvenile court systems despite significant offset savings in the adult system through reduced adult caseloads. The legislature intends to partner with local governments, courts, and other stakeholders to ensure successful expansion of juvenile court jurisdiction. The legislature therefore resolves to convene the raise the age juvenile justice task force to examine and plan for implementation of expanded juvenile court jurisdiction.

## Section 3
Children age 13 and younger are incapable of committing crime. Children of eight through 13 years of age who are charged with murder in the first or second degree are presumed to be incapable of committing crime, but this presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that they have sufficient capacity to understand the act or neglect, and to know that it was wrong. Whenever in legal proceedings it becomes necessary to determine the age of a child, he or she may be produced for inspection, to enable the court or jury to determine the age thereby; and the court may also direct his or her examination by one or more physicians, whose opinion shall be competent evidence upon the question of his or her age.

## Section 4
1. The administrative office of the courts shall encourage the juvenile courts to work with cities and counties to implement, expand, or use youth court programs for juveniles who commit diversion-eligible offenses, civil, or traffic infractions.

    a. Are developed using the guidelines for creating and operating youth court programs developed by nationally recognized experts in youth court projects;

    b. Target offenders age 14 through 17; and

    c. Emphasize the following principles:

        i. Youth must be held accountable for their problem behavior;

        ii. Youth must be educated about the impact their actions have on themselves and others including their victims, their families, and their community;

        iii. Youth must develop skills to resolve problems with their peers more effectively; and

        iv. Youth should be provided a meaningful forum to practice and enhance newly developed skills.

2. Youth court programs under this section may be established by private nonprofit organizations and schools, upon prior approval and under the supervision of juvenile court.
