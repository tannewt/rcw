<li>A health care provider may subject another health care provider to the sanctions stated in this subsection if the sanctioning health care provider has notified the sanctioned provider before participation in chapter 1, Laws of 2009 that it prohibits participation in chapter 1, Laws of 2009:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<pre><code>c. A health care provider that imposes sanctions under (b) of this subsection shall follow all due process and other procedures the sanctioning health care provider may have that are related to the imposition of sanctions on another health care provider.

d. For the purposes of this subsection:

    i. &quot;Notify&quot; means a separate statement in writing to the health care provider specifically informing the health care provider before the provider's participation in chapter 1, Laws of 2009 of the sanctioning health care provider's policy about participation in activities covered by this chapter.

</code></pre>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Suspension or termination of staff membership or privileges under subsection (2) of this section is not reportable under RCW 18.130.070. Action taken under RCW 70.245.030, 70.245.040, 70.245.050, or 70.245.060 may not be the sole basis for a report of unprofessional conduct under RCW 18.130.180.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>References to &quot;good faith&quot; in subsection (1)(a), (b), and (c) of this section do not allow a lower standard of care for health care providers in the state of Washington.</p>
