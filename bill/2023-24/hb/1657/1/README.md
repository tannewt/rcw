## Section 1
The following named officers and persons, active or retired, are hereby authorized to solemnize marriages, to wit: Justices of the supreme court; judges of the court of appeals; judges of the superior courts; supreme court commissioners; court of appeals commissioners; superior court commissioners; judges and commissioners of courts of limited jurisdiction as defined in RCW 3.02.010; justices of the supreme court of the United States; judges and judicial officers of the federal courts; judges of tribal courts from a federally recognized tribe; and any regularly licensed or ordained minister or any priest, imam, rabbi, or similar official of any religious organization. The solemnization of a marriage by a tribal court judge pursuant to authority under this section does not create tribal court jurisdiction and does not affect state court authority as otherwise provided by law to enter a judgment for purposes of any dissolution, legal separation, or other proceedings related to the marriage that is binding on the parties and entitled to full faith and credit.
