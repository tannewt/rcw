# HB 1110 - Middle housing

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/1110-S2.PL.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington is facing an unprecedented housing crisis for its current population and a lack of housing choices, and is not likely to meet the affordability goals for future populations. In order to meet the goal of 1,000,000 new homes by 2044, and enhanced quality of life and environmental protection, innovative housing policies will need to be adopted.

Increasing housing options that are more affordable to various income levels is critical to achieving the state's housing goals, including those codified by the legislature under chapter 254, Laws of 2021.

There is continued need for the development of housing at all income levels, including middle housing that will provide a wider variety of housing options and configurations to allow Washingtonians to live near where they work.

Homes developed at higher densities are more affordable by design for Washington residents both in their construction and reduced household energy and transportation costs.

While creating more housing options, it is essential for cities to identify areas at higher risk of displacement and establish antidisplacement policies as required in Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1220 (chapter 254, Laws of 2021).

The state has made historic investments in subsidized affordable housing through the housing trust fund, yet even with these historic investments, the magnitude of the housing shortage requires both public and private investment.

In addition to addressing the housing shortage, allowing more housing options in areas already served by urban infrastructure will reduce the pressure to develop natural and working lands, support key strategies for climate change, food security, and Puget Sound recovery, and save taxpayers and ratepayers money.

## Section 2
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Administrative design review" means a development permit process whereby an application is reviewed, approved, or denied by the planning director or the planning director's designee based solely on objective design and development standards without a public predecision hearing, unless such review is otherwise required by state or federal law, or the structure is a designated landmark or historic district established under a local preservation ordinance.

36. "Urban growth" refers to growth that makes intensive use of land for the location of buildings, structures, and impermeable surfaces to such a degree as to be incompatible with the primary use of land for the production of food, other agricultural products, or fiber, or the extraction of mineral resources, rural uses, rural development, and natural resource lands designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.170. A pattern of more intensive rural development, as provided in RCW 36.70A.070(5)(d), is not urban growth. When allowed to spread over wide areas, urban growth typically requires urban governmental services. "Characterized by urban growth" refers to land having urban growth located on it, or to land located in relationship to an area with urban growth on it as to be appropriate for urban growth.

37. "Urban growth areas" means those areas designated by a county pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110.

Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

## Section 3
1. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, any city that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 must provide by ordinance and incorporate into its development regulations, zoning regulations, and other official controls, authorization for the following:

    a. For cities with a population of at least 25,000 but less than 75,000 based on office of financial management population estimates:

        i. The development of at least two units per lot on all lots zoned predominantly for residential use, unless zoning permitting higher densities or intensities applies;

        ii. The development of at least four units per lot on all lots zoned predominantly for residential use, unless zoning permitting higher densities or intensities applies, within one-quarter mile walking distance of a major transit stop; and

        iii. The development of at least four units per lot on all lots zoned predominantly for residential use, unless zoning permitting higher densities or intensities applies, if at least one unit is affordable housing.

    b. For cities with a population of at least 75,000 based on office of financial management population estimates:

        i. The development of at least four units per lot on all lots zoned predominantly for residential use, unless zoning permitting higher densities or intensities applies;

        ii. The development of at least six units per lot on all lots zoned predominantly for residential use, unless zoning permitting higher densities or intensities applies, within one-quarter mile walking distance of a major transit stop; and

        iii. The development of at least six units per lot on all lots zoned predominantly for residential use, unless zoning permitting higher densities or intensities applies, if at least two units are affordable housing.

    c. For cities with a population of less than 25,000, that are within a contiguous urban growth area with the largest city in a county with a population of more than 275,000, based on office of financial management population estimates the development of at least two units per lot on all lots zoned predominantly for residential use, unless zoning permitting higher densities or intensities applies.

2. [Empty]

    a. To qualify for the additional units allowed under subsection (1) of this section, the applicant must commit to renting or selling the required number of units as affordable housing. The units must be maintained as affordable for a term of at least 50 years, and the property must satisfy that commitment and all required affordability and income eligibility conditions adopted by the local government under this chapter. A city must require the applicant to record a covenant or deed restriction that ensures the continuing rental of units subject to these affordability requirements consistent with the conditions in chapter 84.14 RCW for a period of no less than 50 years. The covenant or deed restriction must also address criteria and policies to maintain public benefit if the property is converted to a use other than which continues to provide for permanently affordable housing.

    b. The units dedicated as affordable must be provided in a range of sizes comparable to other units in the development. To the extent practicable, the number of bedrooms in affordable units must be in the same proportion as the number of bedrooms in units within the entire development. The affordable units must generally be distributed throughout the development and have substantially the same functionality as the other units in the development.

    c. If a city has enacted a program under RCW 36.70A.540, the terms of that program govern to the extent they vary from the requirements of this subsection.

3. If a city has enacted a program under RCW 36.70A.540, subsection (1) of this section does not preclude the city from requiring any development, including development described in subsection (1) of this section, to provide affordable housing, either on-site or through an in-lieu payment, nor limit the city's ability to expand such a program or modify its requirements.

4. [Empty]

    a. As an alternative to the density requirements in subsection (1) of this section, a city may implement the density requirements in subsection (1) of this section for at least 75 percent of lots in the city that are primarily dedicated to single-family detached housing units.

    b. The 25 percent of lots for which the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are not implemented must include but are not limited to:

        i. Any areas within the city for which the department has certified an extension of the implementation timelines under section 5 of this act due to the risk of displacement;

        ii. Any areas within the city for which the department has certified an extension of the implementation timelines under section 7 of this act due to a lack of infrastructure capacity;

        iii. Any lots designated with critical areas or their buffers that are exempt from the density requirements as provided in subsection (8) of this section;

        iv. Any portion of a city within a one-mile radius of a commercial airport with at least 9,000,000 annual enplanements that is exempt from the parking requirements under subsection (7)(b) of this section; and

    v. Any areas subject to sea level rise, increased flooding, susceptible to wildfires, or geological hazards over the next 100 years.

    c. Unless identified as at higher risk of displacement under RCW 36.70A.070(2)(g), the 25 percent of lots for which the requirements of subsection (1) of this section are not implemented may not include:

        i. Any areas for which the exclusion would further racially disparate impacts or result in zoning with a discriminatory effect;

        ii. Any areas within one-half mile walking distance of a major transit stop; or

        iii. Any areas historically covered by a covenant or deed restriction excluding racial minorities from owning property or living in the area, as known to the city at the time of each comprehensive plan update.

5. A city must allow at least six of the nine types of middle housing to achieve the unit density required in subsection (1) of this section. A city may allow accessory dwelling units to achieve the unit density required in subsection (1) of this section. Cities are not required to allow accessory dwelling units or middle housing types beyond the density requirements in subsection (1) of this section. A city must also allow zero lot line short subdivision where the number of lots created is equal to the unit density required in subsection (1) of this section.

6. Any city subject to the requirements of this section:

    a. If applying design review for middle housing, only administrative design review shall be required;

    b. Except as provided in (a) of this subsection, shall not require through development regulations any standards for middle housing that are more restrictive than those required for detached single-family residences, but may apply any objective development regulations that are required for detached single-family residences, including, but not limited to, set-back, lot coverage, stormwater, clearing, and tree canopy and retention requirements to ensure compliance with existing ordinances intended to protect critical areas and public health and safety;

    c. Shall apply to middle housing the same development permit and environmental review processes that apply to detached single-family residences, unless otherwise required by state law including, but not limited to, shoreline regulations under chapter 90.58 RCW, building codes under chapter 19.27 RCW, energy codes under chapter 19.27A RCW, or electrical codes under chapter 19.28 RCW;

    d. Shall not require off-street parking as a condition of permitting development of middle housing within one-half mile walking distance of a major transit stop;

    e. Shall not require more than one off-street parking space per unit as a condition of permitting development of middle housing on lots smaller than 6,000 square feet before any zero lot line subdivisions or lot splits;

    f. Shall not require more than two off-street parking spaces per unit as a condition of permitting development of middle housing on lots greater than 6,000 square feet before any zero lot line subdivisions or lot splits; and

    g. Are not required to achieve the per unit density under this act on lots after subdivision below 1,000 square feet unless the city chooses to enact smaller allowable lot sizes.

7. The provisions of subsection (6)(d) through (f) of this section do not apply:

    a. If a local government submits to the department an empirical study prepared by a credentialed transportation or land use planning expert that clearly demonstrates, and the department finds and certifies, that the application of the parking limitations of subsection (6)(d) through (f) of this section for middle housing will be significantly less safe for vehicle drivers or passengers, pedestrians, or bicyclists than if the jurisdiction's parking requirements were applied to the same location for the same number of detached houses. The department must develop guidance to assist cities on items to include in the study; or

    b. To portions of cities within a one-mile radius of a commercial airport in Washington with at least 9,000,000 annual enplanements.

8. The provisions of this section do not apply to:

    a. Lots designated with critical areas designated under RCW 36.70A.170 or their buffers as required by RCW 36.70A.170;

    b. 12 months after their next implementation progress report required under RCW 36.70A.130 after a determination by the office of financial management that the city has reached a population threshold established under this section.

12. A city complying with this section and not granted a timeline extension under section 7 of this act does not have to update its capital facilities plan element required by RCW 36.70A.070(3) to accommodate the increased housing required by this act until the first periodic comprehensive plan update required for the city under RCW 36.70A.130(5) that occurs on or after June 30, 2034.

## Section 4
1. [Empty]

    a. The department is directed to provide technical assistance to cities as they implement the requirements under section 3 of this act.

    b. The department shall prioritize such technical assistance to cities demonstrating the greatest need.

2. [Empty]

    a. The department shall publish model middle housing ordinances no later than six months following the effective date of this section.

    b. In any city subject to section 3 of this act that has not passed ordinances, regulations, or other official controls within the time frames provided under section 3(11) of this act, the model ordinance supersedes, preempts, and invalidates local development regulations until the city takes all actions necessary to implement section 3 of this act.

3. [Empty]

    a. The department is directed to establish a process by which cities implementing the requirements of section 3 of this act may seek approval of alternative local action necessary to meet the requirements of this act.

    b. The department may approve actions under this section for cities that have, by January 1, 2023, adopted a comprehensive plan that is substantially similar to the requirements of this act and have adopted, or within one year of the effective date of this section adopts, permanent development regulations that are substantially similar to the requirements of this act. In determining whether a city's adopted comprehensive plan and permanent development regulations are substantially similar, the department must find as substantially similar plans and regulations that:

        i. Result in an overall increase in housing units allowed in single-family zones that is at least 75 percent of the increase in housing units allowed in single-family zones if the specific provisions of this act were adopted;

        ii. Allow for middle housing throughout the city, rather than just in targeted locations; and

        iii. Allow for additional density near major transit stops, and for projects that incorporate dedicated affordable housing.

    c. The department may also approve actions under this section for cities that have, by January 1, 2023, adopted a comprehensive plan or development regulations that have significantly reduced or eliminated residentially zoned areas that are predominantly single family. The department must find that a city's actions are substantially similar to the requirements of this act if they have adopted, or within one year of the effective date of this section adopts, permanent development regulations that:

        i. Result in an overall increase in housing units allowed in single-family zones that is at least 75 percent of the increase in housing units allowed in single-family zones if the specific provisions of this act were adopted;

        ii. Allow for middle housing throughout the city, rather than just in targeted locations; and

        iii. Allow for additional density near major transit stops, and for projects that incorporate dedicated affordable housing.

    d. The department may determine that a comprehensive plan and development regulations that do not meet these criteria are otherwise substantially similar to the requirements of this act if the city can clearly demonstrate that the regulations adopted will allow for a greater increase in middle housing production within single family zones than would be allowed through implementation of section 3 of this act.

    e. Any local actions approved by the department pursuant to (a) of this subsection to implement the requirements under section 3 of this act are exempt from appeals under this chapter and chapter 43.21C RCW.

    f. The department's final decision to approve or reject actions by cities implementing section 3 of this act may be appealed to the growth management hearings board by filing a petition as provided in RCW 36.70A.290.

4. The department may issue guidance for local jurisdictions to ensure that the levels of middle housing zoning under this act can be integrated with the methods used by cities to calculate zoning densities and intensities in local zoning and development regulations.

## Section 5
Any city choosing the alternative density requirements in section 3(4) of this act may apply to the department for, and the department may certify, an extension for areas at risk of displacement as determined by the antidisplacement analysis that a jurisdiction is required to complete under RCW 36.70A.070(2). The city must create a plan for implementing antidisplacement policies by their next implementation progress report required by RCW 36.70A.130(9). The department may certify one further extension based on evidence of significant ongoing displacement risk in the impacted area.

## Section 6
1. The growth management hearings board shall hear and determine only those petitions alleging either:

    a. That, except as provided otherwise by this subsection, a state agency, county, or city planning under this chapter is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, chapter 90.58 RCW as it relates to the adoption of shoreline master programs or amendments thereto, or chapter 43.21C RCW as it relates to plans, development regulations, or amendments, adopted under RCW 36.70A.040 or chapter 90.58 RCW. Nothing in this subsection authorizes the board to hear petitions alleging noncompliance with RCW 36.70A.5801;

    b. That the twenty-year growth management planning population projections adopted by the office of financial management pursuant to RCW 43.62.035 should be adjusted;

    c. That the approval of a work plan adopted under RCW 36.70A.735(1)(a) is not in compliance with the requirements of the program established under RCW 36.70A.710;

    d. That regulations adopted under RCW 36.70A.735(1)(b) are not regionally applicable and cannot be adopted, wholly or partially, by another jurisdiction;

    e. That a department certification under RCW 36.70A.735(1)(c) is erroneous; or

    f. That the department's final decision to approve or reject actions by a city implementing section 3 of this act is clearly erroneous.

2. A petition may be filed only by: (a) The state, or a county or city that plans under this chapter; (b) a person who has participated orally or in writing before the county or city regarding the matter on which a review is being requested; (c) a person who is certified by the governor within sixty days of filing the request with the board; or (d) a person qualified pursuant to RCW 34.05.530.

3. For purposes of this section "person" means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, state agency, governmental subdivision or unit thereof, or public or private organization or entity of any character.

4. To establish participation standing under subsection (2)(b) of this section, a person must show that his or her participation before the county or city was reasonably related to the person's issue as presented to the board.

5. When considering a possible adjustment to a growth management planning population projection prepared by the office of financial management, the board shall consider the implications of any such adjustment to the population forecast for the entire state.

The rationale for any adjustment that is adopted by the board must be documented and filed with the office of financial management within ten working days after adoption.

If adjusted by the board, a county growth management planning population projection shall only be used for the planning purposes set forth in this chapter and shall be known as the "board adjusted population projection." None of these changes shall affect the official state and county population forecasts prepared by the office of financial management, which shall continue to be used for state budget and planning purposes.

## Section 7
1. Any city choosing the alternative density requirements in section 3(4) of this act may apply to the department for, and the department may certify, an extension of the implementation timelines established under section 3(11) of this act.

2. An extension certified under this section may be applied only to specific areas where a city can demonstrate that water, sewer, stormwater, transportation infrastructure, including facilities and transit services, or fire protection services lack capacity to accommodate the density required in section 3 of this act, and the city has:

    a. Included one or more improvements, as needed, within its capital facilities plan to adequately increase capacity; or

    b. Identified which special district is responsible for providing the necessary infrastructure if the infrastructure is provided by a special purpose district.

3. If an extension of the implementation timelines is requested due to lack of water supply from the city or the purveyors who serve water within the city, the department's evaluation of the extension must be based on the applicable water system plans in effect and approved by the department of health. Water system plan updates initiated after the effective date of this section must include consideration of water supply requirements for middle housing types.

4. An extension granted under this section remains in effect until the earliest of:

    a. The infrastructure is improved to accommodate the capacity;

    b. The city's deadline to complete its next periodic comprehensive plan update under RCW 36.70A.130; or

    c. The city's deadline to complete its implementation progress report to the department as required under RCW 36.70A.130(9).

5. A city that has received an extension under this section may reapply for any needed extension with its next periodic comprehensive plan update under RCW 36.70A.130 or its implementation progress report to the department under RCW 36.70A.130(9). The application for an additional extension must include a list of infrastructure improvements necessary to meet the capacity required in section 3 of this act. Such additional extension must only be to address infrastructure deficiency that a city is not reasonably able to address within the first extension.

6. The department may establish by rule any standards or procedures necessary to implement this section.

7. The department must provide the legislature with a list of projects identified in a city's capital facilities plan that were the basis for the extension under this section, including planning level estimates. Additionally, the city must contact special purpose districts to identify additional projects associated with extensions under this section.

8. A city granted an extension for a specific area must allow development as provided under section 3 of this act if the developer commits to providing the necessary water, sewer, or stormwater infrastructure.

9. If an area zoned predominantly for residential use is currently served only by private wells, group B water systems or group A water systems with less than 50 connections, or a city or water providers within the city do not have an adequate water supply or available connections to serve the zoning increase required under section 3 of this act, the city may limit the areas subject to the requirements under section 3 of this act to match current water availability. Nothing in this act affects or modifies the responsibilities of cities to plan for or provide urban governmental services as defined in RCW 36.70A.030 or affordable housing as required by RCW 36.70A.070.

10. No city shall approve a building permit for housing under section 3 of this act without compliance with the adequate water supply requirements of RCW 19.27.097.

11. If an area zoned predominantly for residential use is currently served only by on-site sewage systems, development may be limited to two units per lot, until either the landowner or local government provides sewer service or demonstrates a sewer system will serve the development at the time of construction. Nothing in this act affects or modifies the responsibilities of cities to plan for or provide urban governmental services as defined in RCW 36.70A.030.
