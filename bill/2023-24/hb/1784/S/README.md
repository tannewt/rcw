## Section 1
Appropriations in this act are for the fiscal biennium ending June 30, 2023.

## Section 2
The legislature recognizes that food insecurity has many negative impacts on health and well-being. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the legislature has prioritized meeting people's basic needs, including investing in getting fresh food from Washington farmers to families, expanding the community eligibility provision so thousands of low-income students can enjoy healthy nutritious meals, providing additional funding for seniors to spend at local farmers markets, and supporting the emergency food system.

The legislature finds that even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, one in 10 Washington households were food insecure. Food insecurity rates rose when the pandemic began and have remained high, especially for those with very low incomes, Black and Hispanic households, families with children, young adults, and military veterans.

The legislature further finds that the cost of food and fuel has increased significantly in the past year. Supply challenges and food prices affect consumers and businesses alike, and this is simultaneously affecting low-income people and the emergency food system that is intended to respond to rising need.

The legislature further finds that many of the worst impacts of high food prices and economic instability have been avoided by increased federal support for the basic food program. Recent congressional action ends additional emergency allotments to basic food after February 2023, resulting in a loss of $93 million per month in federal food assistance to Washington households living at or below the federal poverty line. Low-income households most likely to experience the largest loss of basic food benefits are seniors, people with disabilities, families with children, and single adult men.

The legislature intends to provide support to people who are most impacted by the loss of basic food, from young children to seniors. This includes providing funding to support food banks to provide emergency food supplies to families, increases in the fruit and vegetable incentive program that helps families stretch their basic food dollars further, and senior nutrition programs that provide meals to people who might otherwise go hungry.

The appropriation in this section is subject to the following conditions and limitations: The appropriation in this section is provided solely for senior nutrition services programs operated by area agencies on aging to provide nutrition services for seniors, prioritizing services for those who have been most impacted by the loss of federal resources under the supplemental nutrition assistance program that were provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding may also be used for outreach activities to target the populations most impacted.
