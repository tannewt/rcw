# HB 1087 - Solitary confinement

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1087.pdf)

## Section 1
This act may be known and cited as the solitary confinement restriction act.

## Section 2
The legislature finds that almost 600 adults continue to be held in solitary confinement in state correctional facilities. Solitary confinement has been shown to create significant and lasting psychological impacts. Therefore, the legislature finds that the use of solitary confinement in state correctional facilities should be restricted to ensure the safe and humane operation of these facilities, consistent with the state and federal Constitutions, the laws and public policies of this state, the mission of the correctional system, evolving medical knowledge, and international human rights standards. The standards established in this act apply to all incarcerated persons in the custody of the department of corrections.

The legislature also finds that people are held in similar conditions in other facilities, including those operated by private contractors for longer term detention. Due to the damage caused by solitary confinement over long periods, these facilities present similar risks to the safety and welfare of Washingtonians and solitary confinement within such facilities should be similarly restricted.

The legislature further finds that solitary confinement is occurring in local jails, and that additional data is needed in order to accurately assess the use of solitary confinement in these settings and what reforms may be needed in the future.

## Section 5
An incarcerated or detained person may be placed in solitary confinement for emergency purposes if: The person has not been determined to be a vulnerable person; the superintendent of the correctional facility or the person in charge of the detention facility finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that the solitary confinement is necessary to reduce or protect against a substantial risk of immediate serious harm to the person or another person, as evidenced by recent threats or conduct; and the superintendent of the correctional facility or the person in charge of the detention facility finds that a less restrictive intervention would insufficiently reduce this risk.

2. INITIAL MEDICAL EVALUATION. (a)(i) Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, a qualified medical provider shall conduct a personal and comprehensive medical and mental health examination of the incarcerated or detained person within 24 hours of the person being placed in solitary confinement under this section.

        ii. A person who has been involved in an altercation or use of force must be examined by a qualified medical provider prior to being placed in solitary confinement.

    b. The comprehensive medical and mental health examination must include an assessment as to whether the person is a vulnerable person and whether the person's age or circumstance makes them particularly vulnerable to the harm of isolation, such that the person should be considered a vulnerable person. The examining qualified medical provider shall immediately report to the superintendent of the correctional facility or the person in charge of the detention facility if he or she makes any finding indicating that the person is vulnerable or that for any other reason continued placement in solitary confinement would be a risk to the person's health.

        i. A qualified medical provider shall, every seven days, conduct a mental health and physical health status examination of the person, in a confidential setting outside of the cell unless doing so would present a substantial threat to security or safety or the person refuses to leave the cell. These examinations must be more frequent if indicated by the person's documented clinical needs pertaining to his or her identified health or health care concerns; and

        ii. The department or the detention facility shall provide the incarcerated or detained person with timely, fair, and meaningful opportunities to contest the extended solitary confinement, including: An initial hearing within 72 hours of placement, unless emergency circumstances require a continuance which may be up to an additional 48 hours; the right to appear at the hearing; the right to request assistance at the hearing by a lay advisor or other person of the incarcerated or detained person's choosing, including but not limited to other incarcerated or detained individuals when such individuals do not present an individualized and specific risk if permitted to participate, outside advocates, or retained counsel; an independent hearing officer; a written statement of reasons for the decision made at the hearing; and a written statement on how to appeal a hearing determination.

4. VULNERABLE PERSONS. If the incarcerated or detained person is determined to be a vulnerable person during the initial examination under subsection (2) of this section or any status examination under subsection (3)(b) of this section, then the person must not be placed in solitary confinement or must be removed from solitary confinement and, if necessary, transferred to an appropriate residential treatment unit, medical unit, or other appropriate or specialized unit designated by the secretary or the person in charge of the detention facility. If the person is identified as a vulnerable person due to having a mental disorder or developmental disability, as identified in RCW 72.09.015, the person may also be screened by a qualified medical provider for transfer to the least restrictive appropriate short-term care or psychiatric facility designated by the department of social and health services and transferred to such facility if the requirements in RCW 72.68.031 have been met.

## Section 6
1. An incarcerated or detained person may be placed in solitary confinement for medical isolation if the facility medical director determines, based on a personal examination, that such confinement is necessary for medical reasons, which may include, but are not limited to, responding to a medical or mental health emergency, and no less restrictive intervention is sufficient to protect health and safety. Conditions of solitary confinement under this section must be the least restrictive possible and must be in compliance with prevailing public health guidance including, but not limited to, guidance from the United States centers for disease control and prevention and the Washington state department of health.

2. For any person placed in solitary confinement under this section, an in-person clinical assessment must be conducted at clinically appropriate intervals as determined by a qualified medical provider, provided such assessments occur no less frequently than every 12 hours. A person in solitary confinement under this section must be placed in a general population living unit, a residential treatment unit, a close observation unit, or a medical unit designated by the secretary, as deemed clinically appropriate by the attending qualified medical provider in consultation with the facility medical director.

3. A person may not be placed in solitary confinement under this section for more than 15 consecutive days and for more than 45 cumulative days during a single fiscal year, unless a qualified medical provider determines that additional time is necessary: To prevent the spread of a disease and continued medical isolation is consistent with applicable United States centers for disease control and prevention or Washington state department of health guidelines; to facilitate the provision of medical treatment to the person; or for some other clearly stated medical purpose. If additional time is deemed necessary, the medical provider shall document specific reasons why the isolation is required and why less restrictive interventions are insufficient to accomplish the safety of incarcerated or detained persons in the facility. Such notice must be forwarded to the facility medical director and superintendent of the correctional facility or person in charge of the detention facility for consideration and final approval.

## Section 7
1. An incarcerated or detained person may be voluntarily placed in solitary confinement if: The person has capacity to make an informed decision about placement in solitary confinement; there is reasonable cause to believe that solitary confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm; and the person voluntarily requests such confinement conditions.

2. A person may be placed in solitary confinement under this section only if the person provides informed consent. Whenever possible, a person's request for placement in solitary confinement must be in the form of a written request. If an incarcerated or detained person initiates an informed request for solitary confinement under this section, the correctional or detention facility must document the request and has the burden of establishing a basis for refusing the request. The department or the detention facility shall maintain a written record of any request provided under this section. Prior to declining a request or removing a person who previously requested solitary confinement under this section, the department or the detention facility shall provide the incarcerated or detained person with a timely, fair, and meaningful opportunity to contest the decision. A person in solitary confinement under this section may revoke his or her request to such confinement conditions, in which case the correctional or detention facility must document the request and the person must be transferred to a less restrictive intervention or other appropriate setting within 15 days.

3. LESS RESTRICTIVE INTERVENTION. The department or the detention facility shall make a less restrictive intervention available to any incarcerated or detained person requesting solitary confinement who meets the standard under subsection (1) of this section, which may include provision of accommodations in the general population, a transfer to the general population of another institution or to a unit designated for persons who face similar threats, or other specialized housing, as appropriate. A transfer to an out-of-state facility is not a less restrictive intervention under this section unless such a transfer is requested by the incarcerated or detained person. The department or the detention facility shall notify the incarcerated or detained person of the available less restrictive intervention when receiving any request under subsection (1) of this section and shall formulate an individualized intervention plan that addresses the support or services the person may need to move to a less restrictive intervention.

4. A person who has requested solitary confinement under this section must be assessed by a qualified medical provider every 90 days. If the qualified medical provider finds that continued placement in solitary confinement would be detrimental to the health or well-being of the person, the person must be transferred to a less restrictive intervention.

## Section 8
1. The department and long-term private detention facilities shall maximize the amount of time that any incarcerated or detained person held in solitary confinement spends outside of the cell by providing outdoor and indoor recreation, education, clinically appropriate treatment therapies, and skill-building activities. Cells or other holding or living spaces used for solitary confinement must be properly ventilated, appropriately lit according to the time of day, temperature-monitored, clean, and equipped with properly functioning sanitary fixtures.

2. The department and any long-term private detention facility may not deny an incarcerated or detained person held in solitary confinement access to food, water, or any other basic necessity, or access to appropriate medical care, including emergency medical care.

3. The department and any long-term private detention facility may not deny an incarcerated or detained person held in solitary confinement access to the telephone, personal communication or media devices, reading materials, or personal hygiene items unless an individualized assessment determines that limitation of such items is directly necessary for the safety of the person or others. The department and any long-term private detention facilities may use restraints upon a person in solitary confinement to facilitate movement or programming if an individualized assessment determines such restraint is directly necessary for the safety of the incarcerated or detained person or others.

4. The department and any long-term private detention facility may not directly release an incarcerated or detained person from solitary confinement to the community, unless it is necessary for the safety of the person, staff, other incarcerated or detained persons, or the public, or in circumstances in which the person requires an immediate release due to resentencing.

5. The department and any long-term private detention facility may not place an incarcerated or detained person in solitary confinement based on the person's race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, domestic partnership or civil union status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, sex, gender identity or expression, disability, or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait.

## Section 9
1. By April 1, 2024, the department and all long-term private detention facilities shall review the status of each incarcerated or detained person in solitary confinement. The department and detention facilities shall develop a plan to transition those incarcerated or detained persons to less restrictive interventions or other appropriate settings. Any person who has been in solitary confinement for longer than 120 days in the prior 12 months as of July 1, 2024, must have a trauma-informed, culturally appropriate individualized intervention plan to facilitate a transition to a less restrictive intervention, which may include an evaluation for possible single cell placement, access to and treatment by medical and mental health providers, peer supports, substance abuse programming, restorative justice programming, behavioral programming, or other individualized interventions or accommodations.

2. By January 1, 2024, the secretary shall adopt any rules or policies necessary to implement sections 4 through 8 of this act, including for the purposes of:
