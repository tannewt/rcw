<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated for this specific purpose, by June 1, 2024, the Washington courts' board for judicial administration must develop model standards:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Establishing best practices for the operation of electronic monitoring with victim notification technology by monitoring agencies, with the goal of improving victim safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing protocols for implementing court orders that include electronic monitoring with victim notification, including protocols for the installation and removal of monitoring devices to ensure uninterrupted monitoring services following release from detainment or incarceration; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing any additional requirements necessary to promote compliance with RCW 2.56.260 and 9.94A.736, which may include, but not be limited to, training requirements for court officials, peace officers, 911 dispatchers, local corrections officers and staff, and other appropriate practitioners.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the standards required under this section, the Washington courts' board for judicial administration must solicit input from courts of general and limited jurisdiction, local governments, monitoring agencies, and statewide associations representing law enforcement leaders, prosecutors, the department of corrections, domestic violence victims, and domestic violence agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated for this specific purpose, the Washington courts' board for judicial administration must develop a model policy on electronic monitoring with victim notification technology based on best practices where the technology is being currently used in Washington. Each law enforcement agency in the state must adopt its own policy based on the model policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Electronic monitoring&quot; has the meaning provided in RCW 9.94A.030; and</p>

<p>When service is to be completed under this chapter by a law enforcement officer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The clerk of the court shall have a copy of any order issued under this chapter, the confidential information form, as well as the petition for a protection order and any supporting materials, electronically forwarded on or before the next judicial day to the law enforcement agency in the county or municipality where the respondent resides, as specified in the order, for service upon the respondent. If the respondent has moved from that county or municipality and personal service is not required, the law enforcement agency specified in the order may serve the order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service of an order issued under this chapter must take precedence over the service of other documents by law enforcement unless they are of a similar emergency nature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where personal service is required, the first attempt at service must occur within 24 hours of receiving the order from the court unless an emergency situation renders the service infeasible. If an emergency situation prevents a first attempt at service within 24 hours, law enforcement must attempt service as soon as possible. If the first attempt is not successful, no fewer than two additional attempts should be made to serve the order, particularly for respondents who present heightened risk of lethality or other risk of physical harm to the petitioner or petitioner's family or household members. All attempts at service must be documented on a proof of service form and submitted to the court in a timely manner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If service cannot be completed within 10 calendar days, the law enforcement officer shall notify the petitioner. The petitioner shall provide information sufficient to permit notification. Law enforcement shall continue to attempt to complete service unless otherwise directed by the court. In the event that the petitioner does not provide a service address for the respondent or there is evidence that the respondent is evading service, the law enforcement officer shall use law enforcement databases to assist in locating the respondent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the respondent is in a protected person's presence at the time of contact for service, the law enforcement officer should take reasonable steps to separate the parties when possible prior to completing the service or inquiring about or collecting firearms. When the order requires the respondent to vacate the parties' shared residence, law enforcement shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the respondent has left the premises and is on notice that the respondent's return is a violation of the terms of the order. The law enforcement officer shall provide the respondent with copies of all forms with the exception of the confidential information form completed by the protected party and the proof of service form;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any law enforcement officer who serves a protection order on a respondent with the knowledge that the respondent requires special assistance due to a disability, brain injury, or impairment shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of the respondent to the extent practicable without compromise to the safety of the petitioner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of service must be submitted to the court on the proof of service form. The form must include the date and time of service and each document that was served in order for the service to be complete, along with any details such as conduct at the time of service, threats, or avoidance of service, as well as statements regarding possession of firearms, including any denials of ownership despite positive purchase history, active concealed pistol license, or sworn statements in the petition that allege the respondent's access to, or possession of, firearms; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If attempts at service were not successful, the proof of service form or the form letter showing that the order was not served, and stating the reason it was not served, must be returned to the court by the next judicial day following the last unsuccessful attempt at service. Each attempt at service must be noted and reflected in computer aided dispatch records, with the date, time, address, and reason service was not completed.</p>

<li>
<p>To help ensure familiarity with the unique nature of protection order proceedings, and an understanding of trauma-informed practices and best practices in the use of new technologies for remote hearings, judicial officers, including persons who serve as judicial officers pro tempore, should receive evidence-based training on procedural justice, trauma-informed practices, gender-based violence dynamics, coercive control, elder abuse, juvenile sex offending, teen dating violence, domestic violence homicide prevention, and requirements and best practices for the surrender of weapons before presiding over protection order hearings. Trainings should be provided on an ongoing basis as best practices, research on trauma, and legislation continue to evolve. As a method of continuous training, court commissioners, including pro tempore commissioners, shall be notified by the presiding judge or court administrator upon revision of any decision made under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated for this specific purpose, the administrative office of the courts shall develop training for judicial officers on the topics listed in subsection (1) of this section, which must be provided free of charge to judicial officers.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-203">Section 203 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-203">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the inherent volatility and danger associated with domestic violence, particularly when the court has made a finding that an ex parte order to surrender and prohibit weapons is necessary. The risk of domestic violence homicide is most acute when a victim is ending the relationship and throughout legal proceedings. The presence of a firearm in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of homicide by 11 times. The legislature acknowledges the potential for judicial or administrative error in hearings on full protection orders and the significant consequences that can result from such errors. In recognition of the potential for error, the legislature has previously established in RCW 2.24.050 that decisions of court commissioners are subject to revision and the courts have created processes for reconsideration of rulings. Therefore, in any proceeding in which the court enters a temporary protection order that includes a temporary order to surrender and prohibit weapons, and after the hearing the court denies the petition for a full protection order, the order to surrender and prohibit weapons must remain in effect until the period for a petitioner to file a motion for reconsideration or revision has passed. If a motion for reconsideration or revision is filed, the order to surrender and prohibit weapons must remain in effect until the motion for reconsideration or revision is resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the hearing in which the court denies the petition for a full protection order, if the petitioner is present, the court must notify the petitioner verbally of the procedures and timelines for filing a motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision. The court must provide the petitioner with written information explaining the procedures and timelines for filing a motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision. The information must also include contact information for civil legal aid organizations that may assist the petitioner with a motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsections (1) and (2) of this section do not apply if allowing the order to surrender and prohibit weapons to remain in effect would be manifestly unjust including, but not limited to, situations where the court finds the temporary protection order was entirely without merit, the petitioner was engaged in abusive use of litigation, or the petitioner was exerting coercive control, as defined in RCW 7.105.010, over the respondent.</p>

<li>
<p>All training relating to the handling of domestic violence complaints by law enforcement officers must stress enforcement of criminal laws in domestic situations, availability of community resources, and protection of the victim. Law enforcement agencies and community organizations with expertise in the issue of domestic violence shall cooperate in all aspects of such training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The criminal justice training commission shall implement by July 28, 2019, a course of instruction for the training of law enforcement officers in Washington in the handling of domestic violence complaints. The basic law enforcement curriculum of the criminal justice training commission must include at least twenty hours of basic training instruction on the law enforcement response to domestic violence. The course of instruction, the learning and performance objectives, and the standards for the training must be developed by the commission and focus on enforcing the criminal laws, safety of the victim, and holding the perpetrator accountable for the violence. The curriculum must include training on the extent and prevalence of domestic violence, the importance of criminal justice intervention, techniques for responding to incidents that minimize the likelihood of officer injury and that promote victim safety, investigation and interviewing skills, evidence gathering and report writing, assistance to and services for victims and children, verification and enforcement of court orders, liability, and any additional provisions that are necessary to carry out the intention of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The criminal justice training commission shall develop and update annually an in-service training program to familiarize law enforcement officers with domestic violence laws. The program must include techniques for handling incidents of domestic violence that minimize the likelihood of injury to the officer and that promote the safety of all parties. The commission shall make the training program available to all law enforcement agencies in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of the training in subsections (2) and (3) of this section must be conducted in conjunction with agencies having a primary responsibility for serving victims of domestic violence with emergency shelter and other services, and representatives to the statewide organization providing training and education to these organizations and to the general public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated for this specific purpose:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The curriculum required in subsection (2) of this section must include trauma-informed investigation and interviewing skills, domestic violence homicide prevention, the intersection of firearms and domestic violence, best practices for serving and enforcing protection orders, and assistance to and services for victims and children; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The in-service training program required in subsection (3) of this section must include training on domestic violence homicide prevention, the intersection of firearms and domestic violence, best practices for serving and enforcing protection orders, and assistance to and services for victims and children.</p>

<p>Because of the serious nature of domestic violence, the court in domestic violence actions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Shall not dismiss any charge or delay disposition because of concurrent dissolution or other civil proceedings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall not require proof that either party is seeking a dissolution of marriage prior to instigation of criminal proceedings;</p>

<li>
<p>Shall waive any requirement that the victim's location be disclosed to any person, other than the attorney of a criminal defendant, upon a showing that there is a possibility of further violence: PROVIDED, That the court may order a criminal defense attorney not to disclose to the attorney's client the victim's location; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shall identify by any reasonable means on docket sheets those criminal actions arising from acts of domestic violence; and</p>

<li>
<p>Because of the likelihood of repeated violence directed at those who have been victims of domestic violence in the past, when any person charged with or arrested for a crime involving domestic violence is released from custody before arraignment or trial on bail or personal recognizance, the court authorizing the release may prohibit that person from having any contact with the victim. The jurisdiction authorizing the release shall determine whether that person should be prohibited from having any contact with the victim. If there is no outstanding restraining or protection order prohibiting that person from having contact with the victim, the court authorizing release may issue, by telephone, a no-contact order prohibiting the person charged or arrested from having contact with the victim or from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In issuing the order, the court shall consider the provisions of RCW 9.41.800, and shall order the defendant to surrender, and prohibit the person from possessing, all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license as required in RCW 9.41.800.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The no-contact order shall also be issued in writing as soon as possible, and shall state that it may be extended as provided in subsection (3) of this section. By January 1, 2011, the administrative office of the courts shall develop a pattern form for all no-contact orders issued under this chapter.

The no-contact order shall terminate if the defendant is acquitted or the charges are dismissed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In issuing the order, the court shall consider all information documented in the incident report concerning the person's possession of and access to firearms and whether law enforcement took temporary custody of firearms at the time of the arrest. The court may as a condition of release prohibit the defendant from possessing or accessing firearms and order the defendant to immediately surrender all firearms and any concealed pistol license to a law enforcement agency upon release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a no-contact order is issued or extended, the court may also include in the conditions of release a requirement that the defendant submit to electronic monitoring as defined in RCW 9.94A.030. If electronic monitoring is ordered, the court shall specify who shall provide the monitoring services, and the terms under which the monitoring shall be performed. Upon conviction, the court may require as a condition of the sentence that the defendant pay the costs of the electronic monitoring. If a defendant enters into a deferred prosecution or stipulated order of continuance, the applicable order or agreement may require the defendant pay the costs of the electronic monitoring.</p>

<p>A law enforcement officer serving a protection order, no-contact order, or restraining order that includes an order to surrender all firearms, dangerous weapons, and a concealed pistol license under RCW 9.41.800 shall inform the respondent that the order is effective upon service and the respondent must immediately surrender all firearms and dangerous weapons in the respondent's custody, control, or possession and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW 9.41.070, and conduct any search permitted by law for such firearms, dangerous weapons, and concealed pistol license. The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license belonging to the respondent that are surrendered, in plain sight, or discovered pursuant to a lawful search. If the order is entered in open court and the respondent appears in person, the respondent shall be provided a copy and further service is not required.

<p>Upon the sworn statement or testimony of the petitioner or of any law enforcement officer alleging that the respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms or dangerous weapons as required by an order issued under RCW 9.41.800 or 10.99.100, the court shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms and dangerous weapons in their possession, custody, or control.

A compliance review hearing may be waived by the court or held at a later date if the information attested to by the person subject to the order, along with verification from law enforcement and any other relevant evidence, makes a sufficient showing that the person has timely and completely surrendered all firearms and dangerous weapons in the person's custody, control, or possession, and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW 9.41.070, to a law enforcement agency, and the court is able to make a finding of compliance. If the court does not have a sufficient record before it on which to make such a finding, the court must set a review hearing to occur as soon as possible and service by law enforcement shall be prioritized to minimize the time during which the respondent could access their firearms, dangerous weapons, or concealed pistol license. The respondent must be present and provide proof of compliance with the court's order. Courts shall make available forms that petitioners may complete and submit to the court in response to a respondent's declaration of whether the respondent has surrendered weapons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In making its findings regarding compliance, the court should also consider any available department of licensing and Washington state patrol firearm records; for criminal cases, the police report and any documentation of firearms, or their recovery pursuant to RCW 10.99.030(3)(a); and for civil protection order cases, the protection order narrative, any sections of the protection order petition that specifically reference or inquire about firearms and other dangerous weapons, any attachments to the protection order petition, any affidavits from law enforcement or the petitioner in response to a respondent's declaration regarding firearm surrender, or other relevant evidence regarding firearms, dangerous weapons, or a concealed pistol license in the person's custody, control, or possession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court is considering waiving or delaying the compliance review hearing, the petitioner, law enforcement, or the state or city attorney may request that the compliance hearing be held, if there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the respondent has not surrendered all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license, or is otherwise out of compliance with the court's order.</p>

<p>The act of voluntarily surrendering firearms or weapons,  providing testimony relating to the surrender of firearms or weapons, or complying with an order to surrender and prohibit weapons issued pursuant to RCW 9.41.800 or 10.99.100, and any information directly or indirectly derived from such act or testimony, may not be used against the person subject to the order in any criminal prosecution under this chapter, chapter 7.105 RCW, or RCW 9A.56.310, or in any criminal prosecution pursuant to which such order to surrender and prohibit weapons was issued, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order. Every such order issued subsequent to the effective date of this section shall contain language consistent with the statutory immunity set forth in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person subject to such an order invokes the privilege against self-incrimination at the time of issuance of the order or at a subsequent hearing, the court may afford the person subject to the order an opportunity to demonstrate that compliance with the surrender provision of the order would expose that person to a realistic threat of self-incrimination in a subsequent or pending criminal proceeding. The court may conduct this portion of the proceeding ex parte or receive evidence in camera, without the presence of the prosecuting attorney, after the court conducts an analysis under State v. Bone-Club, 128 wn.2d 254, and concludes that the courtroom may be closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the person subject to the order establishes such a realistic threat of self-incrimination regarding possible criminal prosecution that is not addressed by the immunity from prosecution set forth in (a) of this subsection, the court shall afford the relevant prosecuting attorney an opportunity to offer an immunity agreement tailored specifically to the firearms or weapons implicated by the potential self-incrimination. To achieve the purposes of this section, any immunity offered should be narrowly tailored to address any realistic threat of self-incrimination while ensuring that any other firearms not implicated are surrendered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any immunity from prosecution beyond the immunity set forth in (a) of this subsection, may only be extended by the prosecuting attorney. If the prosecuting attorney declines to extend immunity such that the person subject to the order cannot fully comply with its surrender provision without facing a realistic threat of self-incrimination, the court's order must provide for the surrender of every firearm, dangerous weapon, and concealed pistol license that does not implicate a realistic threat of self-incrimination. The order's prohibitions regarding accessing, purchasing, receiving, or attempting to purchase or receive, any firearms or other dangerous weapons, or concealed pistol license, remain in effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as diminishing the requirement that the person subject to the order fully comply with the order issued by the court. The burden remains on the person subject to the order to prove compliance.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>To provide relevant information to the court to determine compliance with the order, the court may allow the prosecuting attorney or city attorney to question the respondent regarding compliance.</p>

<li>
<p>All law enforcement agencies must have policies and procedures to provide for the acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, dangerous weapons, and concealed pistol licenses that a court requires must be surrendered under RCW 9.41.800. A law enforcement agency holding any firearm or concealed pistol license that has been surrendered under RCW 9.41.800 shall comply with the provisions of RCW 9.41.340 and 9.41.345 before the return of the firearm or concealed pistol license to the owner or individual from whom it was obtained.</p>

<p>The administrative office of the courts shall create a statewide pattern form to assist the courts in ensuring timely and complete compliance in a consistent manner with orders issued under this chapter. The administrative office of the courts shall report annually on the number of ex parte and full orders issued under this chapter by each court, and, if available, the type of protection order, no-contact order, restraining order, or criminal charge with which the order was issued, the duration of the order, the period of time from issuance of the order until the court's finding of compliance, any violations, the nature of the violations, any sanctions imposed, the number of firearms obtained pursuant to each order, whether subsequent orders were issued involving the same respondent, and may make recommendations regarding additional procedures, training, or data collection and reporting to enhance compliance and victim safety.</p>

<p>To prove full compliance with the court's order to surrender firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license under RCW 9.41.800 the person subject to the order must file with the clerk of the court : (a) A completed proof of surrender and receipt form ; (b) a declaration that the person has no firearms, dangerous weapons, or concealed pistol license; or (c) other evidence sufficient to establish full and timely compliance with the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The verification of compliance required in subsection (1) of this section must be provided to the court within 24 hours of service of the order, unless the order is pursuant to a criminal proceeding. In a criminal proceeding, if the person subject to the order is in custody, proof of compliance must be provided to the court before the person subject to the order is released from custody; otherwise, proof of compliance must be provided before the conclusion of the sentencing hearing. If the court finds that surrender of all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license is not possible prior to release or prior to the conclusion of the hearing, then arrangements for surrender shall be made and approved by the court before the person's release from custody or before the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, and the court shall order a law enforcement officer to accompany the person to the location where the firearms, dangerous weapons, and concealed pistol license are located so that they are surrendered directly to the law enforcement officer. Surrender to local law enforcement shall occur in a safe manner and proof of compliance provided by law enforcement to the court within 24 hours of either the person's release from custody or the conclusion of the sentencing hearing.</p>

<p>Upon the issuance of any extreme risk protection order under this chapter, including a temporary extreme risk protection order, the court shall:</p>

<p>Order the respondent to surrender to the local law enforcement agency all firearms in the respondent's custody, control, or possession, or subject to the respondent's immediate possession or control, and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW 9.41.070; and</p>

<p>The law enforcement officer serving any extreme risk protection order under this chapter, including a temporary extreme risk protection order, shall request that the respondent immediately surrender all firearms in the respondent's custody, control, or possession, and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW 9.41.070, and conduct any search permitted by law for such firearms. The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms belonging to the respondent that are surrendered, in plain sight, or discovered pursuant to a lawful search. If the order is entered in open court and the respondent appears in person, the respondent must be provided a copy and further service is not required. If the respondent refuses to accept a copy, an agent of the court may indicate on the record that the respondent refused to accept a copy of the order. If the respondent appears remotely for the hearing, or leaves the hearing before a final ruling is issued or order signed, and the court believes the respondent has sufficient notice such that additional service is not necessary, the order must recite that the respondent appeared before the court, has actual notice of the order, the necessity for further service is waived, and proof of service of the order is not necessary. The court shall enter the service and receipt into the record. A copy of the order and service must be transmitted immediately to law enforcement. The respondent must immediately surrender all firearms and any concealed pistol license, not previously surrendered, in a safe manner to the control of the local law enforcement agency on the day of the hearing at which the respondent was present in person or remotely. If the respondent is in custody, arrangements to recover the firearms must be made prior to release. Alternatively, if personal service by a law enforcement officer is not possible, and the respondent did not appear in person or remotely at the hearing, the respondent shall surrender the firearms in a safe manner to the control of the local law enforcement agency within 24 hours of being served with the order by alternate service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of a firearm or concealed pistol license shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms that have been surrendered and provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. Within 72 hours after service of the order, the officer serving the order shall file the original receipt with the court and shall ensure that the officer's law enforcement agency retains a copy of the receipt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the sworn statement or testimony of the petitioner or of any law enforcement officer alleging that the respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms as required by an order issued under this chapter, the court shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms in the respondent's possession, custody, or control. If probable cause for a violation of the order exists, the court shall issue a warrant describing the firearms and authorizing a search of the locations where the firearms are reasonably believed to be and the seizure of any firearms discovered pursuant to such search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person other than the respondent claims title to any firearms surrendered pursuant to this section, and that person is determined by the law enforcement agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm, the firearm must be returned to that person, provided that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The firearm is removed from the respondent's custody, control, or possession, and the lawful owner provides written verification to the court regarding how the lawful owner will safely store the firearm in a manner such that the respondent does not have access to, or control of, the firearm for the duration of the order;</p>

The compliance review hearing is not required upon a satisfactory showing on which the court can otherwise enter findings on the record that the respondent has timely and completely surrendered all firearms in the respondent's custody, control, or possession, and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW 9.41.070 to a law enforcement agency, and is in compliance with the order.
