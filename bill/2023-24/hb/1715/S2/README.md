# HB 1715 - Domestic violence

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1715-S2.pdf)

## Section 101
1. By January 1, 2025, the department must, through the contractor under subsection (2) of this section, establish the domestic violence lethality hotline to provide an evidence-based standard of practice to prevent intimate partner homicide, increase victim safety, prevent children from being exposed to violence and support children who have been exposed to violence, and enhance collaboration among law enforcement, domestic violence agencies, and service providers across the state.

2. The department must contract with an organization to operate the hotline. The department must select the organization through a competitive bidding process and ensure that the selected organization has demonstrated financial stability, meets the qualifications for the duties identified in this section, and does not have any conflicts of interest that would interfere with the duties identified in this section. The department may adopt rules for carrying out this section.

3. [Empty]

    a. The organization must develop or select a lethality assessment instrument and protocol to be used to determine the likelihood that a homicide will be committed by one intimate partner against another. The lethality determination may not be based exclusively on a numeric score, but must be based on a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the professional determination of the person conducting the assessment. All lethality assessments must be rooted in evidence-based risk factors for domestic homicide. The lethality assessment instrument and protocol must be empirically validated and reassessed at regular intervals to ensure its accuracy and that the results are not racially biased.

    b. Beginning July 1, 2025, the hotline must provide on-call service for completing lethality assessments remotely through victim interviews facilitated by peace officers under RCW 10.99.030 and for petitioners in domestic violence protection order proceedings. The hotline must also assist victims with confidential immediate safety planning and referrals for children exposed to violence. Upon completing a lethality assessment, the hotline must transmit a copy of the assessment to the applicable local law enforcement agency or court unless the victim objects to such transmission. Services under this subsection must be offered statewide, on-demand, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

    c. The organization must establish policies and procedures for conducting lethality assessments, and develop and provide training to peace officers on best practices for coordinating with the hotline, as required under RCW 10.99.030.

    d. Recognizing that past history of domestic violence is a significant lethality factor, law enforcement agencies and the courts must provide the hotline access to criminal history records and court records to the extent necessary for the hotline to perform lethality assessments under this section.

4. [Empty]

    a. The organization must implement a mechanism to place a high lethality designation in law enforcement and court databases if a respondent or defendant is determined to be at high risk of intimate partner homicide under this section, including the Washington state patrol's electronic database accessible to law enforcement agencies and officers, including federally recognized Indian tribes, that have a connection to the Washington state patrol database.

    b. The administrative office of the courts shall develop a standard form to submit the designation to the courts.

5. The organization shall, in consultation with stakeholders, determine appropriate training requirements for individuals conducting lethality assessments. The training must be competency-based, include a practical application, and include material on domestic violence, domestic violence homicide prevention, and trauma-informed interviewing.

6. After the lethality assessment is complete, the hotline must provide the victim with immediate safety planning based on the assessment. The hotline staff conducting the lethality assessment may not be the same staff assisting the victim with immediate safety planning. The hotline staff responsible for immediate safety planning must inform the victim of the following:

    a. The level of danger based on the assessment;

    b. That the victim has the right to object to the lethality assessment being shared with law enforcement or the courts and the potential safety implications based on that decision;

    c. If the victim chooses to share the assessment with the courts and law enforcement, the individuals and entities with whom the assessment will be shared, how it will be used in court, safety measures that may be ordered as a result of the assessment, and the extent to which the assessment will be shared with the subject of the assessment;

    d. If the victim does not choose to share the assessment with the courts and law enforcement, that the victim has the right to make a different decision at a later time and how to exercise that change of decision;

    e. That the assessment is exempt from public disclosure; and

    f. That the assessment is confidential unless the victim chooses to share it and that safety planning is confidential under all circumstances.

7. After conducting immediate safety planning, the hotline must refer the victim to a local community-based domestic violence agency for follow-up. When practicable, the referral must be conducted in a manner that directly connects the victim to the agency in real time, as opposed to only providing contact information.

8. The hotline shall provide, upon request, a copy of the lethality assessment to a prosecutor or an attorney representing the subject of the assessment.

9. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Department" means the department of social and health services; and

    b. "Hotline" means the domestic violence lethality hotline.

## Section 102
1. The administrative office of the courts must develop a model form for courts to use when granting protection orders or no-contact orders when the respondent or defendant has a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act. The form must include all mandatory conditions for protection orders or no-contact orders with a high lethality designation.

2. The administrative office of the courts must adopt rules requiring courts to rapidly transmit protection orders and no-contact orders with a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act to the department of licensing.

## Section 103
1. Conviction records may be disseminated without restriction.

2. Any criminal history record information which pertains to an incident that occurred within the last twelve months for which a person is currently being processed by the criminal justice system, including the entire period of correctional supervision extending through final discharge from parole, when applicable, may be disseminated without restriction.

3. Criminal history record information which includes nonconviction data may be disseminated by a criminal justice agency to another criminal justice agency for any purpose associated with the administration of criminal justice, or in connection with the employment of the subject of the record by a criminal justice or juvenile justice agency, except as provided under RCW 13.50.260. A criminal justice agency may respond to any inquiry from another criminal justice agency without any obligation to ascertain the purpose for which the information is to be used by the agency making the inquiry.

4. Criminal history record information which includes nonconviction data may be disseminated by a criminal justice agency to implement a statute, ordinance, executive order, or a court rule, decision, or order which expressly refers to records of arrest, charges, or allegations of criminal conduct or other nonconviction data and authorizes or directs that it be available or accessible for a specific purpose.

5. Criminal history record information which includes nonconviction data may be disseminated to individuals and agencies pursuant to a contract with a criminal justice agency to provide services related to the administration of criminal justice. Such contract must specifically authorize access to criminal history record information, but need not specifically state that access to nonconviction data is included. The agreement must limit the use of the criminal history record information to stated purposes and insure the confidentiality and security of the information consistent with state law and any applicable federal statutes and regulations.

6. Criminal history record information which includes nonconviction data may be disseminated to individuals and agencies for the express purpose of research, evaluative, or statistical activities pursuant to an agreement with a criminal justice agency. Such agreement must authorize the access to nonconviction data, limit the use of that information which identifies specific individuals to research, evaluative, or statistical purposes, and contain provisions giving notice to the person or organization to which the records are disseminated that the use of information obtained therefrom and further dissemination of such information are subject to the provisions of this chapter and applicable federal statutes and regulations, which shall be cited with express reference to the penalties provided for a violation thereof.

7. Criminal history record information that includes nonconviction data may be disseminated to the domestic violence lethality hotline to the extent necessary for the hotline to perform lethality assessments under section 101 of this act.

8. Every criminal justice agency that maintains and disseminates criminal history record information must maintain information pertaining to every dissemination of criminal history record information except a dissemination to the effect that the agency has no record concerning an individual. Information pertaining to disseminations shall include:

    a. An indication of to whom (agency or person) criminal history record information was disseminated;

    b. The date on which the information was disseminated;

    c. The individual to whom the information relates; and

    d. A brief description of the information disseminated.

The information pertaining to dissemination required to be maintained shall be retained for a period of not less than one year.

9. In addition to the other provisions in this section allowing dissemination of criminal history record information, RCW 4.24.550 governs dissemination of information concerning offenders who commit sex offenses as defined by RCW 9.94A.030. Criminal justice agencies, their employees, and officials shall be immune from civil liability for dissemination on criminal history record information concerning sex offenders as provided in RCW 4.24.550.

## Section 104
The judicial officer in any felony, misdemeanor, or gross misdemeanor case must, in determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community, take into account the available information concerning:

1. The nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence;

2. The weight of the evidence against the defendant;

    b. Any evidence that the purpose of the alleged offense was to gain or maintain power and control over the victim as part of a broader pattern of intimate terrorism.

## Section 105
The following investigative, law enforcement, and crime victim information is exempt from public inspection and copying under this chapter:

## Section 301
1. The office of civil legal aid shall propose a plan to standardize and expand statewide access to civil legal assistance for survivors of domestic violence as defined in RCW 7.105.010 in protection order proceedings initiated in superior and district courts. The plan must include the following specific areas of focus:

    a. Exploration of how deployment of publicly funded attorneys could integrate with existing networks of community and nonprofit organizations already providing support for domestic violence survivors;

    b. Strategies for expanding the number of private attorneys available to provide effective civil legal representation to domestic violence survivors;

    c. Strategies for incorporating high quality, culturally responsive, equity and trauma-informed assistance by nonattorneys into delivery systems where appropriate;

    d. A proposed implementation schedule and priorities;

    g. Any other information deemed appropriate by the office of civil legal aid.

2. The office of civil legal aid must report the plan to the appropriate legislative committees by September 30, 2024.

3. This section expires December 31, 2024.

## Section 302
The legislature recognizes the importance of connecting domestic violence survivors with civil legal counsel. To support this effort for survivors seeking private attorneys for representation, the office of civil legal aid shall contract with a statewide domestic violence survivor advocacy organization to maintain on its website a statewide list of attorneys who represent survivors of domestic violence in protection order proceedings. The list of attorneys must be organized by region of the state and include contact information for the attorneys. An initial list shall be posted by July 1, 2024, and be regularly updated thereafter.

## Section 303
The legislature recognizes that many tribes exercise tribal court civil jurisdiction in domestic violence matters. While principles of tribal sovereignty and commitments made in the centennial accord prohibit the state of Washington from directing tribal court practices or directing that counsel be appointed in tribal court civil protection proceedings, and while the provisions of chapter 7.105 RCW do not apply in tribal courts, it is necessary that indigenous survivors of domestic violence have access to high quality legal assistance in tribal court domestic violence protection proceedings consistent with applicable tribal court rules and practices. To this end, and subject to appropriations for this purpose, the office of civil legal aid must develop a program and implementation plan to provide indigenous-informed, culturally competent legal support for survivors in tribal court domestic violence protection proceedings. The office of civil legal aid must establish a tribal advisory council to inform and guide the development of this program. Initial operation of the tribal court civil protection proceedings program must commence by January 1, 2025.

## Section 304
1. The legislature hereby respectfully requests the Washington supreme court's gender and justice commission to convene a work group of interested collaborators and professional experts to establish minimum practice and training standards for attorneys representing survivors of domestic violence in protection orders under chapter 7.105 RCW. The work group is also requested to review currently available training for nonlawyers assisting survivors in proceedings under chapter 7.105 RCW and to suggest improvements, additions, and appropriate practice standards. The commission is requested to adopt and forward final standards to the appropriate legislative committees by November 30, 2024.

2. Subject to funds appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of civil legal aid shall provide staff support to the work group.

3. This section expires January 1, 2025.

## Section 401
When service is to be completed under this chapter by a law enforcement officer:

1. The clerk of the court shall have a copy of any order issued under this chapter, the confidential information form, as well as the petition for a protection order and any supporting materials, electronically forwarded on the same judicial day to the law enforcement agency in the county or municipality where the respondent resides, as specified in the order, for service upon the respondent. If the respondent has moved from that county or municipality and personal service is not required, the law enforcement agency specified in the order may serve the order;

2. Service of an order issued under this chapter must take precedence over the service of other documents by law enforcement unless they are of a similar emergency nature;

3. Where personal service is required, the first attempt at service must occur within 24 hours of receiving the order from the court unless an emergency situation renders the service infeasible. The law enforcement officer must give priority to orders with a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act. If the first attempt is not successful, no fewer than two additional attempts should be made to serve the order, particularly for respondents who present heightened risk of lethality or other risk of physical harm to the petitioner or petitioner's family or household members. All attempts at service must be documented on a proof of service form and submitted to the court in a timely manner;

4. The law enforcement officer serving an order under this section must attempt to contact the petitioner before the attempted service so that the petitioner may provide pertinent information related to officer safety considerations, the respondent's behavior, the location and description of the respondent's firearms, and other relevant details;

5. If service cannot be completed within 10 calendar days, the law enforcement officer shall notify the petitioner. The petitioner shall provide information sufficient to permit notification. Law enforcement shall continue to attempt to complete service unless otherwise directed by the court. In the event that the petitioner does not provide a service address for the respondent or there is evidence that the respondent is evading service, the law enforcement officer shall use law enforcement databases to assist in locating the respondent;

6. If the respondent is in a protected person's presence at the time of contact for service, the law enforcement officer should take reasonable steps to separate the parties when possible prior to completing the service or inquiring about or collecting firearms. When the order requires the respondent to vacate the parties' shared residence, law enforcement shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the respondent has left the premises and is on notice that the respondent's return is a violation of the terms of the order. The law enforcement officer shall provide the respondent with copies of all forms with the exception of the confidential information form completed by the protected party and the proof of service form;

7. Any law enforcement officer who serves a protection order on a respondent with the knowledge that the respondent requires special assistance due to a disability, brain injury, or impairment shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of the respondent to the extent practicable without compromise to the safety of the petitioner;

8. Proof of service must be submitted to the court on the proof of service form. The form must include the date and time of service and each document that was served in order for the service to be complete, along with any details such as conduct at the time of service, threats, or avoidance of service, as well as statements regarding possession of firearms, including any denials of ownership despite positive purchase history, active concealed pistol license, or sworn statements in the petition that allege the respondent's access to, or possession of, firearms;

9. Upon service of the order, the law enforcement officer must contact the petitioner to communicate that the order has been served, is now in effect, and can be lawfully enforced.

## Section 402
1. To help ensure familiarity with the unique nature of protection order proceedings, and an understanding of trauma-informed practices and best practices in the use of new technologies for remote hearings, judicial officers, including persons who serve as judicial officers pro tempore, should receive evidence-based training on procedural justice, trauma-informed practices, gender-based violence dynamics, coercive control, elder abuse, juvenile sex offending, teen dating violence, domestic violence homicide prevention, and requirements and best practices for the surrender of weapons before presiding over protection order hearings. Trainings should be provided on an ongoing basis as best practices, research on trauma, and legislation continue to evolve. As a method of continuous training, court commissioners, including pro tempore commissioners, shall be notified by the presiding judge or court administrator upon revision of any decision made under this chapter.

2. The administrative office of the courts, in consultation with the supreme court gender and justice commission, should ensure the training required under this section is regularly provided and available remotely and notify judicial officers of the training.

## Section 403

## Section 404
1. [Empty]

    a. Whenever a domestic violence protection order, a sexual assault protection order, a stalking protection order, or a vulnerable adult protection order is granted under this chapter, or an order is granted under chapter 9A.40, 9A.44, 9A.46, 9A.88, 9.94A, 10.99, 26.09, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW, or there is a valid foreign protection order as defined in RCW 26.52.020, or there is a Canadian domestic violence protection order as defined in RCW 26.55.010, and the respondent or person to be restrained knows of the order, a violation of any of the following provisions of the order is a gross misdemeanor, except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section:

        i. The restraint provisions prohibiting acts or threats of violence against, or stalking of, a protected party, or the restraint provisions prohibiting contact with a protected party;

        ii. A provision excluding the person from a residence, workplace, school, or day care;

        iii. A provision prohibiting the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location, a protected party's person, or a protected party's vehicle;

        iv. A provision prohibiting interfering with the protected party's efforts to remove a pet owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by the petitioner, the respondent, or a minor child residing with either the petitioner or the respondent;

    v. A provision requiring the respondent to submit to electronic monitoring; or

    vi. A provision of a foreign protection order or a Canadian domestic violence protection order specifically indicating that a violation will be a crime.

    b. Upon conviction, and in addition to any other penalties provided by law, the court:

        i. May require that the respondent submit to electronic monitoring. The court shall specify who must provide the electronic monitoring services and the terms under which the monitoring must be performed. The order also may include a requirement that the respondent pay the costs of the monitoring. The court shall consider the ability of the convicted person to pay for electronic monitoring; and

        ii. Shall impose a fine of $15, in addition to any penalty or fine imposed, for a violation of a domestic violence protection order issued under this chapter. Revenue from the $15 fine must be remitted monthly to the state treasury for deposit in the domestic violence prevention account.

2. A law enforcement officer shall arrest without a warrant and keep in custody until release by a judicial officer on bail, personal recognizance, or court order, a person whom the law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe has violated a domestic violence protection order, a sexual assault protection order, a stalking protection order, or a vulnerable adult protection order, or an order issued under chapter 9A.40, 9A.44, 9A.46, 9A.88, 9.94A, 10.99, 26.09, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW, or a valid foreign protection order as defined in RCW 26.52.020, or a Canadian domestic violence protection order as defined in RCW 26.55.010, that restrains the person or excludes the person from a residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibits the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location, a protected party's person, or a protected party's vehicle, if the person restrained knows of the order. Presence of the order in the law enforcement computer-based criminal intelligence information system is not the only means of establishing knowledge of the order. A law enforcement officer is not required to keep in custody a person under this subsection if the person requires immediate medical attention and is admitted to a hospital.

3. A violation of a domestic violence protection order, a sexual assault protection order, a stalking protection order, or a vulnerable adult protection order, or an order issued under chapter 9A.40, 9A.44, 9A.46, 9A.88, 9.94A, 10.99, 26.09, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW, or a valid foreign protection order as defined in RCW 26.52.020, or a Canadian domestic violence protection order as defined in RCW 26.55.010, shall also constitute contempt of court, and is subject to the penalties prescribed by law.

6. [Empty]

    a. A defendant arrested for violating a domestic violence protection order, sexual assault protection order, stalking protection order, or vulnerable adult protection order, or an order granted under chapter 9A.40, 9A.44, 9A.46, 9A.88, 9.94A, 10.99, 26.09, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW, or a valid foreign protection order as defined in RCW 26.52.020, or a Canadian domestic violence protection order as defined in RCW 26.55.010, is required to appear in person before a magistrate within one judicial day after the arrest. At the time of the appearance, the court shall determine the necessity of imposing a no-contact order or other conditions of pretrial release.

    b. A defendant who is charged by citation, complaint, or information with violating any protection order identified in (a) of this subsection and not arrested shall appear in court for arraignment in person as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 14 days after the next day on which court is in session following the issuance of the citation or the filing of the complaint or information.

7. Upon the filing of an affidavit by the petitioner or any law enforcement officer alleging that the respondent has violated a domestic violence protection order, a sexual assault protection order, a stalking protection order, or a vulnerable adult protection order, or an order granted under chapter 9A.40, 9A.44, 9A.46, 9A.88, 9.94A, 10.99, 26.09, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW, or a valid foreign protection order as defined in RCW 26.52.020, or a Canadian domestic violence protection order as defined in RCW 26.55.010, the court may issue an order to the respondent, requiring the respondent to appear and show cause within 14 days as to why the respondent should not be found in contempt of court and punished accordingly. The hearing may be held in the court of any county or municipality in which the petitioner or respondent temporarily or permanently resides at the time of the alleged violation.

8. Appearances required under this section are mandatory and cannot be waived.

## Section 405
This section applies to modification or termination of domestic violence protection orders, sexual assault protection orders, stalking protection orders, and antiharassment protection orders.

1. Upon a motion with notice to all parties and after a hearing, the court may modify the terms of an existing protection order or terminate an existing order.

2. A respondent's motion to modify or terminate an existing protection order must include a declaration setting forth facts supporting the requested order for modification or termination. The nonmoving parties to the proceeding may file opposing declarations. All motions to modify or terminate shall be based on the written materials and evidence submitted to the court. The court shall set a hearing only if the court finds that adequate cause is established. If the court finds that the respondent established adequate cause, the court shall set a date for hearing the respondent's motion, which must be at least 14 days from the date the court finds adequate cause.

3. Upon the motion of a respondent, the court may not modify or terminate an existing protection order unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a substantial change in circumstances such that the respondent will not resume, engage in, or attempt to engage in, the following acts against the petitioner or those persons protected by the protection order if the order is terminated or modified:

    a. Acts of domestic violence, in cases involving domestic violence protection orders;

    b. Physical or nonphysical contact, in cases involving sexual assault protection orders;

    c. Acts of stalking, in cases involving stalking protection orders; or

    d. Acts of unlawful harassment, in cases involving antiharassment protection orders.

The petitioner bears no burden of proving that the petitioner has a current reasonable fear of harm by the respondent.

4. In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may consider the following unweighted factors, and no inference is to be drawn from the order in which the factors are listed:

    a. Whether the respondent has committed or threatened sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, or other harmful acts against the petitioner or any other person since the protection order was entered;

    b. Whether the respondent has violated the terms of the protection order and the time that has passed since the entry of the order;

    c. Whether the respondent has exhibited suicidal ideation or attempts since the protection order was entered;

    d. Whether the respondent has been convicted of criminal activity since the protection order was entered;

    e. Whether the respondent has either acknowledged responsibility for acts of sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, or behavior that resulted in the entry of the protection order, or successfully completed state-certified perpetrator treatment or counseling since the protection order was entered;

    f. Whether the respondent has a continuing involvement with drug or alcohol abuse, if such abuse was a factor in the protection order;

    g. Whether the petitioner consents to terminating the protection order, provided that consent is given voluntarily and knowingly; or

    h. Other factors relating to a substantial change in circumstances.

5. In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may not base its determination on the fact that time has passed without a violation of the order.

6. Regardless of whether there is a substantial change in circumstances, the court may decline to terminate a protection order if it finds that the acts of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, unlawful harassment, and other harmful acts that resulted in the issuance of the protection order were of such severity that the order should not be terminated.

7. A respondent may file a motion to modify or terminate an order no more than once in every 12-month period that the order is in effect, starting from the date of the order and continuing through any renewal period.

8. If a person who is protected by a protection order has a child or adopts a child after a protection order has been issued, but before the protection order has expired, the petitioner may seek to include the new child in the order of protection on an ex parte basis if the child is already in the physical custody of the petitioner. If the restrained person is the legal or biological parent of the child, a hearing must be set and notice given to the restrained person prior to final modification of the full protection order.

9. (a)(i) Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, a court must require the respondent to pay the petitioner for costs incurred in responding to a motion to modify or terminate a domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking protection order, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

        ii. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that an order to pay costs would be manifestly unjust or that the respondent is currently unable to pay the costs and is unlikely to be able to pay the costs in the future, the court may set the costs at a lower amount, enter into a payment plan with the respondent, or decline to order payment of the costs.

    b. A court may require the respondent to pay the petitioner for costs incurred in responding to a motion to modify or terminate any other type of protection order, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

## Section 406
1. Because of the potential for error in protection order proceedings and the danger associated with firearm access in domestic violence situations, in any proceeding in which the court enters a temporary protection order that includes a temporary order to surrender and prohibit weapons, and after the hearing the court denies the petition for a full protection order, the order to surrender and prohibit weapons must remain in effect for 10 calendar days after the court's denial of the petition for a full protection order to provide the petitioner the opportunity to file a motion for reconsideration or revision. If a motion for reconsideration or revision is filed within 10 calendar days, the order to surrender and prohibit weapons must remain in effect until the motion for reconsideration or revision is resolved.

2. The court must notify the petitioner verbally and provide the petitioner with written information at the hearing in which the court denies the petition for a full protection order explaining the procedures and timelines for filing a motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision. The information must also include contact information for civil legal aid organizations that may assist the petitioner with a motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision.

3. A motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision must be filed within 10 calendar days of the court's denial of the petition for a full protection order. The petitioner may not file both a motion for reconsideration and a motion for revision. The hearing on the motion must be held within 30 calendar days from the filing of the motion.

4. Subsection (1) of this section does not apply if allowing the order to surrender and prohibit weapons would be manifestly unjust including, but not limited to, situations where the court finds the temporary protection order was entirely without merit, the petitioner was engaged in abusive use of litigation, or the petitioner was exerting coercive control, as defined in RCW 7.105.010, over the respondent.

## Section 407
1. A victim of domestic violence may maintain, as plaintiff, an action against the perpetrator of the domestic violence if the victim was the intimate partner of the perpetrator.

2. For purposes of an action maintained under this section, damages may include any damages proximately caused by the domestic violence including, but not limited to, emotional distress, health care costs, lost wages, property damage, and attorneys' fees incurred in order to obtain a protection order or no-contact order against the perpetrator. A plaintiff who prevails under this section is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in order to bring an action under this section.

3. For the purposes of this section, "domestic violence" and "intimate partner" have the meanings provided in RCW 7.105.010.

## Section 408
The following actions shall be commenced within six years:

1. An action upon a contract in writing, or liability express or implied arising out of a written agreement, except as provided for in RCW 64.04.007(2).

2. An action upon an account receivable. For purposes of this section, an account receivable is any obligation for payment incurred in the ordinary course of the claimant's business or profession, whether arising from one or more transactions and whether or not earned by performance.

3. An action for the rents and profits or for the use and occupation of real estate.

4. An action under section 407 of this act. For purposes of this subsection, the six-year period begins to run upon the termination of the domestic violence relationship.

## Section 504
1. Because of the serious nature of domestic violence, the court in domestic violence actions:

    a. Shall not dismiss any charge or delay disposition because of concurrent dissolution or other civil proceedings;

    b. Shall not require proof that either party is seeking a dissolution of marriage prior to instigation of criminal proceedings;

    c. Shall waive any requirement that the victim's location be disclosed to any person upon a showing that there is a possibility of further violence;

    d. Shall identify by any reasonable means on docket sheets those criminal actions arising from acts of domestic violence; and

    e. Shall not deny issuance of a no-contact order based on the existence of an applicable civil protection order preventing the defendant from contacting the victim.

2. [Empty]

    a. Because of the likelihood of repeated violence directed at those who have been victims of domestic violence in the past, when any person charged with or arrested for a crime involving domestic violence is released from custody before arraignment or trial on bail or personal recognizance, the court authorizing the release may prohibit that person from having any contact with the victim. The jurisdiction authorizing the release shall determine whether that person should be prohibited from having any contact with the victim. If there is no outstanding restraining or protective order prohibiting that person from having contact with the victim, the court authorizing release may issue, by telephone, a no-contact order prohibiting the person charged or arrested from having contact with the victim or from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location.

    b. In issuing the order, the court shall consider the provisions of RCW 9.41.800, and shall order the defendant to surrender, and prohibit the person from possessing, all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license as required in RCW 9.41.800.

    c. The no-contact order shall also be issued in writing as soon as possible, and shall state that it may be extended as provided in subsection (3) of this section. By January 1, 2011, the administrative office of the courts shall develop a pattern form for all no-contact orders issued under this chapter. A no-contact order issued under this chapter must substantially comply with the pattern form developed by the administrative office of the courts.

3. [Empty]

    a. At the time of arraignment the court shall determine whether a no-contact order shall be issued or extended. So long as the court finds probable cause, the court may issue or extend a no-contact order even if the defendant fails to appear at arraignment. The no-contact order shall terminate if the defendant is acquitted or the charges are dismissed.

    b. [Empty]

        i. In issuing the order, the court shall consider any available lethality assessment and all information documented in the incident report concerning the person's possession of and access to firearms and whether law enforcement took temporary custody of firearms at the time of the arrest.

        ii. The court may as a condition of release prohibit the defendant from possessing or accessing firearms and order the defendant to immediately surrender all firearms and any concealed pistol license to a law enforcement agency upon release.

        iii. In cases with a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act, if the court does not prohibit the defendant from possessing or accessing firearms and order the defendant to immediately surrender all firearms and any concealed pistol license to a law enforcement agency before release, the court shall indicate in writing its reasons for not doing so. Nothing in this subsection (3)(b)(iii) affects the court's discretion under (b)(ii) of this subsection.

    c. [Empty]

        i. If a no-contact order is issued or extended, the court may also include in the conditions of release a requirement that the defendant submit to electronic monitoring as defined in RCW 9.94A.030. If electronic monitoring is ordered, the court shall specify who shall provide the monitoring services, and the terms under which the monitoring shall be performed. Upon conviction, the court may require as a condition of the sentence that the defendant pay the costs of the electronic monitoring. If a defendant enters into a deferred prosecution or stipulated order of continuance, the applicable order or agreement may require the defendant pay the costs of the electronic monitoring.

        ii. Beginning July 1, 2025, in cases where the victim was the defendant's intimate partner and the defendant has a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act, if the court does not order the defendant to submit to electronic monitoring with victim notification technology, it shall indicate in writing its reasons for not doing so. Nothing in this subsection affects the court's discretion to order the defendant to submit to electronic monitoring with victim notification technology in any other circumstances.

4. [Empty]

    a. Willful violation of a court order issued under subsection (2), (3), or (7) of this section is punishable under RCW 7.105.450.

    b. The written order releasing the person charged or arrested shall contain the court's directives and shall bear the legend: "Violation of this order is a criminal offense under chapter 7.105 RCW and will subject a violator to arrest; any assault, drive-by shooting, or reckless endangerment that is a violation of this order is a felony. You can be arrested even if any person protected by the order invites or allows you to violate the order's prohibitions. You have the sole responsibility to avoid or refrain from violating the order's provisions. Only the court can change the order."

    c. A certified copy of the order shall be provided to the victim.

5. If a no-contact order has been issued prior to charging, that order shall expire at arraignment or within seventy-two hours if charges are not filed.

6. Whenever a no-contact order is issued, modified, or terminated under subsection (2) or (3) of this section, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order on or before the next judicial day to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order.

## Section 604
1. Because of the heightened risk of lethality to petitioners when respondents to protection orders become aware of court involvement and continue to have access to firearms, and the frequency of noncompliance with court orders prohibiting possession of firearms, law enforcement and judicial processes must emphasize swift and certain compliance with court orders prohibiting access, possession, and ownership of all firearms.

        i. Because of the heightened risk of serious violence after arrest for a crime of domestic violence, when there is a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act and the court has probable cause to believe that a person serving a term of confinement for an offense requiring the surrender of firearms or other dangerous weapons continues to possess such firearms or dangerous weapons, if the court does not order a law enforcement officer to accompany the person to the location where the court has probable cause to believe the firearms or dangerous weapons are stored, it shall indicate in writing its reasons for not doing so. Nothing in this subsection affects the court's discretion to enter such an order in any other circumstances.

        ii. If a court does order a law enforcement officer to accompany the person to the location where the court has probable cause to believe the firearms or dangerous weapons are stored, the law enforcement officer must immediately take possession of any firearms or dangerous weapons the officer finds at the location.

3.

If probable cause exists that a crime occurred, the court shall issue a warrant describing the firearms or dangerous weapons and authorizing a search of the locations where the firearms and dangerous weapons are reasonably believed to be and the seizure of all firearms and dangerous weapons discovered pursuant to such search.

5. If a person other than the respondent claims title to any firearms or dangerous weapons surrendered pursuant to this section, and the person is determined by the law enforcement agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm or dangerous weapon, the firearm or dangerous weapon shall be returned to the lawful owner, provided that:

    a. The firearm or dangerous weapon is removed from the respondent's access, custody, control, or possession and the lawful owner agrees by written document signed under penalty of perjury to store the firearm or dangerous weapon in a manner such that the respondent does not have access to or control of the firearm or dangerous weapon;

    b. The firearm or dangerous weapon is not otherwise unlawfully possessed by the owner; and

    c. The requirements of RCW 9.41.345 are met.

6. Courts shall develop procedures to verify timely and complete compliance with orders to surrender and prohibit weapons under RCW 9.41.800 or 10.99.100, including compliance review hearings to be held as soon as possible upon receipt from law enforcement of proof of service. The court must set a review hearing to occur as soon as possible at which the respondent must be present and provide proof of compliance with the court's order. Courts shall make available forms that petitioners may complete and submit to the court in response to a respondent's declaration of whether the respondent has surrendered weapons.

7. [Empty]

    a. If a court finds at the compliance review hearing, or any other hearing where compliance with the order to surrender and prohibit weapons is addressed, that there is probable cause to believe the respondent was aware of and failed to fully comply with the order, failed to appear at the compliance review hearing, or violated the order after the court entered findings of compliance, pursuant to its authority under chapter 7.21 RCW, the court must issue an arrest warrant and initiate a contempt proceeding to impose remedial sanctions on its own motion, or upon the motion of the prosecutor, city attorney, or the petitioner's counsel, and issue an order requiring the respondent to appear, provide proof of compliance with the order, and show cause why the respondent should not be held in contempt of court.

    b. If the respondent is not present in court at the compliance review hearing or if the court issues an order to appear and show cause after a compliance review hearing, the clerk of the court shall electronically transmit a copy of the order to show cause to the law enforcement agency where the respondent resides for personal service or service in the manner provided in the civil rules of superior court or applicable statute. Law enforcement shall also serve a copy of the order to show cause on the petitioner, either electronically or in person, at no cost.

    c. The order to show cause served upon the respondent shall state the date, time, and location of the hearing and shall include a warning that the respondent may be held in contempt of court if the respondent fails to promptly comply with the terms of the order to surrender and prohibit weapons and a warning that an arrest warrant could be issued if the respondent fails to appear on the date and time provided in the order.

The court shall also provide sufficient notice to the law enforcement agency of the hearing. Upon receiving notice pursuant to this subsection, a law enforcement agency must:

(A) Provide the court with a complete list of firearms and other dangerous weapons surrendered by the respondent or otherwise belonging to the respondent that are in the possession of the law enforcement agency; and

(B) Provide the court with verification that any concealed pistol license issued to the respondent has been surrendered and the agency with authority to revoke the license has been notified.

        iii. If the law enforcement agency has a reasonable suspicion that the respondent is not in full compliance with the terms of the order, the law enforcement agency must submit the basis for its belief to the court, and may do so through the filing of a declaration.

    e. If the court finds the respondent in contempt, the court may impose remedial sanctions designed to ensure swift compliance with the order to surrender and prohibit weapons.

    f. The court may order a respondent found in contempt of the order to surrender and prohibit weapons to pay for any losses incurred by a party in connection with the contempt proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees, service fees, and other costs. The costs of the proceeding shall not be borne by the petitioner.

8. [Empty]

    a. To help ensure that accurate and comprehensive information about firearms compliance is provided to judicial officers, a representative from either the prosecuting attorney's office or city attorney's office, or both, from the relevant jurisdiction may appear and be heard or submit written information at any hearing that concerns compliance with an order to surrender and prohibit weapons issued in connection with another type of protection order.

    b. Either the prosecuting attorney's office or city attorney's office, or both, from the relevant jurisdiction may designate an advocate or a staff person from their office who is not an attorney to appear on behalf of their office. Such appearance does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.

9. [Empty]

    a. An order to surrender and prohibit weapons issued pursuant to RCW 9.41.800 must state that the act of voluntarily surrendering firearms or weapons, or providing testimony relating to the surrender of firearms or weapons, pursuant to such an order, may not be used against the respondent in any criminal prosecution under this chapter, chapter 7.105 RCW, or RCW 9A.56.310.

    b. To provide relevant information to the court to determine compliance with the order, the court may allow the prosecuting attorney or city attorney to question the respondent regarding compliance.

10. All law enforcement agencies must have policies and procedures to provide for the acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, dangerous weapons, and concealed pistol licenses that a court requires must be surrendered under RCW 9.41.800. A law enforcement agency holding any firearm or concealed pistol license that has been surrendered under RCW 9.41.800 shall comply with the provisions of RCW 9.41.340 and 9.41.345 before the return of the firearm or concealed pistol license to the owner or individual from whom it was obtained.

    b. If the respondent is not present in court at the compliance review hearing or if the court issues an order to appear and show cause after a compliance review hearing, the clerk of the court shall electronically transmit a copy of the order to show cause to the law enforcement agency where the respondent resides for personal service or service in the manner provided in the civil rules of superior court or applicable statute.

    c. The order to show cause served upon the respondent shall state the date, time, and location of the hearing, and shall include a warning that the respondent may be held in contempt of court if the respondent fails to promptly comply with the terms of the extreme risk protection order and a warning that an arrest warrant could be issued if the respondent fails to appear on the date and time provided in the order to show cause.

(B) Provide the court with verification that any concealed pistol license issued to the respondent has been surrendered and that a law enforcement agency with authority to revoke the license has been notified.

        iii. If the law enforcement agency has a reasonable suspicion that the respondent is not in full compliance with the terms of the order, the law enforcement agency must submit the basis for its belief to the court, and may do so through the filing of an affidavit.

    e. If the court finds the respondent in contempt, the court may impose remedial sanctions designed to ensure swift compliance with the order to surrender and prohibit weapons.

    f. The court may order a respondent found in contempt of the order to pay for any losses incurred by a party in connection with the contempt proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees, service fees, and other costs. The costs of the proceeding must not be borne by the petitioner.

    f. Upon vacating the dwelling unit, the tenant must deliver the key and all copies of the key to the landlord by mail or personal delivery by a third party.
