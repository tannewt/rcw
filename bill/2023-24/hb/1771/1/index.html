<ol>
<li>
<p>If a manufactured/mobile home park is, or is scheduled to be, closed or converted to another use, eligible tenants shall be entitled to relocation assistance on a first-come, first-serve basis. The department shall give priority for distribution of relocation assistance to eligible tenants residing in parks that are closed as a result of park-owner fraud or as a result of health and safety concerns as determined by the local board of health. Payments shall be made upon the department's verification of eligibility, subject to the availability of remaining funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligibility for relocation assistance funds is limited to low-income households in manufactured/mobile home parks that are, or are scheduled to be, closed or converted to another use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible tenants are entitled to financial assistance from the fund, up to a maximum of $17,000 for a multisection home and up to a maximum of $11,000 for a single-section home. The department shall distribute relocation assistance for each eligible tenant as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>$12,000 for a multisection home and $8,000 for a single-section home shall be disbursed in the form of cash assistance to help the tenant relocate the home or secure alternative housing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remainder of the total assistance shall be disbursed once the tenant has transferred the title to the park-owner, relocated the home, or demolished and disposed of the home. The tenant must either transfer title of the manufactured/mobile home to the park-owner, relocate, or demolish and dispose of the home by the park closure date to receive the remainder of the assistance. A tenant who removes the tenant's home on or before the park closure date and reinstalls the home in another location within 12 months after the closure date is eligible to receive the remainder of the assistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>A tenant is not entitled to relocation assistance under this chapter if: (1) The tenant has given notice to the landlord of his or her intent to vacate the park and terminate the tenancy before any written notice of closure pursuant to RCW 59.20.080(1)(e) has been given; or (2) the tenant purchased a mobile home already situated in the park or moved a mobile home into the park after a written notice of closure pursuant to RCW 59.20.090 has been given and the person received actual prior notice of the change or closure. However, no tenant may be denied relocation assistance under subsection (1) of this section if the tenant has remained on the premises and continued paying rent for a period of at least six months after giving notice of intent to vacate and before receiving formal notice of a closure or change of use.</p>
