<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a multilingual, multiliterate education will benefit all Washington students. A multilingual, multiliterate student body is better prepared to enter a global job market, has developed cognitive skills unique to working within two or more languages, and can build cohesive communities across the state while sharing, celebrating, and strengthening individual cultural ties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that school districts across the state are demonstrating readiness to develop dual language education programs, and that requests for current grant funding consistently surpass available dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that English learners benefit from specific instructional models and supports to thrive in public schools, and that dual language education is the best instructional model for providing those supports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state has a special duty to honor tribal sovereignty and to serve American Indian and Alaska Native students. The legislature recognizes that centuries of colonial educational practices aimed at destruction of tribal communities and cultures has resulted in intergenerational trauma that continues to negatively impact American Indian and Alaska Native learners, and that state investment in tribal language education programs in K-12 schools will move all Washingtonians forward together in addressing and healing those wounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish a comprehensive approach to support and expand dual language education and tribal language education in Washington state. It is the goal of the legislature that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>School districts with a kindergarten enrollment of more than 25 English learners of at least one language group in one or more individual schools will begin the planning process for a dual language program by the 2026-27 school year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts with a kindergarten enrollment of more than 25 English learners of at least one language group across all schools in the district will begin the planning process for a dual language program by the 2029-30 school year; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All Washington students will have access to dual language education in kindergarten through eighth grade by 2040.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
