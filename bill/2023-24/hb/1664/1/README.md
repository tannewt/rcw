# HB 1664 - Env. justice council/rural

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1664.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the duties of the environmental justice council include making recommendations on the distribution of billions of dollars of state revenue and oversight of agency programs and projects that relate to improved environmental outcomes for overburdened communities and vulnerable populations. The legislature finds that 30 of 39 Washington counties are designated as rural counties under state law and that poverty rates are higher in rural counties than urban counties. Ensuring rural representation is important because environmental burdens are not limited to urban areas, and in fact many of the most highly impacted communities in the state, using the department of health's map at least for purposes of the clean energy transformation act, are in rural counties. The legislature intends counties to improve the representation of Washington's people on the environmental justice council by requiring that at least one-half of the council's membership reside in rural counties.
