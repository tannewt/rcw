<li>
<p>The legislature finds that in adopting revised greenhouse gas emissions limits in 2020, the legislature was explicit that nothing in the revision created new or additional regulatory authority for any state agency. The legislature further finds that state statutory greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets were never intended to serve as criteria for decisions to issue permits for individual projects or programs. The legislature further finds that when adopting these targets, it was explicitly stated that the achievement of these targets should be pursued in a manner that supports the skilled and trained construction workforce, retains or creates other high quality employment opportunities, and generates economic benefits for the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature observes that in January 2021, a state agency did cite the revised greenhouse gas emissions limits as a basis for denial of a permit application that would have resulted in major investment and job creation in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In April 2021, the legislature adopted a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions cap and invest regulatory program that contains within its scheme the direction to the department of ecology to set the emissions budget for covered entities in a manner that is consistent with state targets (RCW 70A.65.070(2)). Therefore, the legislature finds that the existence of the cap and invest program, which will effectively keep emissions from covered entities in line with state targets, is an additional reason to not evaluate individual permit applications with respect to consistency with the state greenhouse gas emissions targets for any entity that would be covered under the cap and invest program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the legislature intends to explicitly forbid state agencies from using the aggregate state greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in any consideration of individual permit applications.</p>

<p>(1)(a) The state shall limit anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to achieve the following emission reductions for Washington state:</p>
