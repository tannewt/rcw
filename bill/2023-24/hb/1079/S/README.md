For the purposes of this subsection (12), "rapid whole genome sequencing" means the unbiased sequencing of all deoxyribonucleic acid bases in the genome of a patient and, if for the sole benefit of the patient, a biological parent of such individual for the purpose of determining whether one or more potentially disease-causing genetic variants are present in the genome of the patient or the patient's biological parent. The term includes any analysis, interpretation, and data report derived from such sequencing.
