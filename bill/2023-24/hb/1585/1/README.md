1. Before adopting an ordinance or resolution creating one or more local infrastructure project areas, a sponsoring city must:

    a. Provide notice to the county assessor, county treasurer, and county within the proposed local infrastructure project area of the sponsoring city's intent to create one or more local infrastructure project areas. This notice must be provided at least 180 days in advance of the public hearing as required by (b) of this subsection;

    b. Hold a public hearing on the proposed formation of the local infrastructure project area.

2. A sponsoring city may create one or more local infrastructure project areas by ordinance or resolution that:

    a. Describes the proposed public improvements, identified in the plan under RCW 39.108.080, to be financed in each local infrastructure project area;

    b. Describes the boundaries of each local infrastructure project area, subject to the limitations in RCW 39.108.130; and

    c. Provides the date when the use of local property tax allocation revenues will commence and a list of the participating taxing districts.

3. The sponsoring city must deliver a certified copy of the adopted ordinance or resolution to the county assessor, county treasurer, and each other participating taxing district within which the local infrastructure project area is located.

4. The sponsoring city must adopt the department of commerce transfer of development rights interlocal terms and conditions in WAC 365-198-040 and 365-198-060, or its successors, and, if required by an eligible county, enter into a superseding interlocal agreement prior to the date when the use of local property tax allocation revenues will commence for any local infrastructure project area formed after the effective date of this section. An interlocal agreement under this subsection shall define the roles and responsibilities of the parties with respect to the transfer of development rights as determined by the parties.

## Section 2
1. Except as provided in this chapter, the levy for a taxing district in any year must be set so that the regular property taxes payable in the following year do not exceed the limit factor multiplied by the amount of regular property taxes lawfully levied for such district in the highest of the three most recent years in which such taxes were levied for such district, excluding any increase due to (e) of this subsection, unless the highest levy was the statutory maximum rate amount, plus an additional dollar amount calculated by multiplying the regular property tax levy rate of that district for the preceding year by the increase in assessed value in that district resulting from:

    a. New construction;

    b. Increases in assessed value due to construction of wind turbine, solar, biomass, and geothermal facilities, if such facilities generate electricity and the property is not included elsewhere under this section for purposes of providing an additional dollar amount.

    d. Any increase in the assessed value of state-assessed property;

    e.

This subsection (1)(e) does not apply to levies by the state or by port districts and public utility districts for the purpose of making required payments of principal and interest on general indebtedness; and

    f. For taxing districts defined in RCW 39.108.010(23) in any year in which distributions may be made under RCW 39.108.150, any increase in the assessed value within any local infrastructure project area, as defined in RCW 39.108.010(5), to the extent that such increase in assessed value is not included under (a) through (e) of this subsection.

1. New construction;

2. Increases in assessed value due to construction of wind turbine, solar, biomass, and geothermal facilities, if such facilities generate electricity and the property is not included elsewhere under this section for purposes of providing an additional dollar amount.

## Section 4
Notwithstanding the limitation set forth in RCW 84.55.010, the first levy for a taxing district created from consolidation of similar taxing districts must be set so that the regular property taxes payable in the following year do not exceed the limit factor multiplied by the sum of the amount of regular property taxes lawfully levied for each component taxing district in the highest of the three most recent years in which such taxes were levied for such district plus the additional dollar amount calculated by multiplying the regular property tax rate of each component district for the preceding year by the increase in assessed value in each component district resulting from:

1. New construction;

## Section 5
For the first levy for a taxing district following annexation of additional property, the limitation set forth in RCW 84.55.010 must be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate assessed valuation of the newly annexed property as shown by the current completed and balanced tax rolls of the county or counties within which such property lies, multiplied by the dollar rate that would have been used by the annexing unit in the absence of such annexation, plus the additional dollar amount calculated by multiplying the regular property tax levy rate of that annexing taxing district for the preceding year by the increase in assessed value in the annexing district resulting from:

1. New construction;

## Section 6
1. A taxing district, other than the state, that collects regular levies must hold a public hearing on revenue sources for the district's following year's current expense budget. The hearing must include consideration of possible increases in property tax revenues and must be held prior to the time the taxing district levies the taxes or makes the request to have the taxes levied. The county legislative authority, or the taxing district's governing body if the district is a city, town, or other type of district, must hold the hearing. For purposes of this section, "current expense budget" means that budget which is primarily funded by taxes and charges and reflects the provision of ongoing services. It does not mean the capital, enterprise, or special assessment budgets of cities, towns, counties, or special purpose districts.

2. If the taxing district is otherwise required to hold a public hearing on its proposed regular tax levy, a single public hearing may be held on this matter.

Except as provided in (b) of this subsection (3), no increase in property tax revenue may be authorized by a taxing district, other than the state, except by adoption of a separate ordinance or resolution, pursuant to notice, specifically authorizing the increase in terms of both dollars and percentage. The ordinance or resolution may cover a period of up to two years, but the ordinance must specifically state for each year the dollar increase and percentage change in the levy from the previous year.

    b. Exempt from the requirements of (a) of this subsection are increases in revenue resulting from the addition of:

        i. New construction;

        iv. Any increase in the value of state‑assessed property;

This subsection (3)(b)(v) does not apply to levies by the state or by port districts and public utility districts for the purpose of making required payments of principal and interest on general indebtedness; and
