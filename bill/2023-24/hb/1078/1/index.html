<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there is currently a shortage of housing, particularly affordable housing, within the state. The legislature finds one of the most efficient and sustainable ways to address this shortage is through the development of housing options within existing urban growth areas. The legislature also finds that tree canopy and green space are necessary for the health and wellness of urban growth area residents.</p>
<p>In regulating the removal of trees during development, however, cities sometimes impose regulations that limit or prevent development opportunities that would provide needed additional housing, even if the removal of trees in those circumstances would not impair the health of the community. At the same time, the critical need for additional trees in other areas of the city may go unaddressed. Therefore, is the intent of the legislature to assist in balancing these needs by providing that, when cities do regulate the removal of trees, they allow developers who are removing trees in a noncritical area to add trees to areas in which the need for trees is most acute, such as areas that have historically suffered from environmental inequality and health disparities, areas subject to the urban heat island effect, and areas in which the trees will most benefit salmon and orca recovery efforts.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any city or town that has or that enacts an ordinance promoting or regulating urban forestry management or the care of trees must amend or include within its ordinance an option that allows obligations for the protection and management of trees imposed by the ordinance to be satisfied through the use of a tree bank in compliance with the guidelines established by the department of natural resources in RCW 76.15.110(6). For the purposes of this section, &quot;urban forestry&quot; has the meaning provided in RCW 76.15.010.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any code city that has or that enacts an ordinance promoting or regulating urban forestry management or the care of trees must amend or include within its ordinance an option that allows obligations for the protection and management of trees imposed by the ordinance to be satisfied through the use of a tree bank in compliance with the guidelines established by the department of natural resources in RCW 76.15.110(6). For the purposes of this section, &quot;urban forestry&quot; has the meaning provided in RCW 76.15.010.</p>
