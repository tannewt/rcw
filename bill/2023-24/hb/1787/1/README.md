[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1787.pdf)

## Section 1
The trucking industry is vital to Washington state's economy. In order to make the flow of goods by the trucking industry possible, there must be appropriate infrastructure to accommodate the needs of the men and women who drive and work on the trucks, and to service the trucks themselves. Some local governments in Washington have not planned sufficiently for those needs or have erected barriers to developing such infrastructure. The joint transportation committee has received recommendations in a truck parking action plan. The action plan includes immediate actions to have governments build parking, provide incentives to build truck parking in high-demand areas, and have governments plan for truck parking and other necessary facilities. The legislature intends for this act to promote action to increase these much needed facilities.

## Section 2
1. As part of the safety policy goal established in RCW 47.04.280(1), the department must establish a plan for the department and other state agencies to facilitate the establishment and operation of commercial truck parking located near interstate highways, ports, and other areas that generate significant amounts of commercial truck trips. This plan should include proposals for public investment in truck parking as well as recommending or providing incentives for nonpublic investment in such parking.

2. During the years 2023 to 2030, the department must annually report to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature on the known increases to commercial truck parking near Interstates 2, 5, and 90, and any of the ports. The department must reach out to local governments, ports, and a state association representing commercial trucking companies when preparing the report.

## Section 3
With funding provided in the omnibus transportation appropriations act, the department of transportation, in consultation with members of port authorities, trucking industries, counties, and cities, shall develop and implement a program to provide direct assistance to counties and cities for the preparation of comprehensive plan amendments, development regulations, and expedited permitting programs, land purchases, building incentives, and construction funding to assist in development of truck parking facilities, including collocations with restaurants and showering facilities available for commercial truck drivers.

## Section 4
Cities must allow commercial truck parking near ports, warehouses, and the national highway system in areas frequently used by commercial trucks. Cities may not prohibit the establishment of commercial truck parking in areas where there are commercial or industrial developments, and are encouraged to facilitate the development of areas where commercial truck drivers may abide for periods of rest. Commercial truck parking facilities should include restrooms, showers, equipment to facilitate idle reduction allowing for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and electric services to be powered from on-site, and security measures. Some locations should be collocated, abutting, or very near restaurants and grocery stores that can accommodate commercial trucks with trailers.

## Section 5
Cities must plan for and allow commercial truck parking near ports, warehouses, and the national highway system in areas frequently used by commercial trucks. Cities may not prohibit the establishment of commercial truck parking in areas where there are commercial or industrial developments, and are encouraged to facilitate the development of areas where commercial truck drivers may abide for periods of rest. Commercial truck parking facilities should include restrooms, showers, equipment to facilitate idle reduction allowing for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and electric services to be powered from on-site, and security measures. Some locations should be collocated, abutting, or very near restaurants and grocery stores that can accommodate commercial trucks with trailers.

## Section 6
Counties must allow commercial truck parking near ports, warehouses, and the national highway system in areas frequently used by commercial trucks. Counties may not prohibit the establishment of commercial truck parking in areas where there are commercial or industrial developments, and are encouraged to facilitate the development of areas where commercial truck drivers may abide for periods of rest. Commercial truck parking facilities should include restrooms, showers, equipment to facilitate idle reduction allowing for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and electric services to be powered from on-site, and security measures. Some locations should be collocated, abutting, or very near restaurants and grocery stores that can accommodate commercial trucks with trailers.

## Section 7
The comprehensive plan of a county or city that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall consist of a map or maps, and descriptive text covering objectives, principles, and standards used to develop the comprehensive plan. The plan shall be an internally consistent document and all elements shall be consistent with the future land use map. A comprehensive plan shall be adopted and amended with public participation as provided in RCW 36.70A.140. Each comprehensive plan shall include a plan, scheme, or design for each of the following:

## Section 8
Planning cities and counties as part of the transportation requirements in RCW 36.70A.070(6) must address the following issues:

1. Each must plan to provide sufficient parking locations to accommodate delivery of goods.

    a. Each may require properties that are to receive delivery from commercial trucks to have a way to accommodate those vehicles, preferably on-site.

    b. Each must require communities to have commercial truck parking near ports, warehouses, and the national highway system in areas frequently used by commercial trucks. Counties and cities may not prohibit the establishment of commercial truck parking in areas where there are commercial or industrial developments. They are encouraged to facilitate the development of areas where commercial truck drivers may abide for periods of rest. Commercial truck parking facilities should include restrooms, showers, equipment to facilitate idle reduction allowing for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and electric services to be powered from on-site, and security measures. Some locations should be collocated, abutting, or very near restaurants and grocery stores that can accommodate the commercial trucks.

    c. Multifamily residential buildings within the urban growth area are to have locations where light duty, package delivery, or moving trucks can temporarily park without obstructing the flow of vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic on the streets, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks.

2. Each must plan to provide and maintain streets designed, sized, and constructed to be used by heavy commercial trucks in appropriate locations.

3. For counties or cities with a population greater than 75,000, each must plan for and permit locations where large commercial vehicles can receive maintenance, repairs, and services.
