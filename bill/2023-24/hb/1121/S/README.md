4. In an abduction prevention order, the court may impose conditions on the exercise of custody or visitation that:

    a. Limit visitation or require that visitation with the child by the respondent be supervised until the court finds that supervision is no longer necessary and order the respondent to pay the costs of supervision;

    b. Require the respondent to post a bond or provide other security in an amount sufficient to serve as a financial deterrent to abduction, the proceeds of which may be used to pay for the reasonable expenses of recovery of the child, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs if there is an abduction; and

    c. Require the respondent to obtain education on the potentially harmful effects to the child from abduction.

    c. Grant any other relief allowed under the law of this state other than this chapter.

6. The remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and do not affect the availability of other remedies to prevent abduction.

## Section 9
1. If a petition under this chapter contains allegations, and the court finds that there is a credible risk that the child is imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue an ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.

2. The respondent on a petition under subsection (1) of this section must be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later than the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.

3. An ex parte warrant under subsection (1) of this section to take physical custody of a child must:

    a. Recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible risk of imminent wrongful removal of the child is based;

    b. Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately;

    c. State the date and time for the hearing on the petition; and

    d. Provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending further order of the court.

4. If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining the placement of the child after the warrant is executed, the court may order a search of the relevant databases of the national crime information center system and similar state databases to determine if either the petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.

5. The petition and warrant must be served on the respondent when or immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.

6. A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, is enforceable throughout this state. If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.

7. If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under subsection (1) of this section for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the respondent reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.

8. This chapter does not affect the availability of relief allowed under other laws of this state.

## Section 10
An abduction prevention order remains in effect until the earliest of:

1. The time stated in the order;

2. The emancipation of the child;

3. The child's attaining 18 years of age; or

4. The time the order is modified, revoked, vacated, or superseded by a court with jurisdiction under RCW 26.27.201, 26.27.211, and 26.27.221.

## Section 11
In applying and construing this uniform act, consideration must be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it.

## Section 12
This act modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001, et seq., but does not modify, limit, or supersede section 101(c) of the act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001(c) of that act, or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in section 103(b) of that act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 7003(b).
