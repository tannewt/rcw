<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state is the most trade focused state in the nation. International trade and investment is responsible for one-fifth of private sector jobs in Washington. Washington is the fourth largest exporter in the United States, and the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area is the third largest exporting metropolitan area. Almost 90 percent of the 12,000 companies that export from Washington were small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington's trade focus has advantages and disadvantages. Washington's trade focus provides job and income growth opportunities during times of peace, but also great economic risk in the event of geopolitical disruption. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that the department of commerce increase its planning and assistance for diversifying export markets for Washington businesses.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department shall report to the legislature by July 1, 2024, on the anticipated economic impacts in Washington state in the event of a major disruption to trade with any of Washington's historic top trading partners, and make policy recommendations on how the department could be equipped to provide business assistance to impacted exporters and their employees in Washington. The report must include a description of current efforts to diversify Washington state trade relationships and decrease reliance on any one particular trading partner.</p>
