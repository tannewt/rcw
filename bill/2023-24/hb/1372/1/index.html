<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there is a need to make more information available to the public and decision makers about the costs and benefits, both economic and environmental, of converting fleets of vehicles from gasoline-powered engines to electric batteries. The legislature finds that in using taxpayer dollars to procure vehicles for use by state government, the public has a right to expect a transparent evaluation of the cost per mile driven of electric vehicles compared to similar gasoline-powered vehicles, and how much of their money is being spent per ton of carbon emissions reduced taking into account the emissions that go into the production of the vehicles as well as the emissions from operation. Therefore, in order to track the trends over time, the legislature intends to require the publication of a report every two years concerning the tradeoffs in the transition of the electrification of the state vehicle fleet.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) State agencies shall meet the statewide greenhouse gas emission limits established in RCW 70A.45.020 to achieve the following, using the estimates and strategy established in subsections (2) and (3) of this section:</p>
