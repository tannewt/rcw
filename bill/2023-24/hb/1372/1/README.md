The legislature finds that in using taxpayer dollars to procure vehicles for use by state government, the public has a right to expect a transparent evaluation of the cost per mile driven of electric vehicles compared to similar gasoline-powered vehicles, and how much of their money is being spent per ton of carbon emissions reduced taking into account the emissions that go into the production of the vehicles as well as the emissions from operation. Therefore, in order to track the trends over time, the legislature intends to require the publication of a report every two years concerning the tradeoffs in the transition of the electrification of the state vehicle fleet.
