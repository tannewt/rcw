<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there is a great need to train and educate a clean energy workforce that is sufficient to achieve the projected deployment levels of clean energy technologies that are needed to achieve a low emissions economy like solar, wind, nuclear, battery storage, and energy efficiency. There is also a need to inspire people to seek out those career opportunities. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to empower public-private partnerships that will help our state to build workforce capacity in these areas at sufficient scale and speed.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to establish a joint clean and renewable energy workforce training center (CREW center) to educate and train the workforce for the energy transition. The legislature intends to colocate in the vicinity of the CREW center a state-of-the-art visitor center with educational exhibits open to the general public. The first purpose of the visitor center is to inspire interest in careers in the clean energy economy and grow the pipeline of students who seek training at the CREW center. The second purpose of the visitor center is to equip citizens with knowledge about electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and storage that will help them participate in public policy issues surrounding the clean energy transition. This visitor center may be known as the secure power from American resources center (SPARC center).</p>
<p>The legislature finds that the Tri-Cities region is ideally situated to host these facilities, because of its abundance of nonemitting electricity generating resources, the presence of a national laboratory working on electric grid resilience, and excellent academic and technical faculty.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A clean and renewable energy workforce training center must be established jointly with a secure power from American resources center in the Tri-Cities area to do the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide workforce training for employees pursuing careers in clean and renewable energy through on-site training and undergraduate and graduate internships;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide clean and renewable energy educational learning experiences for visitors of all ages through interactive exhibits; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide informational exhibits exploring the various aspects of careers and educational opportunities in clean and renewable energy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clean and renewable energy workforce training center and the secure power from American resources center may be operated and administered jointly as an education, training, and research center providing clean energy job training, career education, and research under the authority of Washington State University Tri-Cities and a joint operating agency pursuant to chapter 43.52 RCW. The joint clean and renewable energy workforce training and secure power from American resources centers may be made available to all four-year institutions of higher education as defined in RCW 28B.10.016 and all community and technical colleges as defined in RCW 28B.50.030. Resources for career training may include internships, on-the-job training, and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and faculty.</p>
