<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that robocalls are increasingly used by entities to mislead and deceive Washington residents and induce them into providing money or personally identifying information. It is the intent of the legislature to expand the scope of existing provisions in RCW 80.36.390, 80.36.400, and 19.158.020 regulating robocalls and telephone solicitations to prohibit telephone communications that mislead or harm Washington residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the most effective way to prevent illegal robocalling is to ensure that those calls never originate or enter the telephone network. Therefore, it is further the intent of the legislature to extend liability to those persons who provide substantial assistance or support in the origination and transmission of robocalls that violate RCW 80.36.400.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the intent of the legislature to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Include a provision in RCW 80.36.400 and 80.36.390 to prohibit the initiation of an unsolicited robocall sent using an automatic dialing and announcing device to a Washington telephone number on the do not call registry maintained by the federal government pursuant to the telemarketing sales rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 310, and 47 C.F.R. Sec. 64.1200;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearly define exceptions for businesses to be allowed to initiate calls using an automatic dialing and announcing device to communicate with ongoing customers or any potential customer who provides prior consent; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combat fraudulent or misleading caller identification.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<li>
<p>&quot;Automatic dialing and announcing device &quot; means an automated system for the dialing of a telephone number and the transmission of a voice communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Voice communication&quot; means any communication, in whole or in part, by means of an artificial or prerecorded message. &quot;Voice communication&quot; includes, without limitation, any voice message transmitted directly to a recipient's voicemail, regardless of whether the recipient's phone rings as part of the transmission. Automated warnings required by law, without more, do not turn a communication into a &quot;voice communication&quot; under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Commercial solicitation&quot; means the  initiation of a voice communication for the purpose of encouraging a person to purchase property, goods, or services, provide personally identifying information, or obtain anything of value.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>&quot;Commercial solicitation&quot; does not include any person who has provided written consent in advance of receiving the commercial solicitation. Written consent may be given electronically, provided that the consenting person is given a clear, detailed disclosure as to what communications the consenting person is agreeing to receive, and the consent only applies to communications from the person seeking consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Commercial solicitation&quot; also does not include that portion of a voice communication involving live conversation between the recipient and a person with whom that recipient has an established business relationship.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Established business relationship&quot; means an existing relationship formed by a voluntary two-way communication between a person or entity and a business, with or without an exchange of consideration, on the basis of an application, purchase, or transaction regarding property, goods, or services offered by the business or entity, which relationship has not been previously terminated by either party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Person&quot; has the same meaning as defined in RCW 19.158.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Personally identifying information&quot; has the same meaning as defined in RCW 19.190.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>&quot;Assist in the transmission&quot; means actions taken by a person to provide substantial assistance or support, which enables any person to originate, initiate, or transmit a commercial solicitation when the person providing the assistance knows or avoids knowing that the initiator of the commercial solicitation is engaged, or intends to engage, in any practice that violates this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Assist in the transmission&quot; does not include activities of (A) any entity related to the design, manufacture, or distribution of any technology, product, or component that has a commercially significant use other than to violate or circumvent this section; (B) a telecommunications provider or other entity that are limited to providing access to the internet for purposes excluding initiation of a voice communication; or (C) a terminating provider relating to the completion of a voice communication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Terminating provider&quot; means a telecommunications provider upon whose network a voice communication terminates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>initiate a commercial solicitation using an automatic dialing and announcing device to any telephone number with a Washington area code, or to a telephone registered to any person that is a Washington resident.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>No person may assist in the transmission of a commercial solicitation described in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may initiate a commercial solicitation using an automatic dialing and announcing device to any telephone number with a Washington area code, or to a telephone registered to any person that is a Washington resident, on the do not call registry maintained by the federal government pursuant to the telemarketing sales rule, 16 C.F.R. Part 310, and 47 C.F.R. Sec. 64.1200 as currently enacted or subsequently amended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may assist in the transmission of a commercial solicitation described in subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the practices covered by this section are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this section is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. In addition to all remedies available in chapter 19.86 RCW, a person who is injured under this section may bring a civil action in the superior court to enjoin further violations, and shall recover actual damages or $1,000 per violation of this section, whichever is greater.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Washington utilities and transportation commission from adopting additional rules regulating automatic dialing and announcing devices.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If, at any time during the telephone contact, the called party states or indicates they want to end the call, the telephone solicitor must end the call within 10 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
