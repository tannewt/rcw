<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Legislation enacted in 2022, chapter 180, Laws of 2022, contains numerous provisions intended to decrease the generation of methane gas in landfills from organic materials, by increasing the diversion of organic materials to compost and other organic materials management facilities. The legislature finds that there is urgency in the state's efforts to ensure that compost streams are limited to compostable organic materials and are not hindered by unsuitable contaminants. At present, organic materials management facilities in Washington vary in the types of feedstocks that are accepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must contract with an independent third-party facilitator to convene a stakeholder advisory committee. The advisory committee shall make recommendations to the appropriate committees of the legislature on the development of standards for the management of compostable products, especially food service products, by composting and other organic materials management facilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing recommendations, the stakeholder advisory committee must, at a minimum, consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The state's goals of managing organic materials, including food waste, in an environmentally sustainable way that increases food waste diversion and ensures that finished compost is clean and marketable, with the intent of being consistent with and furthering the improvements identified in chapter 180, Laws of 2022;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The types of compostable products, and amounts if known, sold or distributed into Washington;</p>

<li>
<p>Provide staff and support to the stakeholder advisory committee meetings; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draft reports and other materials for review by the stakeholder advisory committee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facilitator shall submit a report to the legislature by September 15, 2024, containing the recommendations of the stakeholder advisory committee after review and approval by the facilitator and committee. The department and its hired facilitator must convene the first stakeholder meeting by September 15, 2023, and must convene meetings at least monthly thereafter through January, on a schedule developed in consultation with the stakeholders serving on the advisory committee. All meetings of the stakeholder advisory committee must be held in a virtual format. The stakeholder advisory committee shall make recommendations using consensus-based decision making. The report must include recommendations where general stakeholder consensus has been achieved and note dissenting opinions where stakeholder consensus has not been achieved.</p>
