The document must be based on the template created as required under section 3 of this act.

    a. If the parent of the student requested an evaluation of the student as part of a referral request for special education services, then the parent is presumed to have consented to the evaluation and the school district must conduct an evaluation and determine whether the student is eligible for special education services within 25 business days, except as provided in rule, of making its evaluation decision under subsection (2) of this section; or

    b. If someone other than the parent of the student made the referral request for special education services or if the parent of the student did not specifically request an evaluation of the student as part of a referral request, then the school district must:

        i. At the same time as it makes the notification under subsection (3) of this section, provide the student's parent with a document describing how and when to provide parental consent to evaluate. The document must be based on the template created as required under section 3 of this act; and

        ii. Within 25 business days, except as provided in rule, of receiving a parent's written or oral consent to evaluate the student, conduct an evaluation and determine whether the student is eligible for special education services.

## Section 3
The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall collaborate with the office of the education ombuds to create a template for school districts to use to meet the requirement in section 2 (1) and (4) of this section related to providing initial special education evaluation process information to parents. The template must be translated as for limited English proficient parent groups described in section 7(2) of this act. The template and its translations must be made publicly available on the website of the office of the superintendent of public instruction.

## Section 4
1. With regard to parent participation in individualized education program team meetings, a school district must provide prior notification to parents about the accommodations available for persons with disabilities who are in need of communication assistance or accommodations to fully participate in the meeting, including the option to record audio under certain circumstances. Examples of "persons with disabilities who are in need of communication assistance or accommodations" are persons with hearing or speech disabilities and persons with limited English proficiency.

2. Within five business days after receiving a request from a parent to convene an individualized education program team meeting, a school district must respond to a parent in writing with either an agreement to convene a meeting within 15 school days or an explanation for why a meeting is unnecessary. If responding that the meeting is unnecessary, the school district must also provide instructions for how and by what deadlines the parent may seek reconsideration of the school district's decision, through an informal process or through a formal appeal or complaint process.

3. Paraeducators, and other staff employed or contracted by the school district to provide special education or related services, who provide a significant level of support to a student on a regular basis must be invited to and compensated for participation in the student's individualized education program team meetings.

The school district has the burden of proof and the burden of production whenever it is a party to a due process hearing regarding the identification of, evaluation of, reevaluation of, classification of, educational placement of, disciplinary action of, or provision of a free appropriate public education to, a student with a disability.

2. In a due process hearing, evidence showing that a student has not failed or been retained in a course or grade, and is advancing from grade to grade, does not create the presumption that the school has provided the student with a free appropriate public education as required by the federal individuals with disabilities education act, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et seq.

3. In a due process hearing related to parent participation in the adoption of an individualized education program, the superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent's designee may order the individualized education program team to reconvene with a qualified interpreter, so that the parent can fully participate in any adoption of an individualized education program.

## Section 13
There is established in the office of the superintendent of public instruction an administrative section or unit for the education of children with disabilities who require special education.

Students with disabilities are those children whether enrolled in school or not who through an evaluation process are determined eligible for special education due to a disability.

In accordance with part B of the federal individuals with disabilities education improvement act and any other federal or state laws relating to the provision of special education services, the superintendent of public instruction shall require each school district in the state to insure an appropriate educational opportunity for all children with disabilities between the ages of three and twenty-one, but when the twenty-first birthday occurs during the school year, the educational program may be continued until the end of that school year. The superintendent of public instruction, by rule, shall establish for the purpose of excess cost funding, as provided in RCW 28A.150.390, 28A.160.030, and this chapter, functional definitions of special education, the various types of disabling conditions, and eligibility criteria for special education programs for children with disabilities, including referral procedures, use of positive behavior interventions, the education curriculum and statewide or district‑wide assessments, parent and district requests for special education due process hearings, and procedural safeguards. For the purposes of this chapter, an appropriate education is defined as an education directed to the unique needs, abilities, and limitations of the children with disabilities who are enrolled either full time or part time in a school district. School districts are strongly encouraged to provide parental training in the care and education of the children and to involve parents in the classroom.

Nothing in this section shall prohibit the establishment or continuation of existing cooperative programs between school districts or contracts with other agencies approved by the superintendent of public instruction, which can meet the obligations of school districts to provide education for children with disabilities, or prohibit the continuation of needed related services to school districts by the department of social and health services.

## Section 16
For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the board of directors of every school district shall be authorized to contract with agencies approved by the superintendent of public instruction for operating special education programs for students with disabilities. Approval standards for such agencies shall conform substantially with those of special education programs in the common schools.

## Section 19
School districts may use curriculum‑based assessment procedures as measures for developing academic early intervening services, as defined under part B of the federal individuals with disabilities education improvement act, and curriculum planning: PROVIDED, That the use of curriculum‑based assessment procedures shall not deny a student the right to use of other assessments to determine eligibility or participation in special education programs as provided by this chapter.
