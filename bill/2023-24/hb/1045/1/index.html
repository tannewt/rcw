<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that economic inequality continues to widen the gap between the top few earners and working and low-income families. The 2021 &quot;Labor Market and Economic Report&quot; produced by the Washington state employment security department paints a grim picture: Corporate profits increased by over 500 percent from 2000 to 2021 while everyday Washington residents filed more unemployment claims than ever with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that 22 percent of Washington's adult population has a disability, and more than a quarter of a million of Washington residents have impairments related to mobility, cognition, dressing, and bathing that may prohibit participation in the workforce. A 2021 report generated by the centers for disease control and prevention about disability in Washington state urged that &quot;everyone can play a role in supporting more inclusive state programs to help people with, or at risk for, disabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that certain major life transitions or conditions are associated with high economic instability, including being pregnant or a parent of a young child; experiencing homelessness; being an immigrant, refugee, or asylee; exiting from the foster care system, the juvenile justice system, or the criminal justice system; exiting a relationship or living situation due to domestic violence; or having a disability or behavioral health disorder. These priority populations disproportionately experience poverty.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that climate change will spread disease faster than in the past, creating a new normal where interruption of the labor market, quarantines, and mass-disabling events like those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic become more common place.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature declares that all Washington households deserve basic financial security and that it is the goal of the state to ensure economic sustainability for all families. In 1997, the state legislature created WorkFirst, Washington's temporary assistance for needy families program, to aid the state's struggling families. Then in 2009, it created the working families' tax credit to provide additional assistance to Washington residents and then funded the program in 2021. These measures were taken because direct cash assistance is a proven way to support people and households struggling to cover essential expenses.</p>
<p>The department of social and health services recently completed a basic income feasibility study pointing strongly to the conclusion that Washington residents excluded from social and economic well-being would benefit from a statewide basic income program. The legislature finds that a direct cash assistance program with no restrictions or requirements for recipients would help Washington residents struggling under the weight of unprecedented income inequalities.</p>
