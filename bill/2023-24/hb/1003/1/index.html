<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that dual credit enrollment in high school improves college attendance, persistence, and completion, especially for low-income students. Students who enrolled in dual credit courses in high school improve their likelihood of college success. They are more likely to graduate college and more likely to complete their bachelor's degree within four years. However, the legislature also finds that low-income students are less likely to access dual credit opportunities in high school, and they are subsequently less likely to apply to college and to complete their bachelor's degree within four years. The legislature finds that when students who have financial need in college first obtain dual credits while in high school, they improve their likelihood of college success. In addition, students who are eligible for financial aid in college actually reduce costs to the state by pursuing dual credit enrollment while in high school.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to remove barriers to dual credit participation in high school, especially for low-income students, by subsidizing all dual credit costs and fees for students whose family incomes would make them eligible for state financial aid in college. It is also the intent of the legislature to encourage low-income students to complete dual credit courses in high school by sharing the savings to which these students' efforts contributed, in the form of a $1,000 payment to eligible students who complete their first year of college.</p>
