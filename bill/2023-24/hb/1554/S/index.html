<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that even though lead is a widely recognized hazard to human health and to the environment, and leaded motor vehicle gasoline was phased out across the United States decades ago, leaded gasoline remains in widespread use at general aviation airports by piston engine noncommercial aircraft. Recent studies have found elevated levels of lead in the blood of residents, and particularly worryingly in the blood of children residing in general aviation airport communities, for whom lead is especially harmful to their development. There is consensus among the medical and scientific communities that the levels detected in children living around general airports similar to those in Washington are hazardous. The national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine in 2015 concluded that lead &quot;is a well-known air pollutant that can lead to a variety of adverse health impacts, including neurological effects in children that lead to behavioral problems, learning deficits, and lowered IQ.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United States environmental protection agency has recently taken steps towards making an endangerment finding that may eventually lead, through a complex federal regulatory process involving the United States federal aviation administration, to the elimination of lead from aviation gasoline. That unfolding federal process is too slow to adequately protect those currently living near general aviation airports from the harms of lead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to take steps to mitigate public health and environmental harms caused by the use of leaded gasoline at airports, and to expedite the transition to the use of unleaded aviation gasoline.</p>

<li>
<p>The department of transportation, in consultation with the department, must develop simple guidance that can easily and quickly be implemented by airport operators to minimize public health and environmental exposures to lead associated with airport operations. It is the intent of the legislature for this guidance, in the form of a document, to prioritize actions that can be taken by airport operators most quickly and easily to achieve meaningful reductions in lead exposures from airport operations, and with priority given to actions capable of being implemented in the shorter term and that will not be unduly costly or time-consuming to implement, in light of the expectation that alternative lead-free aviation gasoline is anticipated to become more widely available within a decade. The guidance document must be based upon the 2021 consensus study report of the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine related to options for reducing lead emissions from piston-engine aircraft. The department of transportation may consult with the department of health and local air authorities activated under chapter 70A.15 RCW in the development of guidance under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of transportation must publish initial guidance to airport operators by July 1, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of transportation must review the guidance required in (b) of this subsection and publish updated guidance under this section by July 1, 2026, and may periodically update its review and guidance thereafter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the guidance under subsection (1) of this section, the department of transportation must include high-priority actions that airport operators will be able to expeditiously implement and that will achieve the most significant lead exposure reductions, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Methods to increase the distance between run-up areas and public areas on or off the airport and recommendations for how an airport operator may increase the size of run-up areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanisms to eliminate the cast-off of leaded aviation gasoline, which must include the provision of a container for the deposit of unwanted gasoline from preflight sampling, and education and signage to inform airport users of the prohibition on spilling unwanted sampled gasoline on the ground; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The establishment of standardized time limits on airport engine run-up and idling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the lead exposure reduction provisions included in subsection (2) of this section, the department of transportation may include in the initial or updated guidance other high-priority actions to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Minimize airport employee exposures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimize releases of leaded aviation gasoline caused by refueling and maintenance activities at the airport, including processes used to store and dispense aviation gasoline at the airport; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate and financially incentivize airport fuel consumers that have the option to purchase and use unleaded aviation gasoline at the airport to do so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By November 1, 2024, or within four months of the initial publication of guidance by the department under section 3 of this act, whichever is later, each airport operator must submit to the pertinent air quality regulator and begin implementing a plan to implement best practices identified by the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine designed to minimize environmental impacts and public health risks associated with leaded aviation gasoline use at general aviation airports. Each airport operator must update its plan by the November 1st following an updated publication of the guidance issued under section 3 of this act. At a minimum, each airport operator must include in its plan:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of how the airport operator plans to implement the operational and logistical contents of the guidance issued under section 3 of this act, including a description of how the airport operator will ensure that airport users adhere to the standards established to reduce environmental and public health exposures to lead; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A plan and budget for the financing of any needed fueling infrastructure improvements at the airport to allow for the airport to begin supplying unleaded aviation gasoline.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2025, and each December 1st thereafter, each airport operator must provide a brief status report to the pertinent air quality regulator regarding its implementation of the plan under this section, including the status of planning and investments to facilitate the supply of unleaded aviation gasoline at the airport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirements of this section do not apply to the operator of an airport at which leaded aviation gasoline is not sold, distributed, or otherwise made available. An airport operator at which leaded aviation gasoline ceases to be sold, distributed, or otherwise made available must notify the pertinent air quality regulator within 30 days of the cessation of the use of leaded aviation gasoline at the airport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An airport operator may temporarily suspend the implementation of the guidance under this section in the event of a federal, state, or local declaration of an emergency or a disaster.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The pertinent air quality regulator, in consultation with the department of transportation and the department of health, must offer technical assistance consistent with RCW 43.21A.085 and 43.21A.087 to a person that has not submitted a plan that meets the requirements of section 4 of this act or that does not implement the plan submitted to the department under section 4 of this act in the manner described in the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may adopt rules to implement, administer, and enforce the requirements of this section. An air pollution control authority formed under chapter 70A.15 RCW must enforce the requirements of this chapter in areas within its jurisdiction and the department must enforce the requirements of this chapter in areas of the state in which no air pollution control authority has been formed under chapter 70A.15 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who remains in violation of the requirements of section 4 of this act 30 days after the offer of technical assistance under subsection (1) of this section is subject to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per day of continued noncompliance. In setting penalties, the pertinent air quality regulator may consider the proximity of the airport to overburdened communities identified by the department or vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department must update its blood lead testing guidance for health care providers related to children living near airports at which aviation gasoline is used. The update must include children at risk of lead exposure due to airport operations among the high-risk populations broadly recommended for a blood lead test, without respect to the clinical judgment of the health care provider. For purposes of determining which children are at highest risk of lead exposure due to airport operations, the department must consider including children living, attending day care, preschool, or school within one kilometer of a general aviation airport, among other populations. The department must conduct outreach with and provide information to health care providers about the guidance.</p>
<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<p>An activated authority has a duty to enforce the requirements of chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 10 of this act) in the areas within its jurisdiction.</p>
