<p>The consequences of minimal economic activity and persistent unemployment and underemployment are serious threats to the safety, health, and welfare of residents of these areas, decreasing the value of private investments and jeopardizing the sources of public revenue.</p>

<p>The economic and social interdependence of communities and the vitality of industrial and economic activity necessitates, and is in part dependent on preventing substantial dislocation of residents and rebuilding the diversification of the areas' economy.</p>

<p>The ability to remedy problems in stagnant areas of the state is beyond the power and control of the regulatory process and influence of the state, and the ordinary operations of private enterprise without additional governmental assistance are insufficient to adequately remedy the problems of poverty and unemployment.</p>

<p>To support the implementation of RCW 47.04.280 and 47.01.078(4), the department shall adopt broad statewide goals to reduce annual per capita vehicle miles traveled by 2050 consistent with the stated goals of executive order 07-02. Consistent with these goals, the department shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Establish the following benchmarks using a statewide baseline of seventy-five billion vehicle miles traveled less the vehicle miles traveled attributable to vehicles licensed under RCW 46.16A.455 and weighing ten thousand pounds or more, which are exempt from this section:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Decrease the annual per capita vehicle miles traveled by eighteen percent by 2020;</p>

<li>
<p>Decrease the annual per capita vehicle miles traveled by thirty percent by 2035; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decrease the annual per capita vehicle miles traveled by fifty percent by 2050;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2008, establish and convene a collaborative process to develop a set of tools and best practices to assist state, regional, and local entities in making progress towards the benchmarks established in (a) of this subsection . The collaborative process must provide an opportunity for public review and comment and must:</p>

<p>Be jointly facilitated by the department, the department of ecology, and the department of commerce;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for participation from regional transportation planning organizations, the Washington state transit association, the Puget Sound clean air agency, a statewide business organization representing the sale of motor vehicles, at least one major private employer that participates in the commute trip reduction program, and other interested parties, including but not limited to parties representing diverse perspectives on issues relating to growth, development, and transportation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify current strategies to reduce vehicle miles traveled in the state as well as successful strategies in other jurisdictions that may be applicable in the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify potential new revenue options for local and regional governments to authorize to finance vehicle miles traveled reduction efforts;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for the development of measurement tools that can, with a high level of confidence, measure annual progress toward the benchmarks at the local, regional, and state levels, measure the effects of strategies implemented to reduce vehicle miles traveled and adequately distinguish between common travel purposes, such as moving freight or commuting to work, and measure trends of vehicle miles traveled per capita on a five-year basis;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>Establish a process for the department to periodically evaluate progress toward the vehicle miles traveled benchmarks, measure achieved and projected emissions reductions, and recommend whether the benchmarks should be adjusted to meet the state's overall goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;</p>

<li>
<p>Estimate the projected reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if the benchmarks are achieved, taking into account the expected implementation of existing state and federal mandates for vehicle technology and fuels, as well as expected growth in population and vehicle travel;</p>
