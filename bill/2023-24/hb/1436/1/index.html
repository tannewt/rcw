<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that students receiving special education services are entitled, under both federal and state law, to a full and appropriate education that enables their full participation. Further, the legislature finds that special education is fully part of the state's statutory program of basic education that is deemed by the legislature to implement Article IX, section 1 of the state Constitution.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that capping the number of students receiving disability services that a school district may receive state funding for is not consistent with the state's duty to provide a full and appropriate education. The legislature further finds that school districts have been paying for special education services with local funding, creating an inequitable situation for school districts and students. The legislature supports a system of funding that does not leave school districts liable to generate local funding to meet their obligation to provide special education services.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that along with reliable and sufficient state funding, supporting students receiving special education services to be in the least restrictive environment possible is crucial to their success. A recent large-scale study found that students who spend at least 80 percent of their day in a general education setting improved their reading scores by 24 points and math scores by 18 points compared to peers with similar disabilities. Building on investments made in the past few years, the legislature further finds that professional development in support of inclusionary practices within a multitiered system of supports is needed to continue making progress towards greater student inclusion in Washington state.</p>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to fully fund special education services in Washington state by removing the 13.5 percent cap and increase the special education multipliers, including the prekindergarten multiplier and the tiered K-12 multiplier, to give every school district a funding increase. The removal of the cap will make it unnecessary for school districts to apply for community impact relief through safety net funding. Further, the legislature directs the office of the superintendent of public instruction to create a new funding system to address still prevalent funding gaps in school districts with extraordinary high costs.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall submit to each regular session of the legislature during an odd-numbered year a programmed budget request for special education programs for students with disabilities. Funding for programs operated by local school districts shall be on an excess cost basis from appropriations provided by the legislature for special education programs for students with disabilities and shall take account of state funds accruing through RCW 28A.150.260 (4)(a), (5), (6), and (8) and 28A.150.415.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The excess cost allocation to school districts shall be based on the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A district's annual average headcount enrollment of students ages three and four and those five year olds not yet enrolled in kindergarten who are eligible for and receiving special education, multiplied by the district's base allocation per full-time equivalent student, multiplied by the special education cost multiplier rate of:</p>

In adopting and revising the rules, the superintendent shall ensure the application process to access safety net funding is streamlined, timelines for submission are not in conflict, feedback to school districts is timely and provides sufficient information to allow school districts to understand how to correct any deficiencies in a safety net application, and that there is consistency between awards approved by school district and by application period. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall also provide technical assistance to school districts in preparing and submitting special education safety net applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On an annual basis, the superintendent shall survey districts regarding their satisfaction with the safety net process and consider feedback from districts to improve the safety net process. Each year by December 1st, the superintendent shall prepare and submit a report to the office of financial management and the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature that summarizes the survey results and those changes made to the safety net process as a result of the school district feedback.</p>
