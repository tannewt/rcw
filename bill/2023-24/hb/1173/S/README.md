    a. The requirements of this section apply beginning January 1, 2026, to utility-scale wind energy facilities that have received site certification under chapter 80.50 RCW or all applicable land use, environmental, and building permits from state agencies and local governments prior to the effective date of this section.

    c. If the department obtains information that a facility is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, the department must issue a notification letter by certified mail to the facility owner or operator and offer information or other appropriate assistance regarding compliance with this chapter. If compliance is not achieved within 60 days of the issuance of a notification letter under this subsection, the department may assess penalties under this section.

    d. A utility-scale wind energy facility owner or operator specified in section 2(3)(a) of this act that applies for the approval of an aircraft detection lighting system to the federal aviation administration prior to January 1, 2025, but that has not received a determination to approve the aircraft detection lighting system by the federal aviation administration as of July 1, 2026, may not be assessed a penalty under this chapter until at least six months after the federal aviation administration issues its determination on the application of the utility-scale wind energy facility's proposed aircraft detection lighting system.
