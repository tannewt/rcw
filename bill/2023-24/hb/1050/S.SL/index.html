The awarding agency and municipality must report the apprenticeship utilization by contractor and subcontractor to the supervisor of apprenticeship at the department of labor and industries by final project acceptance. The electronic reporting system that is being developed by the department of labor and industries may be used for either or both monitoring and reporting apprenticeship utilization hours.</p>

The department of labor and industries must study and report on public works project outcomes related to apprenticeship utilization requirements, access to apprentices, and participation by small, women, minority, and veteran-owned businesses. The study and report must include projects completed between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2025, as well as projects in progress as of June 30, 2025, for in progress projects that have available data. Municipal projects with a bid due date before July 1, 2024, are not included in the study, except for data provided under (e) of this subsection. At a minimum, the study and report must:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>Include total project cost, total labor costs, the ratio of labor costs to total costs, apprentice hours worked by craft and percent of total hours worked, cost savings or increases from utilizing apprentices, number of projects achieving and not achieving apprentice utilization requirements, number of projects waiving apprentice utilization requirements for good faith efforts or other criteria deemed appropriate by the awarding agency with the reasons for the waivers, and the number and percentages of women, minority, and veteran-owned businesses as prime contractors or subcontractors and whether they utilized apprentices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include, by craft, the number and service area of construction apprenticeship programs, the number of training agents, and the number of construction apprentices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the number of small, women, minority, and veteran-owned businesses performing work on public works projects as a prime contractor or subcontractor, and utilization of apprentices on those projects, and provide information on how small, women, minority, and veteran-owned businesses may access apprentices on public works projects and examine any barriers to registered apprenticeship and apprentices.
