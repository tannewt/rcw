# HB 1699 - Fish & wildlife salaries

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1699.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the Washington fish and wildlife commission provides an important service to the state of Washington by protecting and preserving wildlife, fish, and habitat. The commission also provides sustainable fish and wildlife recreational and commercial opportunities that have significant impacts on local economies through sporting and tourism endeavors. In order to carry out these important duties, appointed commissioners must make difficult sacrifices as they volunteer their time and energy. Unfortunately, not all Washingtonians have the opportunity to dedicate the time and resources necessary to serve in this position and, therefore, they may be unable to accept a nomination. This makes the commission less representative and leaves out valuable voices from across all regions of the state.

Therefore, the legislature intends to provide a salary to the fish and wildlife commissioners in an effort to reduce the burdens placed on the commissioners and create a more inclusive and representative commission.

## Section 2
The commission shall hold at least one regular meeting during the first two months of each calendar quarter, and special meetings when called by the chair and by five members. Five members constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

The commission at a meeting in each odd-numbered year shall elect one of its members as chair and another member as vice chair, each of whom shall serve for a term of two years or until a successor is elected and qualified.

The annual salary for members of the commission shall be established by the Washington citizens' commission on salaries for elected officials. In addition, members are allowed their travel expenses incurred while absent from their usual places of residence in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060.

## Section 3
1. The citizens' commission on salaries for elected officials shall study the relationship of salaries to the duties of members of the legislature, all elected officials of the executive branch of state government,  all judges of the supreme court, court of appeals, superior courts, and district courts, and members of the Washington fish and wildlife commission, and shall fix the salary for each respective position.

2. Except as provided otherwise in RCW 43.03.305 and this section, the commission shall be solely responsible for its own organization, operation, and action and shall enjoy the fullest cooperation of all state officials, departments, and agencies.

3. Members of the commission shall receive no compensation for their services, but shall be eligible to receive a subsistence allowance and travel expenses pursuant to RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060.

4. The members of the commission shall elect a chair from among their number. The commission shall set a schedule of salaries by an affirmative vote of not less than nine members of the commission.

5. The commission shall file its initial schedule of salaries for the elected officials with the secretary of state no later than the first Monday in June, 1987, and shall file a schedule biennially thereafter. Each such schedule shall be filed in legislative bill form, shall be assigned a chapter number and published with the session laws of the legislature, and shall be codified by the statute law committee. The signature of the chair of the commission shall be affixed to each schedule submitted to the secretary of state. The chair shall certify that the schedule has been adopted in accordance with the provisions of state law and with the rules, if any, of the commission. Such schedules shall become effective ninety days after the filing thereof, except as provided in Article XXVIII, section 1 of the state Constitution. State laws regarding referendum petitions shall apply to such schedules to the extent consistent with Article XXVIII, section 1 of the state Constitution.

6. Before the filing of any salary schedule, the commission shall first develop a proposed salary schedule and then hold no fewer than four regular meetings as defined by chapter 42.30 RCW to take public testimony on the proposed schedule within the four months immediately preceding the filing. In the 2009-2011 fiscal biennium, the commission shall hold no more than two regular meetings as defined by chapter 42.30 RCW to take public testimony on the proposed schedule within the four months immediately preceding the filing. At the last public hearing that is held as a regular meeting on the proposed schedule, the commission shall adopt the salary schedule as originally proposed or as amended at that meeting that will be filed with the secretary of state.

7. All meetings, actions, hearings, and business of the commission shall be subject in full to the open public meetings act, chapter 42.30 RCW.

8. Salaries of the officials referred to in subsection (1) of this section that are in effect on January 12, 1987, shall continue until modified by the commission under this section.
