        i. For electronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within three business days of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination.

        ii. For electronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within one business day of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination.

    c. In any instance in which a carrier has determined that a provider or facility has not provided sufficient information for making a determination under (a) and (b) of this subsection, a carrier may establish a specific reasonable time frame for submission of the additional information. This time frame must be communicated to the provider or enrollee with a carrier's request for additional information.

    d. The carrier's prior authorization requirements must be described in detail and written in easily understandable language. The carrier shall make its most current prior authorization requirements and restrictions, including the written clinical review criteria, available to providers and facilities in an electronic format upon request.

    a. "Expedited prior authorization request" means a request by a provider or facility for approval of a health care service where the passage of time could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee, seriously jeopardize the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function, or, in the opinion of a provider or facility with knowledge of the enrollee's medical condition, would subject the enrollee to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the health care service that is the subject of the request.

    b. "Standard prior authorization request" means a request by a provider or facility for approval of a health care service where the request is made in advance of the enrollee obtaining a health care service that is not required to be expedited.
