<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the COVID-19 public health emergency pushed our health care system to the edge and health care providers across Washington state were challenged to continue providing high quality care with insufficient resources including an insufficient supply of health care practitioners. To address this challenge, from March of 2020 through October of 2022, physician assistants were permitted under governor Inslee's proclamation 20-32 to work without a delegation agreement signed by a supervising physician. During the public health emergency, physician assistants provided safe and efficient care, expanding access to necessary services and procedures statewide. The legislature also finds that prior to and following the public health emergency, there was, and continues to be, a great need for additional providers in primary care and specialty areas, especially in underserved and rural communities. Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize physician assistants to enter into collaborative practice with physicians to provide team-based care and enhance access to health care for the people of the state.</p>
