<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state's 132 public use airports contribute over 400,000 jobs, $26,800,000,000 in labor income, and $107,000,000,000 in total economic impact to our state's economy and communities. The legislature also finds that in order to maintain and expand the economic benefits Washington state derives from aviation and aerospace, the state must remain competitive nationally and globally to attract and retain new businesses and encourage investment at public use airports. The preferences in this act will assist both the existing mature aerospace industry and also emerging aviation technology companies leading the next era of aircraft propulsion and sustainability.</p>

<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (this act).

It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as one intended to improve industry competitiveness, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(b).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide short-term relief from taxes to incentivize new business development at public use airports. The objective is also to maintain Washington state's national competitiveness in the aviation and aerospace markets, to encourage the construction of hangars and associated infrastructure to assist in addressing the backlog for general aviation, and to attract and retain emerging aeronautics technology companies to the state and bring business to underutilized airports and rural communities.</p>
