If such substitute is paid by the authority, no deduction shall be made from the salary of the certificated or classified employee.

</ol>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Develop school employee benefit plans that include comprehensive, evidence-based health care benefits for school employees. In developing these plans, the school employees' benefits board shall consider the following elements:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Methods of maximizing cost containment while ensuring access to quality health care;</p>

<li>
<p>Development of provider arrangements that encourage cost containment and ensure access to quality care including, but not limited to, prepaid delivery systems and prospective payment methods;</p>

<ol type="i" start="6">

</li>
<li>

<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The benefits eligibility criteria, but the school employees' benefits board's criteria shall be no more restrictive than requiring that a school employee be anticipated to work at least 630 hours per school year to be benefits eligible, and must allow for the following:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) School employees anticipated to work less than 630 hours in any single school employees' benefits board organization may establish eligibility for benefits by working for more than one school employees' benefits board organization if the combined hours the school employee is anticipated to work is at least 630 hours per school year. Employer contributions for an employee eligible under this subsection (6)(d)(ii) shall be prorated across the employee's school employees' benefits board organizations based on data reported under RCW 28A.400.275. For employers establishing less restrictive local eligibility criteria under (e) of this subsection, employer contributions shall not be prorated;</p>
<p>(B) A school employee who gained benefits eligibility during a school year and who is returning in the following school year, shall be presumed eligible for benefits for the following school year if the school employee's schedule has not changed such that the school employee would no longer work at least 630 hours in the school year; and</p>
<p>(C) In determining how many hours a school employee is anticipated to work in the school year, all hours for which a school employee is anticipated to receive compensation from any school employees' benefits board organization during an approved leave period or a paid holiday must be included; and</p>
<pre><code>    iii. Coverage for dependents, including criteria for legal spouses; children up to age 26; children of any age with disabilities, mental illness, or intellectual or other developmental disabilities; and state registered domestic partners, as defined in RCW 26.60.020, and others authorized by the legislature;

e. Establish terms and conditions for a school employees' benefits board organization to have the ability to locally negotiate eligibility criteria for a school employee who is anticipated to work less than 630 hours in a school year. A school employees' benefits board organization that elects to use a lower threshold of hours for benefits eligibility must use benefits authorized by the school employees' benefits board and shall do so as an enrichment to the state's definition of basic education;

f. Establish penalties to be imposed when a school employees' benefits board organization fails to comply with established participation criteria; and

g. Participate with the authority in the preparation of specifications and selection of carriers contracted for school employee benefit plan coverage of eligible school employees in accordance with the criteria set forth in rules. To the extent possible, the school employees' benefits board shall leverage efficient purchasing by coordinating with the public employees' benefits board.
