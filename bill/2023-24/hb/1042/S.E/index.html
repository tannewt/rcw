<p>Code cities must adopt or amend by ordinance, and incorporate into their development regulations, zoning regulations, and other official controls the requirements of subsection (2) of this section by July 1, 2024.</p>

<p>Beginning July 1, 2024, the requirements of subsection (2) of this section apply and take effect in any code city that has not adopted or amended ordinances, regulations, or other official controls as required under this section and supersede, preempt, and invalidate any conflicting local development regulations.</p>

<p>Through ordinances, development regulations, zoning regulations, or other official controls as required under subsection (1) of this section, code cities may not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Impose a restriction on housing unit density that prevents the addition of housing units constructed entirely within an existing building envelope in a building located within a zone that permits multifamily housing, provided that generally applicable health and safety standards, including but not limited to building code standards and fire and life safety standards, can be met within the building;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impose parking requirements on the addition of dwelling units or living units added within an existing building;</p>

<li>
<p>Deny a building permit application for the addition of housing units to an existing building due to the nonconformity of the existing structure including, but not limited to, nonconformity regarding parking, height, setbacks, elevator size for gurney transport, or modulation, unless the legislative authority of the code city makes written findings that the nonconformity is causing a significant detriment to the surrounding area; or</p>
