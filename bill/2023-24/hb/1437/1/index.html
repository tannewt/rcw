<p>The purpose of this compact is to reduce the burdens on state governments and to facilitate the interstate practice and regulation of massage therapy with the goal of improving public access to, and the safety of, massage therapy services. Through this compact, the member states seek to establish a regulatory framework which provides for a new multistate licensing program. Through this additional licensing pathway, the member states seek to provide increased value and mobility to licensed massage therapists in the member states, while ensuring the provision of safe, competent, and reliable services to the public.</p>
<p>This compact is designed to achieve the following objectives, and the member states hereby ratify the same intentions by subscribing hereto:</p>

<p>Increase public access to massage therapy services by providing for a multistate licensing pathway;</p>
</li>

The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.
