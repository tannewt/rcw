<p>The legislature recognizes that there is a critical shortage of health care providers in Washington. The legislature also finds it essential that Washington students, especially low-income students and students of color, have the necessary credentials to secure high-demand jobs. The legislature intends to create this act to expand access to education and registered nurse career pathways.</p>
