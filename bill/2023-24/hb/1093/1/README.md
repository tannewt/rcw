# HB 1093 - K-12 scholarship program

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1093.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that:

    a. According to the Washington Constitution, it is "the paramount duty" of the state government to make "ample provision" for the basic education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, economic status, or sex;

    b. Test scores and other standard measurements of student achievement indicate that Washington's elementary and secondary students are struggling and their proficiency in basic skills, particularly in reading and mathematics, has been in decline for several years;

    c. Parents are and should be the primary decision makers about their children's well-being, including about what is best for their children's education;

    d. The state should empower and support families to choose the educational environment that best suits each student's needs;

    e. The state has authorized various education options, including traditional public schools, charter schools, home-based instruction, and private schools. However an inequity remains, families with greater financial means can choose from among these options, while families that do not have such means cannot. This inequity traps some students in failing schools or schools that do not meet their needs; and

    f. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has made the societal cost of this inequity plain and apparent.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a more equitable funding program that empowers families to make choices while providing greater educational equity, enrichment, and achievement. This program will use a system of scholarship moneys to assure a uniform quality education for all of Washington's elementary and secondary students.

## Section 2
1. The family empowerment scholarship program is established. The goal of the program is to empower families to choose an educational environment and program that will prepare their students for postsecondary education, gainful employment or entrepreneurship, and a successful future, regardless of the parents' income level or zip code, by providing funding that includes only those minimum state controls necessary to ensure the proper administration of the program.

2. The council must administer the program in accordance with this section and section 3 of this act.

3. To apply for the program, the parent of an eligible student must submit an application to the council in the manner and by the deadline set by the council.

4. The council must annually award 100,000 scholarships of $12,000 each on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority for participating students whose agreement is automatically renewed under subsection (6) of this section.

5. To participate in the program and receive a scholarship award, the parent of an eligible student must sign, and submit to the council, an agreement that obligates the parent to:

    a. Home-school the participating student in compliance with the home-based instruction requirements of RCW 28A.225.010 and 28A.200.010, or enroll the participating student in a private school;

    b. [Empty]

6. Agreements signed and submitted to the council automatically renew annually unless:

    a. The parent of a participating student submits a request in writing to the council to withdraw from the program or fails to comply with the provisions of the agreement. The termination of an agreement due to a failure to comply with its provisions must be based on a willful disregard of program requirements and may not be based upon a good-faith error by a parent;

    b. The participating student graduates from high school or earns a high school equivalency certificate under RCW 28B.50.536; or

    c. The participating student is ineligible to attend a public school in the state.

    c. A private school shall not be required to alter its creed, practices, admissions policy, or curriculum in order to accept participating students whose parents pay tuition or fees from a scholarship award under this act.

    d. In any legal proceeding challenging the application of this act to a private school, the state bears the burden of establishing that the law is necessary and does not impose any undue burden on private schools or home-based instruction.
