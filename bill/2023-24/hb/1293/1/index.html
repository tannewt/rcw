<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this section is to accommodate infill and housing development and thereby realize the goals and policies of comprehensive plans adopted according to chapter 36.70A RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city or county planning under RCW 36.70A.040 is authorized by this section to establish categorical exemptions from the requirements of this chapter.  An exemption may be adopted by a city or county under this subsection if it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It categorically exempts government action related to development proposed to fill in an urban growth area, designated according to RCW 36.70A.110, where current density and intensity of use in the area is roughly equal to or lower than called for in the goals and policies of the applicable comprehensive plan and the development is either:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Residential development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixed-use development; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commercial development up to 65,000 square feet, excluding retail development;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does not exempt government action related to development that is inconsistent with the applicable comprehensive plan or would clearly exceed the density or intensity of use called for in the goals and policies of the applicable comprehensive plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local government considers the specific probable adverse environmental impacts of the proposed action and determines that these specific impacts are adequately addressed by the development regulations or other applicable requirements of the comprehensive plan, subarea plan element of the comprehensive plan, planned action ordinance, or other local, state, or federal rules or laws; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The city or county's applicable comprehensive plan was previously subjected to environmental analysis through an environmental impact statement under the requirements of this chapter prior to adoption; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county has prepared an environmental impact statement that considers the proposed use or density and intensity of use in the area proposed for an exemption under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All project actions that propose to develop one or more residential housing units within an urban growth area designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110 shall be categorically exempt from the requirements of this chapter. A project action shall be eligible for categorical exemption under this subsection only if it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The proposed development is not inconsistent with an applicable comprehensive plan adopted according to chapter 36.70A RCW by the jurisdiction in which the development is proposed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposed development would not exceed the density or intensity of use called for in the goals and policies of that applicable comprehensive plan; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The city or county's applicable comprehensive plan was previously subjected to environmental analysis through an environmental impact statement under the requirements of this chapter prior to adoption; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city or county has prepared an environmental impact statement that considers the proposed use or density and intensity of use in the area proposed for an exemption under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any categorical exemption under this section applies even if it differs from the categorical exemptions adopted by rule of the department under RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a). However, any categorical exemption  under this section shall be subject to the rules of the department adopted according to RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a) that provide exceptions to the use of categorical exemptions adopted by the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;design review&quot; means a formally adopted local government process by which projects are reviewed for compliance with design standards for the type of use adopted through local ordinance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, counties and cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may apply in any design review process only clear and objective development regulations governing the exterior design of new development. For purposes of this section, a clear and objective development regulation:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Must include one or more ascertainable guideline, standard, or criterion by which an applicant can determine whether a given building design is permissible under that development regulation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May not have the effect, either alone or together with other development regulations, of discouraging needed housing through unreasonable cost, delay, or uncertainty.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of subsection (2) of this section do not apply to development regulations that apply only to structures listed in the Washington heritage register as described in RCW 27.34.220 or the national register of historic places as defined in the national historic preservation act of 1966 (Title 1, Sec. 101, Public Law 89-665; 80 Stat. 915; 16 U.S.C. Sec. 470) as now or hereafter amended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any design review process must be conducted concurrently, or otherwise logically integrated, with the consolidated review and decision process for project permits set forth in RCW 36.70B.120(3), and no design review process may include more than one public meeting within the meaning of RCW 36.70B.020.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each local government is encouraged to adopt further project review provisions to provide prompt, coordinated and objective review and ensure accountability to applicants and the public, including expedited review for project permit applications for projects that are consistent with adopted development regulations and within the capacity of systemwide infrastructure improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter is intended or shall be construed to prevent a local government from requiring a preapplication conference or a public meeting by rule, ordinance, or resolution, where otherwise permitted by applicable state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each local government shall adopt procedures to monitor and enforce permit decisions and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter modifies any independent statutory authority for a government agency to appeal a project permit issued by a local government.</p>
</li>
</ol>
