# HB 1515 - Behavioral health contracts

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1515.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Medicaid enrollees in Washington lack sufficient access to needed behavioral health care. According to the Washington state department of social and health services, as of 2021, among medicaid enrollees with an identified mental health need, only 50 percent of adults and 66 percent of youth received treatment, while among medicaid enrollees with an identified substance use disorder need, only 37 percent of adults and 23 percent of youth received treatment. Furthermore, the national council for mental wellbeing's 2022 access to care survey found that 43 percent of adults in the United States who say they need mental health or substance use care did not receive that care, and they face numerous barriers to receiving needed treatment. Lack of necessary care can cause behavioral health conditions to deteriorate and crises to escalate, driving increasing use of intensive services such as inpatient care and involuntary treatment. As a result, the behavioral health system is reaching a crisis point in communities across the state.

    b. As of December 2022, 1,953,153 Washington residents rely on apple health managed care organizations to provide for their physical and behavioral health needs. During the integration of physical and behavioral health care pursuant to chapter 225, Laws of 2014, the health care authority most recently procured managed care services in 2018 and selected five managed care organizations to serve as Washington's apple health plans to provide for the physical and behavioral health care needs of medicaid enrollees. The health care authority has begun planning to open a new procurement for managed care organizations, including an allowance for possible new entrants that do not currently serve Washington's medicaid population.

    c. Medicaid managed care procurement presents a need and an opportunity for the state to reset expectations for managed care organizations related to behavioral health services to assure that Washington residents are being served by qualified and experienced health plans that can deliver on the access to care and quality of care that residents need and deserve.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to seize this opportunity to address ongoing challenges Washington's medicaid enrollees face in accessing behavioral health care. The legislature intends to establish robust new standards defining the levels of medicaid-funded behavioral health service capacity and resources that are adequate to meet medicaid enrollees' treatment needs; to assure that managed care organizations that serve Washington's medicaid enrollees have a track record of success in delivering a broad range of behavioral health care services to safety net populations; and to advance payment structures and provider network delivery models that improve equitable access, promote integration of care, and deliver on outcomes.

## Section 2
1. Any agreement or contract by the authority to provide behavioral health services as defined under RCW 71.24.025 to persons eligible for benefits under medicaid, Title XIX of the social security act, and to persons not eligible for medicaid must include the following:

    g. Standards related to the financial integrity of the contracting entity. This subsection does not limit the authority of the authority to take action under a contract upon finding that a contracting entity's financial status jeopardizes the contracting entity's ability to meet its contractual obligations;

    h. Mechanisms for monitoring performance under the contract and remedies for failure to substantially comply with the requirements of the contract including, but not limited to, financial deductions, termination of the contract, receivership, reprocurement of the contract, and injunctive remedies;

2. Before releasing a procurement under this section, and no later than July 1, 2024, the authority shall adopt regional standards for the behavioral health provider networks maintained by managed care organizations pursuant to subsection (1)(d) of this section.

    g. The ability to meet requirements established by the authority

; (h) Demonstrated commitment by managed care organizations to establish, continue, or expand a delegation arrangement with a provider network that leverages local, federal, or philanthropic funding to enhance the effectiveness of medicaid-funded integrated care services and promote medicaid clients' access to a system of services that addresses additional social support services and social determinants of health as defined in RCW 43.20.025 in a manner that is integrated with the delivery of behavioral health and medical treatment services, in any regional service area that has such a network, to provide services and perform provider network management functions for enrollees; and

        i. Demonstrated commitment by managed care organizations to the use of alternative pricing and payment structures between a managed care organization and its behavioral health services providers, including provider networks described in (h) of this subsection, in any of their agreements or contracts under this section, which may include but are not limited to:

        i. Value-based purchasing efforts consistent with the authority's value-based purchasing road map, such as capitated payment arrangements or case rate arrangements; or

        ii. Payment methods that secure a sufficient amount of ready and available capacity for levels of care that require staffing 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, to serve anyone in the regional service area with a demonstrated need for the service at all times, regardless of fluctuating utilization.

5. The authority may use existing cross-system outcome data such as the outcomes and related measures under subsection (4)(c) of this section and chapter 338, Laws of 2013, to determine that the alternative pricing and payment structures referenced in subsection (4)(h) of this section have advanced community behavioral health system outcomes more effectively than a fee-for-service model may have been expected to deliver.

6. The authority shall require each managed care organization participating in a procurement process under this section to demonstrate prior national or in-state experience with contracting and network development for a full continuum of behavioral health services that are substantially similar to the behavioral health services covered under the Washington medicaid state plan. At a minimum, this shall include experience contracting for crisis, outpatient, residential, withdrawal management, and inpatient behavioral health services, and shall include past and current data on performance, quality, and outcomes.

8. The authority shall expand the types of behavioral health crisis services that can be funded with medicaid to the maximum extent allowable under federal law, including seeking approval from the centers for medicare and medicaid services for amendments to the medicaid state plan or medicaid state directed payments that support the 24 hours per day, 365 days per year capacity of the crisis delivery system when necessary to achieve this expansion.
