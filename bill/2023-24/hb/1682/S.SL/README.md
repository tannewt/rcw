# HB 1682 - Auto theft authority account

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1682-S.SL.pdf)

## Section 1
The Washington auto theft prevention authority account was created in 2007 to provide dedicated funding from traffic infraction collections to support programs designed to prevent and prosecute motor vehicle theft. The legislature finds that over the years, funding from the account has been diverted to other nonauto theft uses such as department of corrections' operations and youth gang prevention programs. The legislature further finds that revenues from traffic infractions have decreased as more drivers access diversion and deferral programs designed to assist people with retaining their licenses. Fund diversions and decreasing traffic infraction revenue threaten the viability of motor vehicle theft prevention programs at a time when the number of motor vehicle thefts have increased 88 percent between the year 2021 and 2022. In order to provide more secure funding to combat and prevent motor vehicle theft, the legislature intends each fiscal year to deposit into the Washington auto theft prevention authority account $7,000,000 of insurance premium tax collections that would otherwise be deposited to the general fund and to have this deposit grow by inflation. The legislature further intends for moneys collected from the traffic infraction surcharge in RCW 46.63.110(7)(b) to be deposited into the state general fund.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. A person found to have committed a traffic infraction shall be assessed a monetary penalty. No penalty may exceed $250 for each offense unless authorized by this chapter or title.

    b. The court may waive or remit any monetary penalty, fee, cost, assessment, or other monetary obligation associated with a traffic infraction unless the specific monetary obligation in question is prohibited from being waived or remitted by state law.

2. The monetary penalty for a violation of (a) RCW 46.55.105(2) is $250 for each offense; (b) RCW 46.61.210(1) is $500 for each offense. No penalty assessed under this subsection (2) may be reduced.

3. The supreme court shall prescribe by rule a schedule of monetary penalties for designated traffic infractions. This rule shall also specify the conditions under which local courts may exercise discretion in assessing fines and penalties for traffic infractions. The legislature respectfully requests the supreme court to adjust this schedule every two years for inflation.

4. There shall be a penalty of $25 for failure to respond to a notice of traffic infraction except where the infraction relates to parking as defined by local law, ordinance, regulation, or resolution or failure to pay a monetary penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter. A local legislative body may set a monetary penalty not to exceed $25 for failure to respond to a notice of traffic infraction relating to parking as defined by local law, ordinance, regulation, or resolution. The local court, whether a municipal, police, or district court, shall impose the monetary penalty set by the local legislative body.

Monetary penalties provided for in chapter 46.70 RCW which are civil in nature and penalties which may be assessed for violations of chapter 46.44 RCW relating to size, weight, and load of motor vehicles are not subject to the limitation on the amount of monetary penalties which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.

6. Whenever a monetary penalty, fee, cost, assessment, or other monetary obligation is imposed by a court under this chapter, it is immediately payable and is enforceable as a civil judgment under Title 6 RCW. If the court determines that a person is not able to pay a monetary obligation in full, the court shall enter into a payment plan with the person in accordance with RCW 46.63.190 and standards that may be set out in court rule.

7. In addition to any other penalties imposed under this section and not subject to the limitation of subsection (1) of this section, a person found to have committed a traffic infraction shall be assessed:

    b. A fee of $10 per infraction. Under no circumstances shall this fee be reduced or waived. Revenue from this fee shall be forwarded to the state treasurer for deposit in the general fund; and

    c. A fee of $5 per infraction. Under no circumstances shall this fee be reduced or waived. Revenue from this fee shall be forwarded to the state treasurer for deposit in the traumatic brain injury account established in RCW 74.31.060.

8. [Empty]

    a. In addition to any other penalties imposed under this section and not subject to the limitation of subsection (1) of this section, a person found to have committed a traffic infraction other than of RCW 46.61.527 or 46.61.212 shall be assessed an additional penalty of $24. The court may not reduce, waive, or suspend the additional penalty unless the court finds the offender to be indigent. If a court authorized community restitution program for offenders is available in the jurisdiction, the court shall allow offenders to offset all or a part of the penalty due under this subsection (8) by participation in the court authorized community restitution program.

    b. $12.50 of the additional penalty under (a) of this subsection shall be remitted to the state treasurer.

Money remitted under this subsection to the state treasurer must be deposited as follows: $8.50 in the state general fund and $4 in the driver licensing technology support account created under RCW 46.68.067. The moneys deposited into the driver licensing technology support account must be used to support information technology systems used by the department to communicate with the judicial information system, manage driving records, and implement court orders. The balance of the revenue received by the county or city treasurer under this subsection must be deposited into the county or city current expense fund. Moneys retained by the city or county under this subsection shall constitute reimbursement for any liabilities under RCW 43.135.060.

9. If a legal proceeding, such as garnishment, has commenced to collect any delinquent amount owed by the person for any penalty imposed by the court under this section, the person may request a payment plan pursuant to RCW 46.63.190.

10. The monetary penalty for violating RCW 46.37.395 is: (a) $250 for the first violation; (b) $500 for the second violation; and (c) $750 for each violation thereafter.

11. The additional monetary penalty for a violation of RCW 46.20.500 is not subject to assessments or fees provided under this section.

Subject to other provisions of this chapter, each authorized insurer except title insurers and registered eligible captive insurers as defined in RCW 48.201.020 shall on or before the first day of March of each year pay to the state treasurer through the commissioner's office a tax on premiums. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, such tax shall be in the amount of two percent of all premiums, excluding amounts returned to or the amount of reductions in premiums allowed to holders of industrial life policies for payment of premiums directly to an office of the insurer, collected or received by the insurer under RCW 48.14.090 during the preceding calendar year other than ocean marine and foreign trade insurances, after deducting premiums paid to policyholders as returned premiums, upon risks or property resident, situated, or to be performed in this state.

    b. Beginning July 1, 2023, and July 1st of each year thereafter, the state treasurer shall deposit $7,000,000 in moneys collected for premium taxes pursuant to this section into the Washington auto theft prevention authority account created in RCW 46.66.080. Beginning July 1, 2023, the amount deposited under this subsection must be adjusted by the most current seasonally adjusted index of the consumer price index for all urban consumers as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor.

3. In the case of insurers which require the payment by their policyholders at the inception of their policies of the entire premium thereon in the form of premiums or premium deposits which are the same in amount, based on the character of the risks, regardless of the length of term for which such policies are written, such tax shall be in the amount of two percent of the gross amount of such premiums and premium deposits upon policies on risks resident, located, or to be performed in this state, in force as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding, less the unused or unabsorbed portion of such premiums and premium deposits computed at the average rate thereof actually paid or credited to policyholders or applied in part payment of any renewal premiums or premium deposits on one-year policies expiring during such year.

Such gross underwriting profit shall be ascertained by deducting from the net premiums (i.e., gross premiums less all return premiums and premiums for reinsurance) on such ocean marine and foreign trade insurance contracts the net losses paid (i.e., gross losses paid less salvage and recoveries on reinsurance ceded) during such calendar year under such contracts. In the case of insurers issuing participating contracts, such gross underwriting profit shall not include, for computation of the tax prescribed by this subsection, the amounts refunded, or paid as participation dividends, by such insurers to the holders of such contracts.
