# HB 1729 - Hydrogen fuel products

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1729.pdf)

## Section 1
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2, 3, and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 2, 3, and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, improve industry competitiveness, and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a), (b), and (c).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage hydrogen fuel product research, development, manufacture, and sale in Washington to advance hydrogen fuel product technology, production, and adoption in the state.

4. If a review finds that the number of businesses in this state focused on hydrogen fuel product research, development, manufacture, or sale has increased as measured by the number of businesses claiming the tax preferences in this act, or that Washington businesses focused on hydrogen fuel product research, development, and manufacturing in the state have made advancements in hydrogen fuel product technology, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of these tax preferences.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may access and use any relevant data collected by the state.

## Section 2

    a. Beginning January 1, 2024, upon every person engaging within this state in the business of manufacturing hydrogen fuel products, as to such persons the amount of tax with respect to such business is, in the case of manufacturers, equal to the value of the product manufactured, or in the case of processors for hire, equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate of 0.2904 percent.

    b. Beginning January 1, 2024, upon every person engaging within this state in the business of making sales, at retail or wholesale, of hydrogen fuel products manufactured by the seller, as to such persons the amount of tax with respect to such business is equal to the gross proceeds of sales, multiplied by the rate of 0.2904 percent.

2. For purposes of this section, the definitions in this subsection apply.

    a. "Hydrogen electrolyzer" means a technology that uses an electrochemical reaction to generate hydrogen by combining water and electricity in the presence of a catalyst.

    b. "Hydrogen fuel cell" means a technology that uses an electrochemical reaction to generate electric energy by combining atoms of hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst.

3. This section expires January 1, 2035.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed for each person for qualified hydrogen fuel product development. For a person who is a manufacturer or processor for hire of hydrogen fuel products, credit may be earned for expenditures occurring after January 1, 2024.

    b. Any unused credits earned under this section may be accrued and carried forward.

2. The credit is equal to the amount of qualified hydrogen fuel product development expenditures of a person, multiplied by the rate of 1.75 percent.

3. Except as provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section, the credit under this section must be claimed against taxes due for the same calendar year in which the qualified hydrogen fuel product development expenditures are incurred. The credit for each calendar year may not exceed the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter for the calendar year. Refunds may not be granted in the place of a credit.

4. Any person claiming the credit must file an electronic form prescribed by the department that includes the amount of the credit claimed, an estimate of the anticipated hydrogen fuel product development expenditures during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, an estimate of the taxable amount during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, and such additional information as the department may prescribe. A person whose reporting period is less than annual must make an adjustment to the total credit claimed for the calendar year using the person's actual hydrogen fuel product development expenditures for the calendar year when the person files its last return for the calendar year for which the credit is claimed.

5. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

    a. "Hydrogen fuel product" has the same meaning as provided in section 2 of this act.

    b. [Empty]

(B) The discovery of technological information, the translating of technological information into new or improved products, processes, techniques, formulas, or inventions, and the adaptation of existing products into new products; and

(C) Tool design and engineering design for the manufacturing process.

        ii. "Hydrogen fuel product development" does not include:

(A) Surveys and studies, social science and humanities research, market research or testing, quality control, sale promotion and service, computer software developed for internal use, and research in peripheral areas; or

(B) Manufacturing activities or other production-oriented activities.

    c. "Qualified hydrogen fuel product development" means hydrogen fuel product development performed within this state.

    d. [Empty]

        i. "Qualified hydrogen fuel product development expenditures" means operating expenses, including wages, compensation of a proprietor or a partner in a partnership as determined by the department, benefits, supplies, and computer expenses, directly incurred in qualified hydrogen fuel product development by a person claiming the credit provided in this section.

        ii. "Qualified hydrogen fuel product development expenditures" does not include amounts paid to a person or to the state and any of its departments and institutions, other than a public educational or research institution to conduct qualified hydrogen fuel product development; or capital costs and overhead, such as expenses for land, structures, or depreciable property.

    e. "Taxable amount" means the taxable amount subject to the tax imposed in this chapter required to be reported on the person's tax returns during the year in which the credit is claimed, less any taxable amount for which a credit is allowed under RCW 82.04.440.
