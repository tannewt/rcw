<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 1, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (section 1 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to attract and retain renewable and clean hydrogen production facilities whose production outputs will be used in place of fossil fuel derived fuels and manufacturing feedstocks that they replace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To measure the effectiveness of the tax preference in section 1 of this act, the joint legislative audit and review committee must, using calendar year 2022 as the baseline, evaluate the annual volumetric quantity of renewable hydrogen and green electrolytic hydrogen produced in the state, as well as the annual percentage of hydrogen produced in the state that is either green electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the evaluation in subsection (4) of this section, the department of revenue must provide data needed for the joint legislative audit and review committee analysis. In addition to the data source described under this subsection, the joint legislative audit and review committee may use any other data it deems necessary.</p>
