<ol>
<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2 and 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 2 and 3 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers and reduce structural inefficiencies in the tax code, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a) and (d).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to reduce tax pyramiding during the manufacturing of broadband networks thereby enhancing industry competitiveness thereby improving structural inefficiencies in the tax structure. The legislature finds that pyramiding can cause inefficiencies by encouraging firms to move away from more heavily taxed goods, and increases the effective tax rate in a nontransparent way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To measure the effectiveness of the sales and use tax exemptions created in sections 2 and 3 of this act in achieving the public policy objectives described in this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate the number of businesses that claim the exemptions in sections 2 and 3 of this act for sales to a broadband communications services provider of machinery and equipment used in a communication network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may access and use any relevant data collected by the state and any other data it deems necessary in performing the evaluation under subsection (4) of this section.</p>

    ii. A gas distribution business claiming an exemption from state and local tax in the form of a remittance under this section must pay the tax under RCW 82.08.020 and all applicable local sales taxes.

The gas distribution business must retain, in adequate detail, records to enable the department to determine whether the business is entitled to an exemption under this section, including: Invoices; proof of tax paid; and documents describing the machinery and equipment.

    iii. The department must determine eligibility under this section based on the information provided by the gas distribution business, which is subject to audit verification by the department. The department must on a quarterly basis remit exempted amounts to qualifying businesses who submitted applications during the previous quarter.

    iv. Beginning July 1, 2028, a gas distribution business may not apply for a refund under this section or RCW 82.12.02565.
