2. Of the amounts appropriated to the program, 23 percent shall be provided solely for grants to nonprofit providers of special needs transportation.

3. The remaining 77 percent of amounts appropriated to the program shall be provided solely for grants to transit agencies to support persons with special transportation needs. To receive a grant, the transit agency must, to the greatest extent practicable, have a maintenance of effort for special needs transportation that is no less than the previous year's maintenance of effort for special needs transportation. Grants for transit agencies must be prorated based on the amount expended for demand response service and route deviates service published in the most recent publishing of the department's "Summary of Public Transportation" report. No transit agency shall receive more than 30 percent of the distribution.
