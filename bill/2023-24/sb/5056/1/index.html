<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds there to be a significant number of property crimes in Washington and that the current practices in the criminal justice system are ineffective in reducing recidivism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that a large portion of property crimes in Washington are committed by habitual offenders. Increasing the sanctions for habitual property offenders will provide more effective deterrents to recidivism. The legislature intends to enhance the courts' discretion to more appropriately sentence habitual property offenders with significant histories of burglary and theft.</p>
</li>
</ol>
