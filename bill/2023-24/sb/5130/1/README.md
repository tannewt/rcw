## Section 3
1. An agency or facility designated to monitor or provide less restrictive alternative treatment services under a court order or conditional release, or a designated crisis responder, may take action to enforce, modify, or revoke the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release if the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder determines that:

    a. The person is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of the order;

    b. Substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred;

    c. There is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further evaluation, intervention, or treatment; or

    d. The person poses a likelihood of serious harm.

2. Actions taken under this section must include a flexible range of responses of varying levels of intensity appropriate to the circumstances and consistent with the interests of the individual and the public in personal autonomy, safety, recovery, and compliance. Available actions may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

    a. To counsel or advise the person as to their rights and responsibilities under the court order, and to offer incentives to motivate compliance;

    b. To increase the intensity of outpatient services provided to the person by increasing the frequency of contacts with the provider, referring the person for an assessment for assertive community services, or by other means;

    c. To request a court hearing for review and modification of the court order. The request must be directed to the court with jurisdiction over the order and specify the circumstances that give rise to the request and what modification is being sought. The county prosecutor shall assist the entity requesting the hearing and issue an appropriate summons to the person. This subsection does not limit the inherent authority of a treatment provider to alter conditions of treatment for clinical reasons, and is intended to be used only when court intervention is necessary or advisable to secure the person's compliance and prevent decompensation or deterioration;

    d. To detain the person for up to 12 hours for evaluation at an agency, facility providing services under the court order, triage facility, crisis stabilization unit, emergency department, evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility with available space, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program with available space. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine whether modification, revocation, or commitment proceedings are necessary and appropriate to stabilize the person and prevent decompensation, deterioration, or physical harm. Temporary detention for evaluation under this subsection is intended to occur only following a pattern of noncompliance or the failure of reasonable attempts at outreach and engagement, and may occur only when, based on clinical judgment, temporary detention is appropriate. The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder may request assistance from a peace officer for the purposes of temporary detention under this subsection (2)(d). This subsection does not limit the ability or obligation of the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder to pursue revocation procedures under subsection (5) of this section in appropriate circumstances; and

    e. To initiate revocation procedures under subsection (5) of this section.

3. A court may supervise a person on an order for less restrictive alternative treatment or a conditional release. While the person is under the order, the court may:

    a. Require appearance in court for periodic reviews; and

    b. Modify the order after considering input from the agency or facility designated to provide or facilitate services. The court may not remand the person into inpatient treatment except as provided under subsection (5) of this section, but may take actions under subsection (2)(a) through (d) of this section.

4. The facility or agency designated to provide outpatient treatment shall notify the secretary of the department of social and health services or designated crisis responder when a person fails to adhere to terms and conditions of court ordered treatment or experiences substantial deterioration in his or her condition and, as a result, presents an increased likelihood of serious harm.

5. [Empty]

    a. A designated crisis responder or the secretary of the department of social and health services may, upon their own motion or upon request of the facility or agency designated to provide outpatient care, cause a person to be detained in an evaluation and treatment facility, available secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility with adequate space, or available approved substance use disorder treatment program with adequate space in or near the county in which he or she is receiving outpatient treatment for the purpose of a hearing for revocation of a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order under this chapter. The designated crisis responder or secretary of the department of social and health services shall file a petition for revocation within 24 hours and serve the person, their guardian, if any, and their attorney. A hearing for revocation of a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order may be scheduled without detention of the person.

    b. A person detained under this subsection (5) must be held until such time, not exceeding five days, as a hearing can be scheduled to determine whether or not the order for less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release should be revoked, modified, or retained. If the person is not detained, the hearing must be scheduled within five days of service on the person. The designated crisis responder or the secretary of the department of social and health services may withdraw its petition for revocation at any time before the court hearing.

    c. A person detained under this subsection (5) has the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as in any involuntary treatment proceeding, except as specifically set forth in this section. There is no right to jury trial. The venue for proceedings is the county where the petition is filed. Notice of the filing must be provided to the court that originally ordered commitment, if different from the court where the petition for revocation is filed, within two judicial days of the person's detention.

    d. The issues for the court to determine are whether: (i) The person adhered to the terms and conditions of the order or conditional release; (ii) substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred; (iii) there is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further inpatient treatment; or (iv) there is a likelihood of serious harm; and, if any of the above conditions apply, whether it is appropriate for the court to reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release  or order the person's detention for inpatient treatment. The person may waive the court hearing and allow the court to enter a stipulated order upon the agreement of all parties. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for 14 days from the revocation hearing if the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release  was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.148, 71.05.160, or 71.05.230. The person must return to less restrictive alternative treatment under the order at the end of the 14-day period unless a petition for further treatment is filed under RCW 71.05.320 or the person accepts voluntary treatment. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release  was based on a petition under RCW 71.05.290 or 71.05.320, the number of days remaining on the order must be converted to days of inpatient treatment. A court may not detain a person for inpatient treatment to a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program under this subsection unless there is a facility or program available with adequate space for the person.

6. In determining whether or not to take action under this section the designated crisis responder, agency, or facility must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.212 and the court must consider the factors specified under RCW 71.05.245 as they apply to the question of whether to enforce, modify, or revoke a court order for involuntary treatment.

    b. The minor is in need of evaluation and treatment of the type provided by the inpatient evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program to which continued inpatient care is sought or is in need of less restrictive alternative treatment found to be in the best interests of the minor or others; and

## Section 9
1. An agency or facility designated to monitor or provide less restrictive alternative treatment services to a minor under a court order or conditional release may take a range of actions to enforce the terms of the order or conditional release in the event the minor is not adhering to the terms or is experiencing substantial deterioration, decompensation, or a likelihood of serious harm. Such actions may include:

    a. Counseling the minor and offering incentives for compliance;

    b. Increasing the intensity of services;

    c. Petitioning the court to review the minor's compliance and optionally modify the terms of the order or conditional release while the minor remains in outpatient treatment;

    d. To request assistance from a peace officer for temporarily detaining the minor for up to 12 hours for evaluation at a crisis stabilization unit, evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, facility providing services under a court order, or emergency department to determine if revocation or enforcement proceedings under this section are necessary and appropriate to stabilize the minor, if there has been a pattern of noncompliance or failure of reasonable attempts at outreach and engagement; or

    e. Initiation of revocation proceedings under subsection (2) of this section.

2. If the professional person in charge of an outpatient treatment program, a designated crisis responder, or the director or secretary, as appropriate, determines that a minor is failing to adhere to the conditions of a court order for less restrictive alternative treatment or the conditions of a conditional release, or that substantial deterioration in the minor's functioning has occurred, the designated crisis responder, or the director or secretary, as appropriate, may order that the minor be taken into custody and transported to an inpatient evaluation and treatment facility, a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program. A secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program that has adequate space for the minor must be available.

3. [Empty]

    a. The designated crisis responder, director, or secretary, as appropriate, shall file the order of apprehension and detention and serve it upon the minor and notify the minor's parent and the minor's attorney, if any, of the detention within two days of return. At the time of service the minor shall be informed of the right to a hearing and to representation by an attorney. The designated crisis responder or the director or secretary, as appropriate, may modify or rescind the order of apprehension and detention at any time prior to the hearing.

    b. If the minor is involuntarily detained for revocation at an evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program in a different county from where the minor was initially detained, the facility or program may file the order of apprehension, serve it on the minor and notify the minor's parents and the minor's attorney at the request of the designated crisis responder.

4. A petition for revocation of less restrictive alternative treatment shall be filed by the designated crisis responder or the director, secretary, or facility, as appropriate, with the court in the county where the minor is detained. The court shall conduct the hearing in that county. A petition for revocation of conditional release must be filed in the county where the minor is detained. A petition shall describe the behavior of the minor indicating violation of the conditions or deterioration of routine functioning and a dispositional recommendation. The hearing shall be held within seven days of the minor's return. The issues to be determined are whether the minor did or did not adhere to the conditions of the less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release, or whether the minor's routine functioning has substantially deteriorated, and, if so, whether the conditions of less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release should be modified or, subject to subsection (5) of this section, whether the court should order the minor's detention for inpatient treatment. Pursuant to the determination of the court, the minor shall be returned to less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release on the same or modified conditions or shall be detained for inpatient treatment. If the minor is detained for inpatient treatment, RCW 71.34.760 regarding the director's placement responsibility shall apply. The hearing may be waived by the minor and the minor detained for inpatient treatment or returned to less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release on the same or modified conditions. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for 14 days from the revocation hearing if the less restrictive alternative treatment order was based on a petition under RCW 71.34.740 or 71.34.815. The minor must return to less restrictive alternative treatment under the order at the end of the 14-day period unless a petition for further treatment is filed under RCW 71.34.750 or the minor accepts voluntary treatment. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release was based on a petition under RCW 71.34.750, the number of days remaining on the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release must be converted to days of inpatient treatment.

5. A court may not order the placement of a minor to inpatient treatment in a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program unless there is a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program available with adequate space for the minor.

4. A petition for revocation of less restrictive alternative treatment shall be filed by the designated crisis responder or the director, secretary, or facility, as appropriate, with the court in the county where the minor is detained. The court shall conduct the hearing in that county. A petition for revocation of conditional release must be filed in the county where the minor is detained. A petition shall describe the behavior of the minor indicating violation of the conditions or deterioration of routine functioning and a dispositional recommendation. The hearing shall be held within seven days of the minor's return.

Pursuant to the determination of the court, the minor shall be returned to less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release on the same or modified conditions or shall be detained for inpatient treatment. If the minor is detained for inpatient treatment, RCW 71.34.760 regarding the director's placement responsibility shall apply. The hearing may be waived by the minor and the minor detained for inpatient treatment or returned to less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release on the same or modified conditions. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for 14 days from the revocation hearing if the less restrictive alternative treatment order was based on a petition under RCW 71.34.740 or 71.34.815. The minor must return to less restrictive alternative treatment under the order at the end of the 14-day period unless a petition for further treatment is filed under RCW 71.34.750 or the minor accepts voluntary treatment. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment and the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release was based on a petition under RCW 71.34.750, the number of days remaining on the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release must be converted to days of inpatient treatment.
