    b. Anticipated freight traffic demand, including freight traffic relief that may be afforded to existing highway routes by the creation of a third bridge;

    c. A cost-benefit analysis of constructing a third bridge, which must include analysis on the estimated cost to construct a third bridge;

    d. Potential locations for a third bridge across the Columbia river between southwest Washington and Oregon; and

    e. Preliminary design options for a third bridge.

2. A final report must be submitted to the transportation committees of the legislature by June 30, 2024.
