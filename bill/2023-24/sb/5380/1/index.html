<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that efficient and effective siting and permitting of new clean energy projects throughout Washington is necessary to: Fight climate change and achieve the state's greenhouse gas emission limits; improve air quality; grow family-wage clean energy jobs and innovative clean energy businesses that provide economic benefits across the state; and make available secure domestic sources of the clean energy products needed to transition off fossil fuels. These projects include renewable energy such as wind and solar, transmission, green electrolytic and renewable hydrogen, alternative jet fuels, battery and pumped storage of clean energy, and manufacturing of clean energy products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to: Enable more efficient and effective siting and permitting of clean energy projects with policies and investments that protect the environment, overburdened communities, and tribal resources; bring benefits to the communities that host clean energy projects; and facilitate the rapid transition to clean energy that is required to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on Washington's people and places. There is no single solution for improved siting and permitting processes. Rather, a variety of efforts and investments will help bring together state, local, tribal, and federal governments, communities, workers, clean energy project developers, and others to succeed in this essential task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient and effective siting and permitting will benefit from early and meaningful community and tribal engagement, and from up-front planning including identification of least-conflict sites, and programmatic environmental review that identifies measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate project impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating the principles and strategies identified in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section, the legislature intends to invest in, facilitate, and require better coordinated, faster environmental review and permitting decisions by state and local governments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support efficient, effective siting and permitting of clean energy projects through a variety of interventions, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Establishing an interagency clean energy siting coordinating council to improve siting and permitting of clean energy projects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a designation for clean energy projects of statewide significance to provide benefits including a clean energy navigator and access to the initial assessment and fully coordinated permitting processes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving processes for review of clean energy projects under the state environmental policy act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring preparation of a nonproject environmental impact statement for green electrolytic and renewable hydrogen projects statewide, and another for solar energy projects located in the Columbia Basin of central and eastern Washington, with the goal of preparing these nonproject environmental impact statements by June 30, 2025; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring the Washington State University energy program to complete by June 30, 2025, a least-conflict siting process for pumped storage projects in Washington.</p>
</li>

<p>Within 30 days, or longer with agreement of the project proponent, of the date that the department of ecology designates a project accepted for the fully coordinated permitting process, the department of ecology shall convene a work plan meeting with the project proponent, the department of commerce-appointed clean energy navigator, and the participating permit agencies to develop a coordinated permitting process schedule. The work plan meeting agenda may include any of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Review of the permits that are anticipated for the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A review of the permit application forms and other application requirements of the agencies that are participating in the coordinated permitting process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An estimation of the timelines that will be used by each participating permit agency to make permit decisions, including the estimated time periods required to determine if the permit applications are complete and to review or respond to each application or submittal of new information. In the development of this timeline, full attention must be given to achieving the maximum efficiencies possible through concurrent studies and consolidated applications, hearings, and comment periods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each participating agency and the lead agency under chapter 43.21C RCW must send at least one representative qualified to discuss the applicability and timelines associated with all permits administered by that agency or jurisdiction to the work plan meeting. At the request of the project proponent, the department of ecology must notify any relevant federal agency or federally recognized Indian tribe of the date of the meeting and invite them to participate in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any accelerated time period for the consideration of a permit application or for the completion of the environmental review process under chapter 43.21C RCW must be consistent with any statute, rule, or regulation, or adopted state policy, standard, or guideline that requires the participation of other agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes, or interested persons in the application process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the completion of the work plan meeting under subsection (4) of this section, the department of ecology must finalize the coordinated permitting process schedule, share it in writing with the project proponent, participating state agencies, lead agencies under chapter 43.21C RCW, and cities and counties subject to an agreement specified in section 209 of this act, and make the schedule available to the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a lead agency under chapter 43.21C RCW, a permit agency, or the project proponent foresees, at any time, that it will be unable to meet the estimated timelines or other obligations under the schedule agreement, it must notify the department of ecology of the reasons for the delay and offer potential solutions or an amended timeline. The department of ecology must notify the participating agencies and the project proponent and, upon agreement of all parties, adjust the schedule or, if necessary, schedule another work plan meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project proponent may withdraw from the coordinated permitting process by submitting to the department of ecology a written request that the process be terminated. Upon receipt of the request, the department must notify each participating agency that a coordinated permitting process is no longer applicable to the project.</p>

<p>The department of ecology must offer early, meaningful, and individual consultation with any affected federally recognized Indian tribe on designated clean energy projects of statewide significance for the purpose of understanding potential impacts to tribal rights and resources, including tribal cultural resources, archaeological sites, sacred sites, fisheries, or other rights and interests in tribal lands and lands within which an Indian tribe or tribes possess rights reserved or protected by federal treaty, statute, or executive order. The consultation is independent of, and in addition to, any public participation process required by state law, or by a state agency. The goal of the consultation process is to support the coordinated permitting process by identifying tribal resources or rights potentially affected by the project and determining if there are solutions to avoid, minimize, or mitigate any adverse effects on tribal resources or rights based on environmental or permit reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of ecology must identify overburdened communities, as defined in RCW 70A.02.010, which may be potentially affected by clean energy projects of statewide significance participating in the coordinated permitting process. The department of ecology must verify these communities have been meaningfully engaged in the regulatory processes in a timely manner by participating agencies and their comments considered for determining potential impacts.</p>
