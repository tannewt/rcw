All contributions made by a person or political committee whose contribution or expenditure activity is financed, maintained, or controlled by a trade association, labor union, collective bargaining organization, or the local unit of a trade association, labor union, or collective bargaining organization are considered made by the trade association, labor union, collective bargaining organization, or local unit of a trade association, labor union, or collective bargaining organization.</p>

<p>If two or more entities make contributions that are directed or controlled by a majority of the same persons, the contributions of those entities shall be aggregated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributions made by entities that are majority-owned by a person shall be aggregated with the contributions of the majority owner and all other entities majority-owned by that person, unless those entities act independently in their contribution-making decisions.</p>

<p>Been in existence for at least one year prior to making contributions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
