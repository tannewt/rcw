The review must be completed no later than January 1, 2025.</p>
</li>

<p>In undertaking the review authorized in subsection (2) of this section, the emergency management division shall consult with other state agencies as deemed appropriate by the emergency management division, electric utilities serving customers in Washington, and the owners or operators of power plants located in Washington.</p>
