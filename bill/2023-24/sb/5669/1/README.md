## Section 1
The legislature finds that both the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, section 24 of the Washington state Constitution, protect the right of individuals to bear arms in defense of themselves and shall not be impaired. As such, any law adopted by the state that creates firearms industry members' liability, or that bans a particular type of firearm is deemed unconstitutional.
