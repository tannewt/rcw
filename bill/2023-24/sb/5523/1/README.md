# SB 5523 - Forensic pathologists

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5523.pdf)

## Section 1
Forensic pathologists are medically trained doctors who perform autopsies. For the last decade, there has been a persistent shortage in forensic pathologists both locally and nationally and this problem has only grown worse. It is the intent of the legislature to incentivize people to enter the profession by alleviating the student loan burden for medically trained forensic pathologists.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Council" means the Washington state forensic investigations council created in chapter 43.103 RCW.

2. "Department" means the Washington state department of health.

3. "Identified shortage areas" means those areas where qualified forensic pathologists are in short supply because of geographic maldistribution or where vacancies exist that may compromise death investigations. The council, with assistance from the department, shall determine shortage areas.

4. "Loan repayment" means a loan that is paid in full or in part if the participant renders services as a qualified forensic pathologist as defined by the department.

5. "Office" means the office of student financial assistance.

6. "Participant" means a board-certified forensic pathologist who has commenced working in or is committed to working in identified shortage areas in the state of Washington for their required service obligation.

7. "Required service obligation" means an obligation by the participant to provide services as a board-certified forensic pathologist in identified shortage areas as determined by the council. Participants must provide an additional 12 months of service after receipt of their last loan repayment.

8. "Satisfied" means paid-in-full.

## Section 3
1. The forensic pathology loan repayment program is established for board-certified forensic pathologists providing services for counties in identified shortage areas.

## Section 4
1. The department, in consultation with the council and other pertinent stakeholders, may provide technical assistance to counties desiring to become sponsoring communities for the purposes of identification of prospective students for the forensic pathology loan repayment program, assisting prospective students to apply to an eligible education and training program, making formal agreements with prospective students to provide services as a board-certified forensic pathologist, forming agreements between rural and underserved counties in a service area to share credentialed forensic pathology professionals, and fulfilling any matching requirements.

2. From the amounts appropriated to the department, the department shall enter into a contract for a two-year marketing plan with the Washington association of coroners and medical examiners for the sole purpose of marketing Washington state to potential board-certified forensic pathologists. The marketing plan must include, but is not limited to, a focus on rural and underserved counties. Paying for administrative expenses may not exceed two percent of the appropriated funds.

## Section 5
The office shall establish a planning committee to assist in developing criteria for the selection of participants for the forensic pathology loan repayment program. The office shall include on the planning committee representatives of the department, the council, and other appropriate public and private agencies and organizations.

## Section 6
1. The department and the council, with the office, shall establish the annual loan repayment amount for each eligible board-certified forensic pathologist from the funds appropriated, based upon an assessment of reasonable eligible expenses involved in training and education up to $25,000 annually. The awards shall not be paid for more than a total of four years per participant. The annual award amount shall be established by the office.

2. Funds appropriated for the forensic pathologist loan repayment program, including reasonable administrative costs, may be used by the office for the purposes of loan repayments. The office shall annually establish the total amount of funding to be awarded for loan repayments and such allocations shall be established based upon the best utilization of funding for that year.

## Section 7
Participants in the forensic pathologist loan repayment program who are awarded loan repayments shall receive payment for the purpose of repaying educational loans secured while attending a program of training which led to a credential as a qualified forensic pathologist in the state of Washington.

2. Repayment shall be limited to eligible educational and living expenses as determined by the office and shall include principal and interest.

Payments shall be made quarterly, or more frequently if deemed appropriate by the office, to the participant until the loan is repaid or the participant becomes ineligible due to discontinued service in an identified shortage area, or after the required service obligation when eligibility discontinues, whichever comes first.

5. Should the participant discontinue service in an identified shortage area, payments against the loans of the participants shall cease to be effective on the date that the participant discontinues service.

6. Except for circumstances beyond their control, participants who serve less than the required service obligation shall be obligated to repay to the program an amount equal to the unsatisfied portion of the service obligation, or the total amount paid by the program on their behalf, whichever is less.

Participants who are unable to pay the full amount due shall enter into a payment arrangement with the office, including an arrangement for payment of interest. The maximum period for repayment is 10 years. The office shall determine the applicability of this subsection. The interest rate shall be determined by the office and be established by rule.

7. The office is responsible for the collection of payments made on behalf of participants from the participants who discontinue service before completion of the required service obligation. The office shall exercise due diligence in such collection, maintaining all necessary records to ensure that the maximum amount of payment made on behalf of the participant is recovered. Collection under this section shall be pursued using the full extent of the law, including wage garnishment if necessary.

8. The office shall not be held responsible for any outstanding payments on principal and interest to any lenders once a participant's eligibility expires.

9. The office shall temporarily or, in special circumstances, permanently defer the requirements of this section for eligible students as defined in RCW 28B.10.017.

The study shall cover issues related to Conrad 30 J-1 visa waivers and measures to encourage enrollment in the University of Washington and Washington State University forensic pathology residency programs. This study must also include recommendations on how to create two new forensic pathology fellow slots, one in conjunction with the University of Washington and one in conjunction with Washington State University. The Washington association of coroners and medical examiners shall directly report its findings and recommendations to the governor and the appropriate committees of the legislature by October 1, 2024.
