## Section 1
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 2(23), chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (section 2(23) of this act). The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

    a. The legislature categorizes the tax preference contained in section 2(23), chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (section 2(23) of this act) as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers and provide tax parity, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a) and (f).

    b. For the tax preference evaluation under subsection (2) of this section, the legislature's specific public policy objective is to provide tax parity resulting in leasehold excise tax relief for large arena facilities used for professional sports with the expectation that the operational entities overseeing operations at these facilities will provide substantial economic benefits to their specific region with a focus on: Providing employment opportunities for women and minority-owned businesses; fostering equity and social justice with an emphasis on arena-impacted communities; providing general community resource support; and ensuring quality access to the facilities for people across a range of income levels.

    c. For the tax preference evaluation under subsection (3) of this section, the legislature's specific public policy objectives are to provide tax parity resulting in leasehold excise tax relief with the expectation that employees employed at the facilities receive competitive wages and benefits and the facilities advance and promote diverse and inclusive voices, experiences, perspectives, and employment opportunities.

2. To measure the effectiveness of the tax preference identified in section 2(23), chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (section 2(23) of this act), except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate the following:

    a. State and local fiscal impacts;

    b. The number of employment positions and wages at the facility for all employers, and to the extent data is available, the degree to which employment positions at the facility have been filled by people residing in economically distressed regions of the county in which the facility is located. The evaluation must include a comparison of annual average wages at the facility and annual county average wages as published by the employment security department as part of its covered employment data;

    c. The extent to which the operational entity provides opportunities for patrons of all income levels to enjoy programming by offering seating at a range of price points that are equitably distributed throughout the facility; and

    d. The extent to which the operational entity generally contributes resources to: Organizations that serve the region; the communities surrounding the facility; and programs and services for youth, arts, music, and culture.

3. To measure the effectiveness of the tax preference in section 2(23), chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (section 2(23) of this act) for arenas with a seating capacity of 17,000 or less, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate the following:

    a. State and local fiscal impacts;

    b. The number of employment positions and wages at the facility for all employers operating at the facility. The evaluation must include a comparison of annual average wages at the facility and annual county average wages as published by the employment security department as part of its covered employment data;

    c. The financial stability of the facility through an examination of revenues and expenditures specific to the facility;

    d. The types of programming and events scheduled at the facility; and

    e. The economic impact of the facility in the county in which the facility is located.

4. The joint legislative audit and review committee shall review the effectiveness of the tax preferences in RCW 82.29A.130 (14), (15), and (21) using the criteria specified in subsections (1)(b) and (2) of this section.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the reviews in subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section, the department of revenue must provide tax-related data needed for the joint legislative audit and review committee analysis, including the annual tax performance reports provided pursuant to RCW 82.32.534. In addition to the data source described under this subsection, the joint legislative audit and review committee may use any other data it deems necessary and the legislative auditor, or his or her designee, may contact operational entities after the effective date of this section to establish appropriate documentation to be provided by the operational entities to the joint legislative audit and review committee to facilitate its review of the tax preferences identified in this act.

6. For the purpose of this section, "operational entity" means a limited liability company or any other public or private legal entity that is primarily responsible for the management and operation of a stadium or arena facility.
