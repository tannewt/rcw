# SB 5312 - Clean energy/residential

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5312.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the efficiency and resiliency of residential buildings in Washington is essential for ensuring the health and safety of residents and tenants; for using water and energy more efficiently; and for economic development of our communities. Residential buildings in Washington have significant needs for resiliency retrofits, including seismic improvements, stormwater management, flood mitigation, wildfire and wind resistance, and clean energy and energy efficiency improvements, but these improvements often have high up-front capital costs.

2. This chapter authorizes the establishment of a residential property assessed clean energy and resiliency (R-PACER) program that jurisdictions can voluntarily implement to ensure that free and willing owners of single-family and multifamily residential properties with four or fewer dwelling units can obtain low-cost, long-term financing for qualifying improvements, including energy efficiency, water conservation, clean energy, renewable energy, and resiliency projects. These improvements are repaid by a voluntary assessment on the property, secured by a county lien, and assigned to a capital provider for all the administrative aspects of billing, collecting, and enforcing the lien and without the accumulation of cost to the county and without the creation of a personal debt obligation to the property owner. The obligation is instead carried by the property and remains with the property until repaid, regardless of any potential transfer of property ownership. After the adoption of an R-PACER program, a county's role is limited to the approval of an assessment and recordation of an R-PACER lien, and administration of the R-PACER program which may be contracted out to a private third party.

3. The legislature declares that the establishment and operation of an R-PACER program by this act serves important public health and safety interests. A qualified improvement as defined in RCW 36.165.010 provides benefit to the public, either in the form of energy or water resource conservation, reduced public health risk, or reduced public emergency response risk. Accordingly, the governing body of a county is authorized to determine that it is convenient and advantageous to adopt a program under this chapter.

## Section 7
1. The R-PACER lien amount plus any interest, penalties, and charges accrued or accruing on the R-PACER lien:

    a. Takes precedence over all other liens or encumbrances except a lien for taxes imposed by the state, a local government, or a junior taxing district on real property, which liens for taxes shall have priority over such benefit R-PACER lien, provided existing mortgage holders, if any, have provided written consent described in section 8 of this act; and

    b. Is a first and prior lien, second only to a lien for taxes imposed by the state, a local government, or a junior taxing district against the real property on which a R-PACER lien is imposed, from the date on which the notice of the R-PACER lien is recorded until the R-PACER lien, interest, penalties, and charges accrued or accruing are paid.

2. The R-PACER lien runs with the land, and that portion of the R-PACER lien that has not yet become due is not accelerated or eliminated by foreclosure of the R-PACER lien or any lien for taxes imposed by the state, a local government, or junior taxing district against the real property on which the R-PACER lien is imposed.

3. Delinquent installments due on an R-PACER lien incur interest and penalties as specified in the financing agreement.

4. After the R-PACER lien is recorded as provided in this section, the voluntary assessment and the R-PACER lien may not be contested on the basis that the improvement is not a qualified improvement or that the project is not a qualified project.

5. Collection and enforcement of delinquent R-PACER liens or R-PACER assessment installments, including through foreclosure as set forth in subsection (6) of this section, are the responsibility of the capital provider.

6. [Empty]

    a. The R-PACER lien shall be enforced by the capital provider at any time after one year from the date of delinquency in the same manner that the collection of delinquent real property taxes is enforced by the county and county treasurer under chapter 84.64 RCW, including the provisions of RCW 84.64.040, excepting that:

        i. A sworn declaration by the capital provider or assignee attesting to the assessment delinquency of at least one year shall be used in lieu of the certificate required under RCW 84.64.050; and

        ii. Any action or obligation under RCW 84.64.080, including the issuance of a tax deed, that cannot be undertaken by the capital provider or assignee shall be performed by the county or county treasurer. These duties facilitate the enforcement of the R-PACER lien by the capital provider or assignee, as applicable, and shall not constitute prohibited enforcement activities under section 13 of this act.

Before a capital provider may enter into a financing agreement to provide R-PACER financing of a qualified project to a record owner of any eligible property, the capital provider must receive written consent from any holder of a lien, mortgage, or security interest in the real property that the property may participate in the program and that the R-PACER lien will take precedence over all other liens except for a lien for taxes as described in section 7 of this act.

2. Before a capital provider may enter into a financing agreement to provide R-PACER financing of a qualified project to the record owner of any multifamily residential real property with five or more dwelling units, the program administrator must also receive written consent from any and all holders of affordable housing covenants, restrictions, or regulatory agreements in the real property that the property may participate in the program and that the R-PACER lien will take precedence over all other liens except for a lien for taxes as described in section 7 of this act.

## Section 12
The members of the governing body of a county, employees of a county, and board members, executives, and employees under this chapter are not personally liable as a result of exercising any rights or responsibilities granted under this chapter.

## Section 13
A county may not enforce any privately financed debt under this chapter. Neither the state nor any county may use public funds to fund or repay any loan between a capital provider and property owner. No section under this chapter shall be interpreted to pledge, offer, or encumber the full faith and credit of a local government, nor shall any local government pledge, offer, or encumber its full faith and credit for any lien amount through a program.
