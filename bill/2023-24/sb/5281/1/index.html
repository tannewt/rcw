<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that airports can have significant impacts on the communities in which they are located, including, the quality of life of its residents and employees, infrastructure demands, and environmental and public health burdens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the airports can exacerbate historic environmental health disparities and poor air quality in those communities and for the employees that work in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the levying 5 cents of the existing 18 cent aircraft fuel excise tax on commercial aircraft operators can provide a funding source to further address these environmental and other impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the federal aviation administration has determined that this 5 cent portion of the aircraft fuel tax qualifies for grandfathered status and therefore does not need to meet the airport revenue use requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to impose only a portion of the aircraft fuel excise tax on commercial aircraft, while creating a funding mechanism to mitigate the impacts of emissions and pollutants, and to further environmental justice goals in airport locations throughout the state.</p>
