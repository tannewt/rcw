<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act may be known and cited as the education equity in every zip code act or EEEZ act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that too many children in our state remain trapped in a system where the quality of, and access to, their education is determined by their zip code. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the nearly year long school closures that resulted, have only exacerbated this unfairness. While the legislature, in addressing the McCleary decision, made inroads by increasing state funding for basic education and decreasing reliance on local levies, this progress was significantly undermined in 2019 when the legislature raised local levy authority by 67 percent, thus returning to greater reliance on local levies to fund education and the inherent inequities in such a funding system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that it is appropriate and necessary to reduce the reliance on local levies in our school system and accordingly to significantly increase the state's basic education funding in ways that will address these funding and educational inequities. Eliminating a system where a child's quality of, and access to, education is tied to their zip code is the equity issue of our time and critical to our state's future and the future of our children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act makes permanent enhancements to the basic education funding formula that will increase equity including: Increasing special education funding; lowering class sizes for vocational education classes and skills centers; and enhancing access to and funding for gifted education programs. Schools serving a high percentage of low-income students are aided with greater funding for the learning assistance program, and property-poor districts receive increased state funding for local effort assistance to alleviate inequities with their wealthier counterparts. These funding increases will lead to more level access across the state to critical and fundamental services for students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further takes notice that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the nearly year long absence from in-person learning that occurred, has taken a significant toll on the academic progress of our children. The most recent state assessment found that only one in three students are at grade level in both reading and math. The figures are significantly worse for lower-income, special education, and Native American, black, and Hispanic students. Under this act, schools are incentivized to choose innovative methods, including a balanced school calendar or increased instructional hours, to improve student performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends with the education equity in every zip code act to remedy the infirmities in the present system and assist students, regardless of their zip code, to achieve their highest potential.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that, for highly capable students, access to accelerated learning and enhanced instruction is access to a basic education. There are multiple definitions of highly capable, from intellectual to academic to artistic. The research literature strongly supports using multiple criteria to identify highly capable students, and therefore, the legislature does not intend to prescribe a single method. Instead, the legislature intends to allocate funding based on 7.0 percent of each school district's population and authorize school districts to identify through the use of multiple, objective criteria those students most highly capable and eligible to receive accelerated learning and enhanced instruction in the program offered by the school district. District practices for identifying the most highly capable students must prioritize equitable identification of low-income students. Access to accelerated learning and enhanced instruction through the program for highly capable students does not constitute an individual entitlement for any particular student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplementary funds provided by the state for the program for highly capable students under RCW 28A.150.260 shall be categorical funding to provide services to highly capable students as determined by a school district under RCW 28A.185.030.</p>

Nothing in this section requires school districts to maintain a particular classroom teacher-to-student ratio or other staff-to-student ratio or to use allocated funds to pay for particular types or classifications of staff. Nothing in this section entitles an individual teacher to a particular teacher planning period.</p>

<li>
<p>To promote transparency in state funding allocations, the superintendent of public instruction must report state per-pupil allocations for each school district for the general apportionment, special education, learning assistance, transitional bilingual, highly capable, and career and technical education programs. The superintendent must report this information in a user-friendly format on the main page of the office's website. School districts must include a link to the superintendent's per-pupil allocations report on the main page of the school district's website. In addition, the budget documents published by the legislature for the enacted omnibus operating appropriations act must report statewide average per-pupil allocations for general apportionment and the categorical programs listed in this subsection.</p>

<p>To the extent the technical details of the formula have been adopted by the legislature and except when specifically provided as a school district allocation, the distribution formula for the basic education instructional allocation shall be based on minimum staffing and nonstaff costs the legislature deems necessary to support instruction and operations in prototypical schools serving high, middle, and elementary school students as provided in this section. The use of prototypical schools for the distribution formula does not constitute legislative intent that schools should be operated or structured in a similar fashion as the prototypes. Prototypical schools illustrate the level of resources needed to operate a school of a particular size with particular types and grade levels of students using commonly understood terms and inputs, such as class size, hours of instruction, and various categories of school staff. It is the intent that the funding allocations to school districts be adjusted from the school prototypes based on the actual number of annual average full-time equivalent students in each grade level at each school in the district and not based on the grade-level configuration of the school to the extent that data is available. The allocations shall be further adjusted from the school prototypes with minimum allocations for small schools and to reflect other factors identified in the omnibus appropriations act.</p>

Nothing in this section requires school districts to maintain a particular classroom teacher-to-student ratio or other staff-to-student ratio or to use allocated funds to pay for particular types or classifications of staff. Nothing in this section entitles an individual teacher to a particular teacher planning period.</p>

<li>
<p>To promote transparency in state funding allocations, the superintendent of public instruction must report state per-pupil allocations for each school district for the general apportionment, special education, learning assistance, transitional bilingual, highly capable, and career and technical education programs. The superintendent must report this information in a user-friendly format on the main page of the office's website. School districts must include a link to the superintendent's per-pupil allocations report on the main page of the school district's website. In addition, the budget documents published by the legislature for the enacted omnibus operating appropriations act must report statewide average per-pupil allocations for general apportionment and the categorical programs listed in this subsection.</p>

<p>To the extent the technical details of the formula have been adopted by the legislature and except when specifically provided as a school district allocation, the distribution formula for the basic education instructional allocation shall be based on minimum staffing and nonstaff costs the legislature deems necessary to support instruction and operations in prototypical schools serving high, middle, and elementary school students as provided in this section. The use of prototypical schools for the distribution formula does not constitute legislative intent that schools should be operated or structured in a similar fashion as the prototypes. Prototypical schools illustrate the level of resources needed to operate a school of a particular size with particular types and grade levels of students using commonly understood terms and inputs, such as class size, hours of instruction, and various categories of school staff. It is the intent that the funding allocations to school districts be adjusted from the school prototypes based on the actual number of annual average full-time equivalent students in each grade level at each school in the district and not based on the grade-level configuration of the school to the extent that data is available. The allocations shall be further adjusted from the school prototypes with minimum allocations for small schools and to reflect other factors identified in the omnibus appropriations act.</p>
