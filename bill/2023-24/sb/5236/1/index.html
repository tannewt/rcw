<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the COVID-19 public health emergency pushed our health care system to its breaking point. Our nurses and health care workers who directly care for and support patients have continued to provide high quality care despite the incredible challenges; however, it has not been without significant sacrifice. Nurses and health care workers are facing unprecedented levels of stress and job turnover. These concerns existed before the pandemic and have only worsened during this public health emergency. The legislature finds that improving nurse and health care worker safety and working conditions leads to better patient care. Specifically, establishing minimum nurse-to-patient staffing standards, expanding break and overtime laws for certain health care workers, and requiring hospital staffing committees to create staffing plans, all of which are subject to enforcement and penalties for violations, will better serve patients and our community.</p>
