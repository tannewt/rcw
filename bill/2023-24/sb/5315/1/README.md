## Section 2
1. For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of RCW 28A.155.020 through 28A.155.050, the board of directors of every school district shall be authorized to contract with nonpublic agencies approved by the superintendent of public instruction for operating special education programs for students with disabilities. Approval standards for such nonpublic agencies shall conform substantially with those of special education programs in the common schools. For purposes of this section, a "nonpublic agency" means a private or out-of-state agency that contracts with a school district to provide a program of special education for students with disabilities.

2. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must create a master contract to govern the placement of students receiving special education services with nonpublic agencies. The contract must include, at a minimum:

    a. A description of the administrative and financial agreements between the school district and the nonpublic agency to provide special education services, including provisions for recordkeeping and documentation of services provided to ensure that students have the opportunity to make appropriate educational progress and receive appropriate credit towards earning a diploma;

    b. A list of each qualified staff member providing special education services and a copy of the license or credential that qualifies each staff member to provide those services;

    c. A description of the financial safeguards in place to track revenues and expenditures associated with contracted placements to ensure that funds are used to provide special education services to students;

    d. A description of the nonpublic agency's responsibilities and processes for data collection and reporting for students;

    e. Acknowledgment that the nonpublic agency must comply with all emergency response protocols and isolation and restraint procedures as provided in each student's individualized education program and RCW 28A.600.485;

    f. Acknowledgment that the nonpublic agency must notify the school district and the office of the superintendent of public instruction of any program, staffing, or facility changes that may affect the agency's ability to provide contracted services; and

    g. Acknowledgment that the nonpublic agency must comply with all relevant state and federal laws that are applicable to the school district.

3. The office of the superintendent of public instruction and the contracting school district must conduct a joint on-site visit of the nonpublic agency before approving a contract under this section, and either the office of the superintendent of public instruction or the contracting school district must conduct at least one on-site visit annually thereafter while the contract is in effect. When conducting an on-site visit, the office of the superintendent of public instruction and the contracting school district must ensure that all facilities, staffing levels, and procedural safeguards are sufficient to provide a safe and appropriate learning environment for all students served under the contract, and verify that the nonpublic agency is in compliance with all contract requirements.

4. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may approve a contract under this section for a period of up to three years. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew its approval of a nonpublic agency contract if the nonpublic agency:

    a. Fails to comply with all contract requirements or fails to maintain approval standards;

    b. Violates the rights of students eligible for special education services; or

    c. Refuses to implement any corrective actions ordered by the office of the superintendent of public instruction.

5. The office of the superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with school districts and other state agencies, must engage in rule making to create the nonpublic agency master contract and approval standards required under this section.

## Section 3
A student's individualized education program  must include  procedures for notification of a parent or guardian regarding the use of restraint or isolation. If a student is served by a nonpublic agency, the student's individualized education program must also specify any additional procedures required to ensure the nonpublic agency fully complies with RCW 28A.600.485.

## Section 4
1. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Isolation" means restricting the student alone within a room or any other form of enclosure, from which the student may not leave. It does not include a student's voluntary use of a quiet space for self-calming, or temporary removal of a student from his or her regular instructional area to an unlocked area for purposes of carrying out an appropriate positive behavior intervention plan.

    b. "Restraint" means physical intervention or force used to control a student, including the use of a restraint device to restrict a student's freedom of movement. It does not include appropriate use of a prescribed medical, orthopedic, or therapeutic device when used as intended, such as to achieve proper body position, balance, or alignment, or to permit a student to safely participate in activities.

    c. "Restraint device" means a device used to assist in controlling a student, including but not limited to metal handcuffs, plastic ties, ankle restraints, leather cuffs, other hospital-type restraints, pepper spray, tasers, or batons. Restraint device does not mean a seat harness used to safely transport students. This section shall not be construed as encouraging the use of these devices.

    d. "School" means a public school as defined in RCW 28A.150.010 or a nonpublic agency that contracts with a school district as authorized under RCW 28A.155.060.

2. The provisions of this section apply to all students, including those who have an individualized education program or plan developed under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973. The provisions of this section apply only to incidents of restraint or isolation that occur while a student is participating in school-sponsored instruction or activities.

3. [Empty]

    a. An individualized education program or plan developed under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 must not include the use of restraint or isolation as a planned behavior intervention unless a student's individual needs require more specific advanced educational planning and the student's parent or guardian agrees. All other plans may refer to the district policy developed under subsection (3)(b) of this section. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the provision of a free appropriate public education under Part B of the federal individuals with disabilities education improvement act or section 504 of the federal rehabilitation act of 1973.

    b. Restraint or isolation of any student is permitted only when reasonably necessary to control spontaneous behavior that poses an imminent likelihood of serious harm. Restraint or isolation must be closely monitored to prevent harm to the student, and must be discontinued as soon as the likelihood of serious harm has dissipated. Each school district shall adopt a policy providing for the least amount of restraint or isolation appropriate to protect the safety of students and staff under such circumstances.

4. Following the release of a student from the use of restraint or isolation, the school must implement follow-up procedures. These procedures must include: (a) Reviewing the incident with the student and the parent or guardian to address the behavior that precipitated the restraint or isolation and the appropriateness of the response; and (b) reviewing the incident with the staff member who administered the restraint or isolation to discuss whether proper procedures were followed and what training or support the staff member needs to help the student avoid similar incidents.

5. Any school employee, resource officer, or school security officer who uses isolation or restraint on a student during school-sponsored instruction or activities must inform the building administrator or building administrator's designee as soon as possible, and within two business days submit a written report of the incident to the district office. The written report must include, at a minimum, the following information:

    a. The date and time of the incident;

    b. The name and job title of the individual who administered the restraint or isolation;

    c. A description of the activity that led to the restraint or isolation;

    d. The type of restraint or isolation used on the student, including the duration;

    e. Whether the student or staff was physically injured during the restraint or isolation incident and any medical care provided; and

    f. Any recommendations for changing the nature or amount of resources available to the student and staff members in order to avoid similar incidents.

6. The principal or principal's designee must make a reasonable effort to verbally inform the student's parent or guardian within 24 hours of the incident, and must send written notification as soon as practical but postmarked no later than five business days after the restraint or isolation occurred. If the school or school district customarily provides the parent or guardian with school-related information in a language other than English, the written report under this section must be provided to the parent or guardian in that language.

    b. No later than 90 days after receipt, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall publish to its website the data received by the districts. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may use this data to investigate the training, practices, and other efforts used by schools and districts to reduce the use of restraint and isolation. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may also use this data to determine if a nonpublic agency is in compliance with all contract obligations and approval standards, as authorized in RCW 28A.155.060.

## Section 5
