## Section 1

    a. The Washington state cannabis commission is established to benefit the people of the state of Washington and its economy;

    b. The general welfare of the people of the state will be served by the research and development of best practices surrounding safe cultivation and processing activities of cannabis so the industry is therefore affected with the public interest; and

    c. Creating a Washington state cannabis commission for the public purpose of administering the revenue of the commission serves the public interest by materially advancing the producing and processing of cannabis and improving sustainability in the cannabis producing and processing sectors.

3. To complement the development of a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the production and processing of cannabis and cannabis products, the legislature further declares that:

    b. Cannabis production and processing is a highly regulated industry and that this chapter and the rules adopted under it are only one aspect of the regulated industry. Other applicable laws include:

        i. Chapter 15.130 RCW, the food safety and security act;

        ii. Chapter 15.125 RCW, cannabis and cannabis products;

        iii. Title 69 RCW, food, drugs, cosmetics, and poisons; and

        iv. Chapter 82.08 RCW, retail sales tax.
