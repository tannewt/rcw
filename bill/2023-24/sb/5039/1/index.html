<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is in the best interest of the state, our citizens, and our natural resources to identify the sources of wildland fires; identify and implement best practices to reduce the prevalence and intensity of those wildland fires; put those practices in place; and by putting those practices in place, reduce the risk of wildland fires and damage and losses resulting from those fires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that electric utilities are partners with relevant state agencies, emergency responders, and public and private entities in identifying best practices to reduce the risk of and prevent wildland fires. Many electric utilities have developed and are implementing wildfire mitigation plans. The legislature further finds that electric utilities should adopt and implement wildfire mitigation plans, and that electric utilities should be informed by recognized best practices, as applicable to their geography, terrain, vegetation, and other characteristics specific in their service area, for reducing wildland fire risk and reducing damage from wildland fires as may be ignited by electric utility equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize the identification of best practices guidelines and to require that electric utilities provide their wildfire mitigation plans to the state in order to promote public transparency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The office shall contract with an independent consultant with experience in developing electric utility wildfire mitigation plans to recommend a plan format and identify and recommend a list of actions to be included in electric utility wildfire mitigation plans, including best practices guidance that may apply to each action as appropriate. In identifying the plan format and list of actions, the office shall seek input from the utilities and transportation commission, the department of natural resources, the utility wildland fire prevention advisory committee, electric utilities, the state fire marshal, the governor's office of Indian affairs, and the public. By April 1, 2024, the office shall make public a recommended format and list of actions for electric utility wildfire mitigation plans. The office may update these guidelines annually if needed, but not more than once in each year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recommended actions must acknowledge that utilities serve areas that vary in topography, vegetation, population, and other characteristics, and that best practices guidelines within each action must recognize that a utility's wildfire mitigation measures will be designed to fit site-specific circumstances. The recommended actions must include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Vegetation management along transmission and distribution lines and near associated equipment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infrastructure inspection and maintenance repair activities, schedules, and recordkeeping;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifications or upgrades to facilities and construction of new facilities to incorporate cost-effective measures to minimize fire risk;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preventative programs, including adoption of new technologies to harden utility infrastructure;</p>
</li>

<p>Operational procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identification of appropriate widths for vegetation management and rights-of-way, including the consideration of fire-resistant vegetation alternatives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protocols for disabling reclosers and deenergizing portions of the electric system along with associated communication plans for impacted parties and the public, including highly impacted communities as defined in RCW 19.405.020, vulnerable populations as defined in RCW 19.405.020, and persons reliant on electricity to maintain necessary life functions;</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Each electric utility's protocols must include a description of how the utility will mitigate the public safety impacts of disabling reclosers and deenergizing portions of the electric system that consider the impacts on all of the following: Critical first responders, local and tribal governments, health and communication infrastructure, highly impacted communities as defined in RCW 19.405.020, vulnerable populations as defined in RCW 19.405.020, and persons reliant on electricity to maintain necessary life functions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decisions about whether or not to disable reclosers and deenergize electric lines are reserved to the electric utility; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public and interested parties' engagement and communication plans addressing wildfire safety and risk mitigation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recommended format and list of actions identified by the office must be forwarded to the utilities and transportation commission, the department of natural resources, and all electric utilities in Washington state for a review period of no less than three months prior to finalizing the format and list of actions that utilities will use to adopt or update their electric utility wildfire mitigation plan.</p>
