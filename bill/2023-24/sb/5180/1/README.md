A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
