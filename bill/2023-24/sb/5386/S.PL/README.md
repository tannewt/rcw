## Section 4
(1) The home security fund account is created in the state treasury, subject to appropriation. The state's portion of the surcharge established in RCW 36.22.179 and 36.22.1791 and 36.22.176 must be deposited in the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for homeless housing programs as described in this chapter, including the eviction prevention rental assistance program established in RCW 43.185C.185.

## Section 5
1. During each calendar year in which moneys from the home security fund account are available for use by the department for the homeless housing grant program, the department shall announce to all Washington counties, participating cities, and through major media throughout the state, a grant application period of at least ninety days' duration. This announcement will be made as often as the director deems appropriate for proper utilization of resources. The department shall then promptly grant as many applications as will utilize available funds, less appropriate administrative costs of the department as described in section 1(4)(a) of this act.

2. The department will develop, with advice and input from the affordable housing advisory board established in RCW 43.185B.020, criteria to evaluate grant applications.

    j. Other elements shown by the applicant to be directly related to the goal and the department's state strategic plan.

## Section 6
1. Only a local government is eligible to receive a homeless housing grant from the home security fund account. Any city may assert responsibility for homeless housing within its borders if it so chooses, by forwarding a resolution to the legislative authority of the county stating its intention and its commitment to operate a separate homeless housing program. The city shall then receive a percentage of the surcharge assessed under section 1(2)(b) of this act equal to the percentage of the city's local portion of the real estate excise tax collected by the county. A participating city may also then apply separately for homeless housing program grants. A city choosing to operate a separate homeless housing program shall be responsible for complying with all of the same requirements as counties and shall adopt a local homeless housing plan meeting the requirements of this chapter for county local plans. However, the city may by resolution of its legislative authority accept the county's homeless housing task force as its own and based on that task force's recommendations adopt a homeless housing plan specific to the city.

2. Local governments applying for homeless housing funds may subcontract with any other local government, housing authority, community action agency or other nonprofit organization for the execution of programs contributing to the overall goal of ending homelessness within a defined service area. All subcontracts shall be consistent with the local homeless housing plan adopted by the legislative authority of the local government, time limited, and filed with the department and shall have specific performance terms. While a local government has the authority to subcontract with other entities, the local government continues to maintain the ultimate responsibility for the homeless housing program within its borders.

3. A county may decline to participate in the program authorized in this chapter by forwarding to the department a resolution adopted by the county legislative authority stating the intention not to participate. A copy of the resolution shall also be transmitted to the county auditor and treasurer. If such a resolution is adopted, all of the funds otherwise due to the county under RCW 43.185C.060 shall be remitted monthly to the state treasurer for deposit in the home security fund account, without any reduction by the county for collecting or administering the funds. Upon receipt of the resolution, the department shall promptly begin to identify and contract with one or more entities eligible under this section to create and execute a local homeless housing plan for the county meeting the requirements of this chapter. The department shall expend all of the funds received from the county under this subsection to carry out the purposes of chapter 484, Laws of 2005 in the county, provided that the department may retain six percent of these funds to offset the cost of managing the county's program.

4. A resolution by the county declining to participate in the program shall have no effect on the ability of each city in the county to assert its right to manage its own program under this chapter, and the county shall monthly transmit to the city the funds due under this chapter.

## Section 7
1. The eviction prevention rental assistance program is created in the department to prevent evictions by providing resources to households most likely to become homeless or suffer severe health consequences, or both, after an eviction, while promoting equity by prioritizing households, including communities of color, disproportionately impacted by public health emergencies and by homelessness and housing instability. The department must provide grants to eligible organizations, as described in RCW 43.185.060, to provide assistance to program participants. The eligible organizations must use grant moneys for:

    a. Rental assistance, including rental arrears and future rent if needed to stabilize the applicant's housing and prevent their eviction;

    b. Utility assistance for households if needed to prevent an eviction; and

    c. Administrative costs of the eligible organization, which must not exceed limits prescribed by the department.

2. Households eligible to receive assistance through the eviction prevention rental assistance program are those:

    a. With incomes at or below 80 percent of the county area median income;

    b. Who are families with children, living in doubled up situations, young adults, senior citizens, and others at risk of homelessness or significant physical or behavioral health complications from homelessness; and

    c. That meet any other eligibility requirements as established by the department after consultation with stakeholder groups, including persons at risk of homelessness due to unpaid rent, representatives of communities of color, homeless service providers, landlord representatives, local governments that administer homelessness assistance, a statewide association representing cities, a statewide association representing counties, a representative of homeless youth and young adults, and affordable housing advocates.

3. A landlord may assist an eligible household in applying for assistance through the eviction prevention rental assistance program or may apply for assistance on an eligible household's behalf.

4. [Empty]

    a. Eligible grantees must actively work with organizations rooted in communities of color to assist and serve marginalized populations within their communities.

    b. At least 10 percent of the grant total must be subgranted to organizations that serve and are substantially governed by marginalized populations to pay the costs associated with program outreach, assistance completing applications for assistance, rent assistance payments, activities that directly support the goal of improving access to rent assistance for people of color, and related costs. Upon request by an eligible grantee or the county or city in which it exists, the department must provide a list of organizations that serve and are substantially governed by marginalized populations, if known.

    c. An eligible grantee may request an exemption from the department from the requirements under (b) of this subsection. The department must consult with the stakeholder group established under subsection (2)(c) of this section before granting an exemption. An eligible grantee may request an exemption only if the eligible grantee:

        i. Is unable to subgrant with an organization that serves and is substantially governed by marginalized populations; or

        ii. Provides the department with a plan to spend 10 percent of the grant total in a manner that the department determines will improve racial equity for historically underserved communities more effectively than a subgrant.

5. The department must ensure equity by developing performance measures and benchmarks that promote both equitable program access and equitable program outcomes. Performance measures and benchmarks must be developed by the department in consultation with stakeholder groups, including persons at risk of homelessness due to unpaid rent, representatives of communities of color, homeless service providers, landlord representatives, local governments that administer homelessness assistance, a statewide association representing cities, a statewide association representing counties, a representative of homeless youth and young adults, and affordable housing advocates. Performance measures and benchmarks must also ensure that the race and ethnicity of households served under the program are proportional to the numbers of people at risk of homelessness in each county for each of the following groups:

    a. Black or African American;

    b. American Indian and Alaska Native;

    c. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander;

    d. Hispanic or Latinx;

    e. Asian;

    f. Other multiracial.

6. The department may develop additional rules, requirements, procedures, and guidelines as necessary to implement and operate the eviction prevention rental assistance program.

7. [Empty]

    a. The department must award funds under this section to eligible grantees in a manner that is proportional to the amount of revenue collected under section 1 of this act from the county being served by the grantee.

    b. The department must provide counties with the right of first refusal to receive grant funds distributed under this subsection. If a county refuses the funds or does not respond within a time frame established by the department, the department must identify an alternative grantee. The alternative grantee must distribute the funds in a manner that is in compliance with this chapter.

    b. At least seventy-five percent of the occupied dwelling units in the rental housing or lots in a mobile home park are occupied by a qualifying household; and

    c. The rental housing or lots in a mobile home park were insured, financed, or assisted in whole or in part through one or more of the following sources:

        i. A federal or state housing program administered by the department of commerce;

        ii. A federal housing program administered by a city or county government;

2. If less than seventy-five percent of the occupied dwelling units within the rental housing or lots in the mobile home park are occupied by qualifying households, the rental housing or mobile home park is eligible for a partial exemption on the real property and a total exemption of the housing's or park's personal property as follows:

    a. A partial exemption is allowed for each dwelling unit in the rental housing or for each lot in a mobile home park occupied by a qualifying household.

    b. The amount of exemption must be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the property reasonably necessary to provide the rental housing or to operate the mobile home park by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the number of dwelling units or lots occupied by qualifying households as of December 31st of the first assessment year in which the rental housing or mobile home park becomes operational or on January 1st of each subsequent assessment year for which the exemption is claimed. The denominator of the fraction is the total number of dwelling units or lots occupied as of December 31st of the first assessment year the rental housing or mobile home park becomes operational and January 1st of each subsequent assessment year for which exemption is claimed.

3. If a currently exempt rental housing unit or mobile home lot in a mobile home park was occupied by a qualifying household at the time the exemption was granted and the income of the household subsequently rises above the threshold set in subsection (7)(e) of this section but remains at or below eighty percent of the median income, the exemption will continue as long as the housing continues to meet the certification requirements listed in subsection (1) of this section. For purposes of this section, median income, as most recently determined by the federal department of housing and urban development for the county in which the rental housing or mobile home park is located, shall be adjusted for family size. However, if a dwelling unit or a lot becomes vacant and is subsequently rerented, the income of the new household must be at or below the threshold set in subsection (7)(e) of this section to remain exempt from property tax.

4. If at the time of initial application the property is unoccupied, or subsequent to the initial application the property is unoccupied because of renovations, and the property is not currently being used for the exempt purpose authorized by this section but will be used for the exempt purpose within two assessment years, the property shall be eligible for a property tax exemption for the assessment year in which the claim for exemption is submitted under the following conditions:

    a. A commitment for financing to acquire, construct, renovate, or otherwise convert the property to provide housing for qualifying households has been obtained, in whole or in part, by the nonprofit entity claiming the exemption from one or more of the sources listed in subsection (1)(c) of this section;

    b. The nonprofit entity has manifested its intent in writing to construct, remodel, or otherwise convert the property to housing for qualifying households; and

    c. Only the portion of property that will be used to provide housing or lots for qualifying households shall be exempt under this section.

5. To be exempt under this section, the property must be used exclusively for the purposes for which the exemption is granted, except as provided in RCW 84.36.805.

6. The nonprofit entity qualifying for a property tax exemption under this section may agree to make payments to the city, county, or other political subdivision for improvements, services, and facilities furnished by the city, county, or political subdivision for the benefit of the rental housing. However, these payments shall not exceed the amount last levied as the annual tax of the city, county, or political subdivision upon the property prior to exemption.
