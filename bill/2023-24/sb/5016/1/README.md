# SB 5016 - Homelessness

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5016.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that homelessness has increased in Washington, and most of the current expenditures to address homelessness are not reducing homelessness but are in fact increasing homelessness. Homelessness is exacerbated by housing and environmental government policies that result in the lack of available and affordable housing and an increase in rents and increased costs and effectively reducing incomes making housing more difficult. In addition, homelessness is often caused by complex and long-term behavioral health conditions, substance addiction, or disabilities, or as a result of domestic violence. Every night, thousands of Washingtonians go to sleep in places not meant for human habitation, such as cars, parks, sidewalks, abandoned buildings, and spaces on public land. The legislature finds that current policies to address homelessness in Washington are inadequate and must be addressed. The provision of mental health and substance abuse treatment options must be part of the solution. Cities and counties are struggling to cope with unauthorized camping and its negative environmental and social impacts. The legislature intends that persons experiencing homelessness be treated with dignity, care, and compassion. The legislature recognizes that Washingtonians have compassion for the homeless, but also expect that the homeless be required to take advantage of mental health and substance abuse treatment options and that those physically able should provide either a portion of their limited income or community service to repay taxpayers.

## Section 2
Subject to the availability of funds appropriated for this specific purpose, the department must provide grants to local governments or nonprofit organizations to meet the individual needs of persons experiencing homelessness to facilitate their transition to permanent housing. The grants must include graduated rental assistance programs that require participants to contribute either a percentage of their income to rent or to do community service in exchange for rental assistance.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. Every county and each city with a population over 50,000 must establish and operate at least one emergency overnight shelter site in its respective jurisdiction. Counties and each eligible city within the county's geographic boundary must coordinate to ensure that there are enough cumulative shelter beds to accommodate, at a minimum, the sheltered and unsheltered portions of the county's most recent point-in-time homeless count.

    b. Counties and each eligible city must make available employment, mental health, and drug counseling services at each shelter location with funding made available from the state operating budget or local funds as appropriated for these purposes. Each shelter must provide for a safe environment for shelter residents during shelter operating hours. Each shelter may prohibit the possession and use of alcohol and unprescribed drugs on its premises contingent upon evaluation for and compliance with treatment as recommended.

2. Any county or city establishing a shelter under this section may utilize assistance under the housing trust fund pursuant to RCW 43.185.050 to acquire or build shelter. Any application to acquire or build noncongregate shelter in accordance with this section must receive priority over applicants for other types of shelter.

## Section 4
1. Each county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, and each city within such county, that purchases a hotel, as defined in RCW 19.48.010, with public funds for purposes of providing emergency housing or emergency shelter must limit the use and occupancy of such housing and shelters to the following:

    a. Persons with disabilities experiencing homelessness;

    b. Families experiencing homelessness including, but not limited to, pregnant women;

    c. Persons aged 60 years or more experiencing homelessness; or

    d. Other persons subject to the following conditions:

        i. Payment of no more than 30 percent of their annual median income toward rent or providing at least 24 hours of community service; and

        ii. Stays are limited for no longer than 90 days except between November and February.

2. Each planning county and each city within such county must provide employment, mental health, drug counseling service, and job training opportunities and services at each emergency housing and shelter described under subsection (1) of this section.

## Section 5
1. The department of commerce must convene a work group to make recommendations on additional requirements for reporting of data concerning persons experiencing homelessness to ensure that the state has the necessary information regarding persons experiencing homelessness who take advantage of housing, substance abuse treatment, mental health, or employment services to make informed decisions regarding prioritization of spending to make the most impact on reducing homelessness in Washington state.

2. The work group must include relevant stakeholders including, but not limited to, homeless rights representatives, service provider representatives, and representatives from cities and counties.

3. The work group must meet at least three times and evaluate the following:

    a. An overview of the collection methods and data currently reported in the state homeless management information system;

    b. The extent to which additional information should be collected and made disclosable in the state homeless management information system or in a separate database accessible by service providers;

    c. The need to implement a registration requirement over time and across specific state regions, and any challenges in identifying persons who travel from region to region;

    d. Which types of persons experiencing homelessness should be exempted from a statewide registration requirement;

    e. The use of the state homeless management information system or a separate statewide registration program database to prioritize provision of services to persons most likely to benefit;

    f. The feasibility of requiring service providers to report participation data as part of the state homeless management information system or a separate statewide registration program;

    g. How to collect data regarding the number of persons:

        i. With mental health disorders who are offered services and accept or decline such services;

        ii. With substance abuse disorders who are offered sobriety programs and accept or decline such program services;

        iii. Offered employment services and who accept or decline such services; and

## Section 6
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 7 and 8, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 7 and 8 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a) and (c).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage the employment of certain unemployed persons, such as persons convicted of a felony and homeless persons. It is the legislature's intent to provide employers a credit against the business and occupation tax or public utility tax for hiring certain unemployed persons which would reduce an employer's tax burden thereby inducing employers to hire and create jobs for such persons. Pursuant to chapter 43.136 RCW, the joint legislative audit and review committee must review the business and occupation tax and public utility tax credit established under sections 7 and 8, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 7 and 8 of this act) by December 31, 2032.

4. If a review finds that the number of unemployed persons who meet the criteria in section 7(7)(c)(i) or 8(7)(c)(i) of this act decreased by 30 percent, then the legislature intends for the legislative auditor to recommend extending the expiration date of the tax preference.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee should refer to unemployment rates available from the employment security department and the bureau of labor statistics.
