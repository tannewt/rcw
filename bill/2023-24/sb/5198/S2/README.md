# SB 5198 - Mobile home community sales

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5198-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Manufactured/mobile homes provide a significant source of homeownership opportunities for Washington state residents. However, the increasing number of closures and conversions to other uses of manufactured housing communities and mobile home parks, combined with low vacancy rates in existing parks and communities and the extremely high cost of moving homes when these parks and communities close, make this type of affordable housing option increasingly insecure for the tenants who reside in these parks and communities.

    b. Many tenants who reside in these parks and communities are senior citizens or low-income households and are, therefore, the residents most in need of reasonable security or permanency in the siting of their home because of the adverse impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of tenants forced to move due to closure or conversion to another use of the manufactured housing community or mobile home park.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to encourage and facilitate the preservation of existing manufactured/mobile home communities in the event of voluntary sales of the manufactured/mobile home communities and, to the extent necessary and possible, involve manufactured/mobile home community tenants or an eligible organization, such as a nonprofit organization, housing authority, community land trust, resident nonprofit cooperative, or local government, in the preservation of manufactured/mobile home communities.

3. The legislature further finds that when the sale of a manufactured/mobile home park to the community tenants or an eligible organization is not possible, a minimum notification period of two years before the closure or conversion of a community or park is a reasonable balancing of the rights and interests of both community and park owners and the manufactured/mobile home owners, unless the owners justly compensate the homeowners for the loss of their homes.

## Section 2
For purposes of this chapter:

## Section 3
1. Any mobile home space tenancy regardless of the term, shall be based upon a written rental agreement, signed by the parties, which shall contain:

    b. Reasonable rules for guest parking which shall be clearly stated;

    c. The rules and regulations of the park;

    d. The name and address of the person who is the landlord, and if such person does not reside in the state there shall also be designated by name and address a person who resides in the county where the mobile home park is located who is authorized to act as agent for the purposes of service of notices and process. If no designation is made of a person to act as agent, then the person to whom rental payments are to be made shall be considered the agent;

    e. The name and address of any party who has a secured interest in the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model;

    f. A forwarding address of the tenant or the name and address of a person who would likely know the whereabouts of the tenant in the event of an emergency or an abandonment of the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model;

    j. A listing of the utilities, services, and facilities which will be available to the tenant during the tenancy and the nature of the fees, if any, to be charged together with a statement that, in the event any utilities are changed to be charged independent of the rent during the term of the rental agreement, the landlord agrees to decrease the amount of the rent charged proportionately;

    k. A written description, picture, plan, or map of the boundaries of a mobile home space sufficient to inform the tenant of the exact location of the tenant's space in relation to other tenants' spaces;

    l. A written description, picture, plan, or map of the location of the tenant's responsibility for utility hook-ups, consistent with RCW 59.20.130(6);

    m. A statement of the current zoning of the land on which the mobile home park is located;

    n. A statement of the expiration date of any conditional use, temporary use, or other land use permit subject to a fixed expiration date that is necessary for the continued use of the land as a mobile home park; and

    o. A written statement containing accurate historical information regarding the past five years' rental amount charged for the lot or space.

2. Any rental agreement executed between the landlord and tenant shall not contain any provision:

    a. Which allows the landlord to charge a fee for guest parking unless a violation of the rules for guest parking occurs: PROVIDED, That a fee may be charged for guest parking which covers an extended period of time as defined in the rental agreement;

    b. Which authorizes the towing or impounding of a vehicle except upon notice to the owner thereof or the tenant whose guest is the owner of the vehicle;

    c. Which allows the landlord to alter the due date for rent payment or increase the rent: (i) During the term of the rental agreement if the term is less than two years, or (ii) more frequently than annually if the initial term is for two years or more: PROVIDED, That a rental agreement may include an escalation clause for a pro rata share of any increase in the mobile home park's real property taxes or utility assessments or charges, over the base taxes or utility assessments or charges of the year in which the rental agreement took effect, if the clause also provides for a pro rata reduction in rent or other charges in the event of a reduction in real property taxes or utility assessments or charges, below the base year: PROVIDED FURTHER, That a rental agreement for a term exceeding two years may provide for annual increases in rent in specified amounts or by a formula specified in such agreement. Any rent increase authorized under this subsection (2)(c) that occurs within the closure notice period pursuant to RCW 59.20.080(1)(e) may not be more than one percentage point above the United States consumer price index for all urban consumers, housing component, published by the United States bureau of labor statistics in the periodical "Monthly Labor Review and Handbook of Labor Statistics" as established annually by the department of commerce;

    d. By which the tenant agrees to waive or forego rights or remedies under this chapter;

    e. Allowing the landlord to charge an "entrance fee" or an "exit fee." However, an entrance fee may be charged as part of a continuing care contract as defined in RCW 70.38.025;

    f. Which allows the landlord to charge a fee for guests: PROVIDED, That a landlord may establish rules charging for guests who remain on the premises for more than 15 days in any 60-day period;

    g. By which the tenant agrees to waive or forego homestead rights provided by chapter 6.13 RCW. This subsection shall not prohibit such waiver after a default in rent so long as such waiver is in writing signed by the husband and wife or by an unmarried claimant and in consideration of the landlord's agreement not to terminate the tenancy for a period of time specified in the waiver if the landlord would be otherwise entitled to terminate the tenancy under this chapter;

    h. By which, at the time the rental agreement is entered into, the landlord and tenant agree to the selection of a particular arbitrator; or

    i. By which the tenant agrees to make rent payments through electronic means only.

3. Any provision prohibited under this section that is included in a rental agreement is unenforceable.

## Section 4
1. Any rental agreement shall be assignable by the tenant to any person to whom he or she sells or transfers title to the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model.

2. A tenant who sells a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model within a park must provide the buyer with a copy of a closure notice provided by the landlord pursuant to RCW 59.20.080, if such notice is in effect, at least 15 days in advance of the intended sale and transfer.

3. A tenant who sells a mobile home, manufactured home, or park model within a park shall notify the landlord in writing of the date of the intended sale and transfer of the rental agreement at least 15 days in advance of such intended transfer and shall notify the buyer in writing of the provisions of this section. The tenant shall verify in writing to the landlord payment of all taxes, rent, and reasonable expenses due on the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model and mobile home lot. The tenant shall notify the buyer of all taxes, rent, and reasonable expenses due on the manufactured/mobile home or park model and the mobile home lot.

4. At least seven days in advance of such intended transfer, the landlord shall:

    a. Notify the selling tenant, in writing, of a refusal to permit transfer of the rental agreement; or

    b. If the landlord approves of the transfer, provide the buyer with copies of the written rental agreement, the rules and regulations, and all other documents related to the tenancy. A landlord may not accept payment for rent or deposit from the buyer until the landlord has provided the buyer with these copies.

5. The landlord may require the mobile home, manufactured home, or park model to meet applicable fire and safety standards if a state or local agency responsible for the enforcement of fire and safety standards has issued a notice of violation of those standards to the tenant and those violations remain uncorrected. Upon correction of the violation to the satisfaction of the state or local agency responsible for the enforcement of that notice of violation, the landlord's refusal to permit the transfer is deemed withdrawn.

6. The landlord shall approve or disapprove of the assignment of a rental agreement on the same basis that the landlord approves or disapproves of any new tenant, and any disapproval shall be in writing. Consent to an assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld.

7. Failure to notify the landlord in writing, as required under subsection (3) of this section; or failure of the new tenant to make a good faith attempt to arrange an interview with the landlord to discuss assignment of the rental agreement; or failure of the current or new tenant to obtain written approval of the landlord for assignment of the rental agreement, shall be grounds for disapproval of such transfer.

## Section 5
1. A landlord shall not terminate or fail to renew a tenancy of a tenant or the occupancy of an occupant, of whatever duration except for one or more of the following reasons:

    a. In accordance with RCW 59.20.045(6), substantial violation, or repeated or periodic violations, of an enforceable rule of the mobile home park as established by the landlord at the inception of or during the tenancy or for violation of the tenant's duties as provided in RCW 59.20.140. The tenant shall be given written notice to cease the rule violation immediately. The notice shall state that failure to cease the violation of the rule or any subsequent violation of that or any other rule shall result in termination of the tenancy, and that the tenant shall vacate the premises within twenty days: PROVIDED, That for a periodic violation the notice shall also specify that repetition of the same violation shall result in termination: PROVIDED FURTHER, That in the case of a violation of a "material change" in park rules with respect to pets, tenants with minor children living with them, or recreational facilities, the tenant shall be given written notice under this chapter of a six month period in which to comply or vacate;

    b. Nonpayment of rent or other charges specified in the rental agreement, upon 14 days written notice to pay rent and/or other charges or to vacate;

    c. Conviction of the tenant of a crime, commission of which threatens the health, safety, or welfare of the other mobile home park tenants. The tenant shall be given written notice of a 15-day period in which to vacate;

    d. Failure of the tenant to comply with local ordinances and state laws and regulations relating to mobile homes, manufactured homes, or park models or mobile home, manufactured homes, or park model living within a reasonable time after the tenant's receipt of notice of such noncompliance from the appropriate governmental agency;

    e. Change of land use of the mobile home park including, but not limited to, closure of the mobile home park or conversion to a use other than for mobile homes, manufactured homes, or park models or conversion of the mobile home park to a mobile home park cooperative or mobile home park subdivision. The landlord shall give the tenants two years' notice, in the form of a closure notice meeting the requirements of RCW 59.21.030, in advance of the effective date of such change. The two-year closure notice requirement does not apply if:

        i. The mobile home park or manufactured housing community has been acquired for or is under imminent threat of condemnation;

        ii. The mobile home park or manufactured housing community is sold or transferred to a county in order to reduce conflicting residential uses near a military installation;

        iii. The mobile home park or manufactured housing community is sold to an eligible organization ;

        iv. The landlord provides relocation assistance of at least $15,000 for a multisection home or of at least $10,000 for a single section home, establishes a simple, straightforward, and timely process for compensating the tenants for the loss of their homes and actually compensates the tenants for the loss of their homes, at the greater of 50 percent of their assessed market value in the tax year prior to the notice of closure being issued, or $5,000, at any point during the closure notice period and prior to a change of use or sale of the property. At such time as the compensation is paid, the tenant shall be given written notice of at least 12 months in which to vacate, and the tenant shall continue to pay rent for as much time as he or she remains in the mobile home park or manufactured housing community. Nothing in this subsection (1)(e)(iv) prevents a tenant from relocating his or her home out of the mobile home park or manufactured housing community pursuant to chapter 59.21 RCW. In the event that a home remains in the mobile home park or manufactured housing community after a tenant vacates, the landlord shall be responsible for its demolition or disposal. A landlord is still eligible for demolition and disposal costs pursuant to RCW 59.21.021. Homeowners who receive payments or financial assistance from landlords as described in this subsection (1)(e)(iv) remain eligible to receive other state assistance for which they may be eligible including, but not limited to, relocation assistance funds pursuant to RCW 59.21.021; or

    v. The landlord provides relocation assistance of at least $15,000 for a multisection home and of at least $10,000 for a single section home at any point during the closure notice period and prior to a change of use or sale of the property. At such time as the assistance is paid, the tenant shall be given written notice of at least 18 months in which to vacate, and the tenant shall continue to pay rent for as much time as he or she remains in the mobile home park or manufactured housing community. Nothing in this subsection (1)(e)(v) prevents a tenant from relocating his or her home out of the mobile home park or manufactured housing community pursuant to chapter 59.21 RCW. In the event that a home remains in the mobile home park or manufactured housing community after a tenant vacates, the landlord shall be responsible for its demolition or disposal. A landlord is still eligible for demolition and disposal costs pursuant to RCW 59.21.021. Homeowners who receive payments or financial assistance from landlords as described in this subsection (1)(e)(v) remain eligible to receive other state assistance for which they may be eligible including, but not limited to, relocation assistance funds pursuant to RCW 59.21.021;

    f. Engaging in "criminal activity." "Criminal activity" means a criminal act defined by statute or ordinance that threatens the health, safety, or welfare of the tenants. A park owner seeking to evict a tenant or occupant under this subsection need not produce evidence of a criminal conviction, even if the alleged misconduct constitutes a criminal offense. Notice from a law enforcement agency of criminal activity constitutes sufficient grounds, but not the only grounds, for an eviction under this subsection. Notification of the seizure of illegal drugs under RCW 59.20.155 is evidence of criminal activity and is grounds for an eviction under this subsection. The requirement that any tenant or occupant register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.130 is grounds for eviction of the sex offender under this subsection. If criminal activity is alleged to be a basis of termination, the park owner may proceed directly to an unlawful detainer action;

    g. The tenant's application for tenancy contained a material misstatement that induced the park owner to approve the tenant as a resident of the park, and the park owner discovers and acts upon the misstatement within one year of the time the resident began paying rent;

    h. If the landlord serves a tenant three 20-day notices, each of which was valid under (a) of this subsection at the time of service, within a 12-month period to comply or vacate for failure to comply with the material terms of the rental agreement or an enforceable park rule, other than failure to pay rent by the due date. The applicable 12-month period shall commence on the date of the first violation;

    i. Failure of the tenant to comply with obligations imposed upon tenants by applicable provisions of municipal, county, and state codes, statutes, ordinances, and regulations, including this chapter. The landlord shall give the tenant written notice to comply immediately. The notice must state that failure to comply will result in termination of the tenancy and that the tenant shall vacate the premises within 15 days;

    j. The tenant engages in disorderly or substantially annoying conduct upon the park premises that results in the destruction of the rights of others to the peaceful enjoyment and use of the premises. The landlord shall give the tenant written notice to comply immediately. The notice must state that failure to comply will result in termination of the tenancy and that the tenant shall vacate the premises within 15 days;

    k. The tenant creates a nuisance that materially affects the health, safety, and welfare of other park residents. The landlord shall give the tenant written notice to cease the conduct that constitutes a nuisance immediately. The notice must describe the nuisance and state (i) what the tenant must do to cease the nuisance and (ii) that failure to cease the conduct will result in termination of the tenancy and that the tenant shall vacate the premises in five days;

    l. Any other substantial just cause that materially affects the health, safety, and welfare of other park residents. The landlord shall give the tenant written notice to comply immediately. The notice must describe the harm caused by the tenant, describe what the tenant must do to comply and to discontinue the harm, and state that failure to comply will result in termination of the tenancy and that the tenant shall vacate the premises within 15 days; or

    m. Failure to pay rent by the due date provided for in the rental agreement three or more times in a 12-month period, commencing with the date of the first violation, after service of a 14-day notice to comply or vacate.

2. Within five days of a notice of eviction as required by subsection (1)(a) of this section, the landlord and tenant shall submit any dispute to mediation. The parties may agree in writing to mediation by an independent third party or through industry mediation procedures. If the parties cannot agree, then mediation shall be through industry mediation procedures. A duty is imposed upon both parties to participate in the mediation process in good faith for a period of 10 days for an eviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section. It is a defense to an eviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section that a landlord did not participate in the mediation process in good faith.

3. Except for a tenant evicted under subsection (1)(c) or (f) of this section, a tenant evicted from a mobile home park under this section shall be allowed 120 days within which to sell the tenant's mobile home, manufactured home, or park model in place within the mobile home park: PROVIDED, That the tenant remains current in the payment of rent incurred after eviction, and pays any past due rent, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs at the time the rental agreement is assigned. The provisions of RCW 59.20.073 regarding transfer of rental agreements apply.

4. Chapters 59.12 and 59.18 RCW govern the eviction of recreational vehicles, as defined in RCW 59.20.030, from mobile home parks. This chapter governs the eviction of mobile homes, manufactured homes, park models, and recreational vehicles used as a primary residence from a mobile home park.

## Section 6
1. A landlord must provide a written notice of sale of a manufactured/mobile home community by certified mail or personal delivery to:

    a. Each tenant of the manufactured/mobile home community;

    b. The officers of any known qualified tenant organization;

    c. The office of mobile/manufactured home relocation assistance;

## Section 7
No county, city, town, or municipality of any class may enact, maintain, or enforce ordinances or other provisions that regulate the same matters in sections 8 through 12 of this act. Local laws and ordinances that regulate the same matters as in sections 8 through 12 of this act shall not be enacted and are preempted and repealed, regardless of the nature of the code, charter, or home rule status of such city, town, county, or municipality, except for those local laws already in effect before May 1, 2023.

## Section 8
1. An owner shall give written notice of an opportunity to compete to purchase indicating the owner's interest in selling the manufactured/mobile home community before the owner markets the manufactured/mobile home community for sale or includes the sale of the manufactured/mobile home community in a multiple listing, and when the owner receives an offer to purchase that the owner intends to consider.

2. The owner shall give the notice in subsection (1) of this section by certified mail or personal delivery to:

4. The representative or representatives of the tenants committee will be able to request park operating expenses described in section 9 of this act from the owner within a 15-day information period following delivery of the qualified tenant organization's notice to the owner indicating interest in competing to purchase the manufactured/mobile home community.

5. An eligible organization may also compete to purchase and is subject to the same time constraints and applicable conditions as a qualified tenant organization.

## Section 9
1. Within 70 days after delivery of the notice of the opportunity to compete to purchase the manufactured/mobile home community described in section 8 of this act, if the tenants choose to compete to purchase the manufactured/mobile home community in which the tenants reside, the tenants must notify the owner in writing of:

    a. The tenants' interest in competing to purchase the manufactured/mobile home community;

    b. Their formation or identification of a single qualified tenant organization made up of a majority of the tenants in the community, based on home sites, formed for the purpose of purchasing the manufactured/mobile home community; and

    c. The name and contact information of the representative or representatives of the qualified tenant organization with whom the owner may communicate about the purchase.

2. The tenants may only have one qualified tenant organization for the purpose of purchasing the manufactured/mobile home community, but they may partner with a nonprofit or a housing authority to act with or for them subject to the same timelines, duties, and obligations that would apply to tenants and qualified tenant organizations under this act.

3. Within 15 days following delivery of the notice in subsection (1) of this section from the tenants to the owner:

    a. The designated representative or representatives of the qualified tenant organization may make a written request to the owner for:

        i. The asking price for the manufactured/mobile home community, if any; and

    d. Unless waived by the provider, information provided pursuant to this subsection shall be kept confidential, and a list must be created of persons with whom the tenants may share information who will also keep provided information confidential, including any of the following persons that are either seeking to purchase the manufactured/mobile home community on behalf of the tenants or assisting the qualified tenant organization in evaluating or purchasing the manufactured/mobile home community:

        i. A nonprofit organization or a housing authority;

        ii. An attorney or other licensed professional or adviser; and

    b. If the parties reach agreement on the purchase, the purchase and sale agreement must specify the price, due diligence duties, schedules, timelines, conditions, and any extensions.

    c. If the offer is rejected, then the owner must provide a written explanation of why the offer is being rejected and what terms and conditions might be included in a subsequent offer for the landlord to potentially accept it, if any. The price, terms, and conditions of an acceptable offer stated in the response must be universal and applicable to all potential buyers and must not be specific to and prohibitive of a qualified tenant organization or eligible organization making a successful offer to purchase the park.

    d. If the tenants do not: (i) Act as required within the time periods described in this act; (ii) violate the confidentiality agreement described in this section; or (iii) reach agreement on a purchase with the owner, the owner is not obligated to take additional action under this act and may record an affidavit pursuant to section 12 of this act.

6. An eligible organization acting on its own behalf is also subject to the same requirements and applicable conditions as those set out in this section.

## Section 10
1. During the process described in sections 8 and 9 of this act, the parties shall act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, which includes a duty for the tenants to notify the owner promptly if there is no intent to purchase the manufactured/mobile home community or the property on which it sits. The parties have an overall duty to act in good faith. With respect to negotiation, this overall duty of good faith requirement means that the owner must allow the tenants to develop an offer, must give their offer reasonable consideration, and must inform the tenants if a higher offer is submitted. Furthermore, the owner may not deny residents the same access to the community and to information, such as operating expenses and rent rolls, that the landowner would give to a commercial buyer. With respect to financial information, all parties shall agree to keep this information confidential.

2. Except as provided in section 11(1) of this act, before selling a manufactured/mobile home community to an entity that is not formed by or associated with the tenants, or to an eligible organization, the owner of the manufactured/mobile home community must give the notice required by section 8 of this act and comply with the requirements of section 9 of this act.

3. A minor error in providing the notice required by section 8 of this act or in providing operating expenses information required by section 9 of this act does not prevent the owner from selling the manufactured/mobile home community to an entity that is not formed by or associated with the tenants and does not cause the owner to be liable to the tenants for damages or a penalty.

4. During the process described in sections 8 and 9 of this act, the owner may seek, negotiate with, or enter into a contract subject to the rights of the tenants in this act with potential purchasers other than the tenants or an entity formed by or associated with the tenants or another eligible organization.

5. If the owner does not comply with the requirements of this act in a substantial way that prevents the tenants or an eligible organization from competing to purchase the manufactured/mobile home community, the tenants or eligible organization may:

    a. Obtain injunctive relief to prevent a sale or transfer to an entity that is not formed by or associated with the tenants; and

    b. Recover actual damages not to exceed twice the monthly rent from the owner for each tenant.

6. If a party misuses or discloses, in a substantial way, confidential information in violation of section 9 of this act, that party may recover actual damages from the other party.

7. The department of commerce shall prepare and make available information for tenants about purchasing a manufactured dwelling or manufactured/mobile home community.

## Section 11
1. With regard to a sale or transfer of a manufactured/mobile home community, sections 8 and 9 of this act do not apply to any:

    a. Sale or transfer to an individual identified in RCW 11.04.015 if the owner of the manufactured/mobile home community dies intestate;

    b. Transfer by gift, devise, or operation of law;

    c. Transfer by a corporation to an affiliate;

    d. Transfer by a partnership to any of its partners;

    e. Transfer among the shareholders who own a manufactured/mobile home community;

    f. Transfer to a member of the owner's family or to a trust for the sole benefit of members of the owner's family;

    g. Sale or transfer of less than a controlling interest in the legal entity that owns the manufactured/mobile home community;

    h. Conveyance of an interest in a manufactured/mobile home community incidental to the financing of the mobile home park;

    i. Sale or transfer between or among joint tenants or tenants in common owning a manufactured/mobile home community;

    j. Bona fide exchange of a manufactured/mobile home community for other real property under section 1031 of the internal revenue code, as long as, at the time the manufactured/mobile home community owner lists the property or receives an offer for the manufactured/mobile home community, the owner has already commenced the exchange by the purchase of a property through a qualified exchange agent. In that circumstance, the owner has a deadline for selling the manufactured/mobile home community in order to gain the 1031 tax benefits; and
