## Section 40
1. Consistent with the goals established in RCW 74.09.402, through the apple health for kids program authorized in this section, the authority shall provide affordable health care coverage to children under the age of nineteen who reside in Washington state and whose family income at the time of enrollment is not greater than 260 percent of the federal poverty level as adjusted for family size and determined annually by the federal department of health and human services, and effective January 1, 2009, and only to the extent that funds are specifically appropriated therefor, to children whose family income is not greater than 312 percent of the federal poverty level. In administering the program, the authority shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure the receipt of federal financial participation under the medical assistance program, as codified at Title XIX of the federal social security act, the state children's health insurance program, as codified at Title XXI of the federal social security act, and any other federal funding sources that are now available or may become available in the future. The authority and the caseload forecast council shall estimate the anticipated caseload and costs of the program established in this section.

2. The authority shall accept applications for enrollment for children's health care coverage; establish appropriate minimum-enrollment periods, as may be necessary; and determine eligibility based on current family income. The authority shall make eligibility determinations within the time frames for establishing eligibility for children on medical assistance, as defined by RCW 74.09.510. The application and annual renewal processes shall be designed to minimize administrative barriers for applicants and enrolled clients, and to minimize gaps in eligibility for families who are eligible for coverage. If a change in family income results in a change in the source of funding for coverage, the authority shall transfer the family members to the appropriate source of funding and notify the family with respect to any change in premium obligation, without a break in eligibility. The authority shall use the same eligibility redetermination and appeals procedures as those provided for children on medical assistance programs. The authority shall modify its eligibility renewal procedures to lower the percentage of children failing to annually renew. The authority shall manage its outreach, application, and renewal procedures with the goals of: (a) Achieving year by year improvements in enrollment, enrollment rates, renewals, and renewal rates; (b) maximizing the use of existing program databases to obtain information related to earned and unearned income for purposes of eligibility determination and renewals, including, but not limited to, the basic food program, the child care subsidy program, federal social security administration programs, and the employment security department wage database; (c) streamlining renewal processes to rely primarily upon data matches, online submissions, and telephone interviews; and (d) implementing any other eligibility determination and renewal processes to allow the state to receive an enhanced federal matching rate and additional federal outreach funding available through the federal children's health insurance program reauthorization act of 2009 by January 2010. The department shall advise the governor and the legislature regarding the status of these efforts by September 30, 2009. The information provided should include the status of the department's efforts, the anticipated impact of those efforts on enrollment, and the costs associated with that enrollment.

3. To ensure continuity of care and ease of understanding for families and health care providers, and to maximize the efficiency of the program, the amount, scope, and duration of health care services provided to children under this section shall be the same as that provided to children under medical assistance, as defined in RCW 74.09.520.

4. The primary mechanism for purchasing health care coverage under this section shall be through contracts with managed health care systems as defined in RCW 74.09.522, subject to conditions, limitations, and appropriations provided in the biennial appropriations act. However, the authority shall make every effort within available resources to purchase health care coverage for uninsured children whose families have access to dependent coverage through an employer-sponsored health plan or another source when it is cost-effective for the state to do so, and the purchase is consistent with requirements of Title XIX and Title XXI of the federal social security act. To the extent allowable under federal law, the authority shall require families to enroll in available employer-sponsored coverage, as a condition of participating in the program established under this section, when it is cost-effective for the state to do so. Families who enroll in available employer- sponsored coverage under this section shall be accounted for separately in the annual report required by RCW 74.09.053.

5. [Empty]

    a. To reflect appropriate parental responsibility, the authority shall develop and implement a schedule of premiums for children's health care coverage due to the authority from families with income greater than 210 percent of the federal poverty level. For families with income greater than 260 percent of the federal poverty level, the premiums shall be established in consultation with the senate majority and minority leaders and the speaker and minority leader of the house of representatives. For children eligible for coverage under the federally funded children's health insurance program, Title XXI of the federal social security act, premiums shall be set at a reasonable level that does not pose a barrier to enrollment. The amount of the premium shall be based upon family income and shall not exceed the premium limitations in Title XXI of the federal social security act. For children who are not eligible for coverage under the federally funded children's health insurance program, premiums shall be set every two years in an amount no greater than the average state-only share of the per capita cost of coverage in the state-funded children's health program.

    b. Premiums shall not be imposed on children in households at or below 210 percent of the federal poverty level as articulated in RCW 74.09.055.

    c. The authority shall offer families whose income is greater than 312 percent of the federal poverty level the opportunity to purchase health care coverage for their children through the programs administered under this section without an explicit premium subsidy from the state. The design of the health benefit package offered to these children should provide a benefit package substantially similar to that offered in the apple health for kids program, and may differ with respect to cost-sharing, and other appropriate elements from that provided to children under subsection (3) of this section including, but not limited to, application of preexisting conditions, waiting periods, and other design changes needed to offer affordable coverage. The amount paid by the family shall be in an amount equal to the rate paid by the state to the managed health care system for coverage of the child, including any associated and administrative costs to the state of providing coverage for the child. Any pooling of the program enrollees that results in state fiscal impact must be identified and brought to the legislature for consideration.

6. The authority shall undertake and continue a proactive, targeted outreach and education effort with the goal of enrolling children in health coverage and improving the health literacy of youth and parents. The authority shall collaborate with the department of social and health services, department of health, local public health jurisdictions, the office of the superintendent of public instruction, the department of children, youth, and families, health educators, health care providers, health carriers, community-based organizations, and parents in the design and development of this effort. The outreach and education effort shall include the following components:

    a. Broad dissemination of information about the availability of coverage, including media campaigns;

    b. Assistance with completing applications, and community-based outreach efforts to help people apply for coverage. Community-based outreach efforts should be targeted to the populations least likely to be covered;

    c. Use of existing systems, such as enrollment information from the free and reduced‑price lunch program, the department of children, youth, and families child care subsidy program, the department of health's women, infants, and children program, and the early childhood education and assistance program, to identify children who may be eligible but not enrolled in coverage;

    d. Contracting with community-based organizations and government entities to support community-based outreach efforts to help families apply for coverage. These efforts should be targeted to the populations least likely to be covered. The authority shall provide informational materials for use by government entities and community-based organizations in their outreach activities, and should identify any available federal matching funds to support these efforts;

    e. Development and dissemination of materials to engage and inform parents and families statewide on issues such as: The benefits of health insurance coverage; the appropriate use of health services, including primary care provided by health care practitioners licensed under chapters 18.71, 18.57, 18.36A, and 18.79 RCW, and emergency services; the value of a medical home, well-child services and immunization, and other preventive health services with linkages to department of health child profile efforts; identifying and managing chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes; and the value of good nutrition and physical activity;

    f. An evaluation of the outreach and education efforts, based upon clear, cost-effective outcome measures that are included in contracts with entities that undertake components of the outreach and education effort;

    g. An implementation plan to develop online application capability that is integrated with the automated client eligibility system, and to develop data linkages with the office of the superintendent of public instruction for free and reduced‑price lunch enrollment information and the department of children, youth, and families for child care subsidy program enrollment information.

7. The authority shall take action to increase the number of primary care physicians providing dental disease preventive services including oral health screenings, risk assessment, family education, the application of fluoride varnish, and referral to a dentist as needed.

8. The department shall monitor the rates of substitution between private‑sector health care coverage and the coverage provided under this section.

## Section 41
For apple health for kids, the department shall not count the twenty-five dollar increase paid as part of an individual's weekly benefit amount  when determining family income, eligibility, and payment levels.

## Section 42
1. The authority, in collaboration with the department of health, department of social and health services, health carriers, local public health jurisdictions, children's health care providers including pediatricians, family practitioners, advanced registered nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and pediatric subspecialists, community and migrant health centers, parents, and other purchasers, shall establish a concise set of explicit performance measures that can indicate whether children enrolled in the program are receiving health care through an established and effective medical home, and whether the overall health of enrolled children is improving. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to:

    a. Childhood immunization rates;

    b. Well child care utilization rates, including the use of behavioral and oral health screening, and validated, structured developmental screens using tools, that are consistent with nationally accepted pediatric guidelines and recommended administration schedule, once funding is specifically appropriated for this purpose;

    c. Care management for children with chronic illnesses;

    d. Emergency room utilization;

    e. Visual acuity and eye health;

    f. Preventive oral health service utilization; and

    g. Children's mental health status. In defining these measures the authority shall be guided by the measures provided in RCW 71.36.025.

Performance measures and targets for each performance measure must be established and monitored each biennium, with a goal of achieving measurable, improved health outcomes for the children of Washington state each biennium.

2. Beginning in calendar year 2009, targeted provider rate increases shall be linked to quality improvement measures established under this section. The authority, in conjunction with those groups identified in subsection (1) of this section, shall develop parameters for determining criteria for increased payment, alternative payment methodologies, or other incentives for those practices and health plans that incorporate evidence-based practice  and achieve sustained improvement with respect to the measures.

3. The department shall provide a report to the governor and the legislature related to provider performance on these measures, as well as the information collected under RCW 74.09.475, beginning in September 2010 for 2007 through 2009 and the authority shall provide the report biennially thereafter.

## Section 43
1. For the purposes of this section

, "nonparticipating provider" means a person, health care provider, practitioner, facility, or entity, acting within their scope of practice, that does not have a written contract to participate in a managed  care organization's provider network, but provides health care services to enrollees of programs authorized under this chapter or other applicable law whose health care services are provided by the managed  care organization.

2. The authority shall enter into agreements with managed  care organizations to provide health care services to recipients of medicaid under the following conditions:

    a. Agreements shall be made for at least thirty thousand recipients statewide;

    b. Agreements in at least one county shall include enrollment of all recipients of programs as allowed for in the approved state plan amendment or federal waiver for Washington state's medicaid program;

To the extent that this provision is consistent with section 1903(m) of Title XIX of the federal social security act or federal demonstration waivers granted under section 1115(a) of Title XI of the federal social security act, recipients shall have a choice of systems in which to enroll and shall have the right to terminate their enrollment in a system: PROVIDED, That the authority may limit recipient termination of enrollment without cause to the first month of a period of enrollment, which period shall not exceed twelve months: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That the authority shall not restrict a recipient's right to terminate enrollment in a system for good cause as established by the authority by rule;

    d. To the extent that this provision is consistent with section 1903(m) of Title XIX of the federal social security act, participating managed  care organizations shall not enroll a disproportionate number of medical assistance recipients within the total numbers of persons served by the managed  care organizations, except as authorized by the authority under federal demonstration waivers granted under section 1115(a) of Title XI of the federal social security act;

    e. [Empty]

        i. In negotiating with managed  care organizations the authority shall adopt a uniform procedure to enter into contractual arrangements, including:

        ii.(A) Health home services contracted for under this subsection may be prioritized to enrollees with complex, high cost, or multiple chronic conditions.

(B) Contracts that include the items in (e)(i)(C) through (G) of this subsection must not exceed the rates that would be paid in the absence of these provisions;

    f. The authority shall seek waivers from federal requirements as necessary to implement this chapter;

The authority shall coordinate its managed care activities with activities under chapter 70.47 RCW.

4. The authority shall work jointly with the state of Oregon and other states in this geographical region in order to develop recommendations to be presented to the appropriate federal agencies and the United States congress for improving health care of the poor, while controlling related costs.

5. The legislature finds that competition in the managed health care marketplace is enhanced, in the long term, by the existence of a large number of managed  care organization options for medicaid clients. In a managed care delivery system, whose goal is to focus on prevention, primary care, and improved enrollee health status, continuity in care relationships is of substantial importance, and disruption to clients and health care providers should be minimized. To help ensure these goals are met, the following principles shall guide the authority in its healthy options managed health care purchasing efforts:

    a. All managed  care organizations should have an opportunity to contract with the authority to the extent that minimum contracting requirements defined by the authority are met, at payment rates that enable the authority to operate as far below appropriated spending levels as possible, consistent with the principles established in this section.

    b. Managed  care organizations should compete for the award of contracts and assignment of medicaid beneficiaries who do not voluntarily select a contracting system, based upon:

        i. Demonstrated commitment to or experience in serving low-income populations;

        ii. Quality of services provided to enrollees;

        iii. Accessibility, including appropriate utilization, of services offered to enrollees;

        iv. Demonstrated capability to perform contracted services, including ability to supply an adequate provider network;

    v. Payment rates; and

    vi. The ability to meet other specifically defined contract requirements established by the authority, including consideration of past and current performance and participation in other state or federal health programs as a contractor.

    c. Consideration should be given to using multiple year contracting periods.

    d. Quality, accessibility, and demonstrated commitment to serving low-income populations shall be given significant weight in the contracting, evaluation, and assignment process.

    e. All contractors that are regulated health carriers must meet state minimum net worth requirements as defined in applicable state laws. The authority shall adopt rules establishing the minimum net worth requirements for contractors that are not regulated health carriers. This subsection does not limit the authority of the Washington state health care authority to take action under a contract upon finding that a contractor's financial status seriously jeopardizes the contractor's ability to meet its contract obligations.

    f. Procedures for resolution of disputes between the authority and contract bidders or the authority and contracting carriers related to the award of, or failure to award, a managed care contract must be clearly set out in the procurement document.

6. The authority may apply the principles set forth in subsection (5) of this section to its managed health care purchasing efforts on behalf of clients receiving supplemental security income benefits to the extent appropriate.

7. Any contract with a managed  care organization to provide services to medical assistance enrollees shall require that managed  care organizations offer contracts to mental health providers and substance use disorder treatment providers to provide access to primary care services integrated into behavioral health clinical settings, for individuals with behavioral health and medical comorbidities.

8. Managed  care organization contracts effective on or after April 1, 2016, shall serve geographic areas that correspond to the regional service areas established in RCW 74.09.870.

9. A managed  care organization shall pay a nonparticipating provider that provides a service covered under this chapter or other applicable law to the organization's enrollee no more than the lowest amount paid for that service under the managed  care organization's contracts with similar providers in the state if the managed  care organization has made good faith efforts to contract with the nonparticipating provider.

10. For services covered under this chapter or other applicable law to medical assistance or medical care services enrollees, nonparticipating providers must accept as payment in full the amount paid by the managed  care organization under subsection (9) of this section in addition to any deductible, coinsurance, or copayment that is due from the enrollee for the service provided. An enrollee is not liable to any nonparticipating provider for covered services, except for amounts due for any deductible, coinsurance, or copayment under the terms and conditions set forth in the managed  care organization contract to provide services under this section.

11. Pursuant to federal managed care access standards, 42 C.F.R. Sec. 438, managed  care organizations must maintain a network of appropriate providers that is supported by written agreements sufficient to provide adequate access to all services covered under the contract with the authority, including hospital-based physician services. The authority will monitor and periodically report on the proportion of services provided by contracted providers and nonparticipating providers, by county, for each managed  care organization to ensure that managed health care systems are meeting network adequacy requirements. No later than January 1st of each year, the authority will review and report its findings to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature for the preceding state fiscal year.

2. If the person is not enrolled in a medicaid managed care organization and does not have any other available insurance coverage, the authority must reimburse a hospital, behavioral health agency, or pharmacy for dispensing or distributing opioid overdose reversal medication under RCW 70.41.485 and 71.24.594.

## Section 46

## Section 47
1. To the extent funds are appropriated specifically for this purpose, and subject to any conditions placed on appropriations made for this purpose, the authority shall design a medicaid prescription drug assistance program. Neither the benefits of, nor eligibility for, the program is considered to be an entitlement.

2. The authority shall request any federal waiver necessary to implement this program. Consistent with federal waiver conditions, the department may charge enrollment fees, premiums, or point-of-service cost-sharing to program enrollees.

3. Eligibility for this program is limited to persons:

    a. Who are eligible for medicare or age sixty-five and older;

    b. Whose family income does not exceed two hundred percent of the federal poverty level as adjusted for family size and determined annually by the federal department of health and human services;

    c. Who lack insurance that provides prescription drug coverage; and

    d. Who are not otherwise eligible under Title XIX of the federal social security act.

4. The authority shall use a cost-effective prescription drug benefit design. Consistent with federal waiver conditions, this benefit design may be different than the benefit design offered under the medical assistance program. The benefit design may include a deductible benefit that provides coverage when enrollees incur higher prescription drug costs as defined by the department. The authority also may offer more than one benefit design.

5. The authority shall limit enrollment of persons who qualify for the program so as to prevent an overexpenditure of appropriations for this program or to assure necessary compliance with federal waiver budget neutrality requirements. The authority may not reduce existing medical assistance program eligibility or benefits to assure compliance with federal waiver budget neutrality requirements.

6. Premiums paid by medicaid enrollees not in the medicaid prescription drug assistance program may not be used to finance the medicaid prescription drug assistance program.

7. This program will be terminated within twelve months after implementation of a prescription drug benefit under Title XVIII of the federal social security act.

## Section 49
The authority shall provide coverage under this chapter for smoking cessation counseling services, as well as prescription and nonprescription agents when used to promote smoking cessation, so long as such agents otherwise meet the definition of "covered outpatient drug" in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1396r-8(k). However, the authority may initiate an individualized inquiry and determine and implement by rule appropriate coverage limitations as may be required to encourage the use of effective, evidence-based services and prescription and nonprescription agents. ‑

## Section 50
The legislature finds that:

1. Over half of all births in Washington state are covered by public programs;

2. Research has demonstrated that children of unintended pregnancies receive less prenatal care and are at higher risk for premature birth, low birth weight, neurological disorders, and poor academic performance;

3. In Washington state, over 50 percent of unintended pregnancies occur in women age 25 years and older;

4. Washington state's take charge program has been successful in helping women avoid unintended pregnancies; however, when the caseload declined due to federally mandated changes, the rate of unintended pregnancies increased dramatically;

5. Expanding family planning services to cover women to 260 percent of the federal poverty level would align that program's eligibility standard with income eligibility for publicly funded maternity care service; and

6. Such an expansion would reduce unintended pregnancies and associated costs to the state.

## Section 51
(1) The authority shall continue to submit applications for the family planning waiver program.

## Section 52
1. The authority shall issue a request for proposals to provide integrated managed health and behavioral health care for foster children receiving care through the medical assistance program. Behavioral health services provided under chapters 71.24 and 71.34 RCW must be integrated into the managed  care organization for foster children beginning January 1, 2019. The request for proposals must address the program elements described in section 110, chapter 225, Laws of 2014, including development of a service delivery system, benefit design, reimbursement mechanisms, incorporation or coordination of services currently provided by the regional support networks, and standards for contracting with health organizations. The request for proposals must be issued and completed in time for services under the integrated managed care plan to begin on October 1, 2016.

2. The parent or guardian of a child who is no longer a dependent child pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW may choose to continue in the transitional foster care eligibility category for up to twelve months following reunification with the child's parents or guardian if the child:

    a. Is under eighteen years of age;

    b. Was in foster care under the legal responsibility of the department of social and health services, the department of children, youth, and families, or a federally recognized Indian tribe located within the state; and
