Personal appearance may be accomplished using video telecommunications technology if the auditor or canvassing board chooses.

4. The challenger has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the challenged voter's registration is improper.

If either the challenger or challenged voter fails to appear at the hearing, the challenge must be resolved based on the available facts.

5. If the challenge is based on an allegation under RCW 29A.08.810(1) (a), (b), (d), or (e) and the canvassing board sustains the challenge, the voter registration shall be canceled and any challenged ballot shall not be counted. If the challenge is based on an allegation under RCW 29A.08.810(1)(c) and the canvassing board sustains the challenge, the board shall permit the voter to correct the residence address on the voter registration and any races and ballot measures on any challenged ballot that the voter would have been qualified to vote for had the registration been correct shall be counted.
