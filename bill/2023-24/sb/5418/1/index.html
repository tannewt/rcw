<ol>
<li>
<p>The &quot;prevailing rate of wage&quot; is the rate of hourly wage, usual benefits, and overtime paid in the locality, as hereinafter defined, to the majority of workers, laborers, or mechanics, in the same trade or occupation. In the event that there is not a majority in the same trade or occupation paid at the same rate, then the average rate of hourly wage and overtime paid to such laborers, workers, or mechanics in the same trade or occupation is the prevailing rate. If the wage paid by any contractor or subcontractor to laborers, workers, or mechanics on any public work is based on some period of time other than an hour, the hourly wage is mathematically determined by the number of hours worked in such period of time.</p>
</li>

An inadvertent filing or reporting error includes a contractor who, in good faith, relies on a written determination provided by the department of labor and industries and pays its workers, laborers, and mechanics accordingly, but is later found to have not paid the proper prevailing wage rate.</p>

<li>
<p>&quot;Unpaid prevailing wages&quot; or &quot;unpaid wages&quot; means the employer fails to pay all of the prevailing rate of wages owed for any workweek by the regularly established pay day for the period in which the workweek ends.

Every employer must pay all usual benefits owing to its employees by the regularly established deadline for those benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Rate of contribution&quot; means the effective annual rate of usual benefit contributions for all hours, public and private, worked during the year by an employee (commonly referred to as &quot;annualization&quot; of benefits).
