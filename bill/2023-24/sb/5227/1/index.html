<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter may be cited as the &quot;prenatal nondiscrimination act.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature of the state of Washington finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A sex-selection abortion is used to prevent the birth of a child of an undesired sex. The victims of sex-selection abortion are overwhelmingly female.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United States, along with other countries, has petitioned the United Nations general assembly to declare sex-selection abortion a crime against women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Countries such as India, Great Britain, and China have taken steps to end sex-selection abortion. For example, China and India do not allow doctors to reveal the sex of an unborn child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women are a vital part of our society and culture and possess the same fundamental human rights as men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United States prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in various areas including employment, education, athletics, and health insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is undesirable to have a sex imbalance within a society, particularly when there is a shortage of women. Countries with high rates of male-preference have experienced ill effects as a result of an increasing number of young, unmarried men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A large population of young, unmarried men can be a cause of increased violence and militancy within a society.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to ban abortions performed solely for reasons of sex selection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>

<li>
<p>&quot;Abortion&quot; means the act of using or prescribing any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other substance, device, or means with the intent to terminate the clinically diagnosable pregnancy of an individual with knowledge that the termination by those means will with reasonable likelihood cause the death of the unborn child. Such use, prescription, or means is not an abortion if done with the intent to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Save the life or preserve the health of the unborn child;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove a dead unborn child caused by spontaneous abortion; or</p>

<li>
<p>Remove an ectopic pregnancy.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In every civil proceeding or action brought under this chapter, the anonymity of the individual upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted shall be preserved from public disclosure unless consent is given to such disclosure.

<h2 id="section-11">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11">¶</a></h2>

<p>A physician, physician assistant, advanced registered nurse practitioner, or other health care provider acting within the provider's scope of practice may terminate and a health care provider may assist a physician, physician assistant, advanced registered nurse practitioner, or other health care provider acting within the provider's scope of practice in terminating a pregnancy as permitted by this section.</p>
