<p>The department of natural resources administrator shall convene a geoduck comanagement task force to investigate opportunities to reduce negative impacts to tribal treaty and state geoduck harvest in Washington state and promote long-term opportunities to expand or sustain geoduck harvest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force shall investigate the feasibility of intervention to enhance the wildstock of geoduck, including reseeding projects to improve native stocks of geoduck. An evaluation of opportunities, challenges, and financial feasibility as well as joint recommendations must be submitted as a report to the legislature and the administrator of the department of natural resources by December 1, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force shall identify and investigate the important factors preventing classification of areas for commercial harvest of wildstock geoduck or leading to existing wildstock geoduck commercial tract downgrade in classification and develop recommendations to sustainably increase the number and area of harvestable tracts. An evaluation of drivers and recommendations for most cost-effective improvements must be submitted as a report to the legislature and administrator of the department of natural resources by December 1, 2024.
