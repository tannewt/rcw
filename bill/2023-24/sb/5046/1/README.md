# SB 5046 - Postconviction counsel

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5046.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that Washington authorizes personal restraint petitions to challenge potentially unjust criminal judgments and sentences, a procedural safeguard dating back to medieval common law. The legislature further recognizes that recent statutory amendments and Washington supreme court decisions allow thousands of persons impacted by injustices in the criminal legal system to pursue resentencing.

The legislature observes that wealthy people retain attorneys to represent them in these complex, high-stakes postconviction legal proceedings. However, at least 80 percent of persons charged with felonies are indigent and cannot afford to hire a lawyer. In addition, nearly 40 percent of incarcerated persons have a cognitive or physical disability that would limit their capacity to access or understand critical legal documents, draft required petitions, or otherwise effectively represent themselves pro se in legal proceedings. Up to 70 percent of persons in prison cannot read above a fourth-grade level.

The legislature finds that the criminal legal system disproportionately incarcerates people of color, and that most people in prison are poor and the poorest are women and people of color. The legislature further finds that current law may have the effect of limiting access to counsel to initiate legitimate claims for postconviction relief. The legislature believes this situation perpetuates and exacerbates the disparate impacts of the criminal legal systems on poor persons and persons of color.

The legislature therefore declares that indigent persons must have access to public defense counsel to advise, initiate, and execute certain postconviction procedures. In addition, the legislature finds that the state should fund and administer access to counsel for certain types of postconviction procedures through the Washington state office of public defense. This act is intended to: Provide appointment of state-funded public defense counsel for indigent adults and juveniles to file and prosecute one, timely personal restraint petition; petition a sentencing court when the legislature creates an opportunity to do so; and challenge a conviction or sentence if a final decision of an appellate court creates an opportunity to do so.

## Section 2
The director shall:

1. Administer all state-funded services in the following program areas:

    a. Trial court criminal indigent defense, as provided in chapter 10.101 RCW;

    b. Appellate indigent defense, as provided in this chapter and RCW 10.73.150;

## Section 3

Counsel may be provided at public expense to file or prosecute a collateral attack other than a personal restraint petition or to file or prosecute a second or subsequent collateral attack on the same judgment and sentence, if the court determines that the collateral attack is not barred by RCW 10.73.090 or 10.73.140;

The office of public defense shall:

1. Examine and evaluate barriers to providing postconviction counsel at the request of indigent persons seeking to file and prosecute one, timely motion for collateral attack other than for a personal restraint petition.

2. Identify resources and reforms to barriers;

3. Report findings and recommendations to the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the legislature not later than December 1, 2024.
