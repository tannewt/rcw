5. [Empty]

    a. All meetings of the state building code council, its standing committees, and technical advisory groups shall be open to the public under the open public meetings act, chapter 42.30 RCW. All actions of the state building code council which adopt or amend any code of statewide applicability shall be pursuant to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.

    b. All council decisions relating to the codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 shall require approval by at least a majority of the members of the council.

    c. All decisions to adopt or amend codes of statewide application shall be made prior to December 1 of any year and shall not take effect before the end of the regular legislative session in the next year.

## Section 5
1. The minimum state energy code for new nonresidential buildings shall be the Washington state energy code, 1986 edition, as amended. The state building code council may, by rule adopted pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW and sections 6 through 11 of this act, amend that code's requirements for new nonresidential buildings provided that:

    a. Such amendments increase the energy efficiency of typical newly constructed nonresidential buildings; and

    b. Any new measures, standards, or requirements adopted must be technically feasible, commercially available, and developed to yield the lowest overall cost to the building owner and occupant while meeting the energy reduction goals established under RCW 19.27A.160.

2. In considering amendments to the state energy code for nonresidential buildings, the state building code council shall establish and consult with a technical advisory committee in accordance with section 8 of this act including representatives of appropriate state agencies, local governments, general contractors, building owners and managers, design professionals, utilities, and other interested and affected parties.

3. Decisions to amend the Washington state energy code for new nonresidential buildings shall be made prior to December 15th of any year and shall not take effect before the end of the regular legislative session in the next year. Any disputed provisions within an amendment presented to the legislature shall be approved by the legislature before going into effect. A disputed provision is one which was adopted by the state building code council with less than a two-thirds majority vote. Substantial amendments to the code shall be adopted no more frequently than every three years.

## Section 6
1. The state building code council's process to regularly review updated versions of the building codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 and the state energy code under RCW 19.27A.020 and adoption of statewide and emergency amendments to those codes shall be done in accordance with this section.

2. A petition for statewide or emergency amendment must be submitted in compliance with the format required by the state building code council.

3. The state building code council or the director must remove from consideration any petition for statewide or emergency amendment that:

    a. Does not include all the requested information or does not have sufficient detail to be acted upon as of the deadline established by the building code council for submission of such petitions; or

    b. Requests a rule modification that exceeds the specific delegation of authority provided by the legislature. In performing its duties under this subsection (3)(b), the state building code council may not rely solely on the broad delegation of authority in RCW 19.27.074 or 19.27A.020.

4. Once a petition for statewide amendment that is submitted as part of the review to update the building codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 and the state energy code under RCW 19.27A.020 is accepted as complete, a member of the state building code council must agree to sponsor the amendment in order for the amendment to move forward through the process. A statewide amendment may not be referred to a standing committee or technical advisory group without a councilmember sponsor.

5. Once a councilmember sponsors a proposed statewide amendment, the proposed text of the rule change must be put in written format consistent with the format required by the office of the code reviser for final rules and RCW 34.05.395.

6. The state building code council, its standing committees, and technical advisory committees must have a process of consideration that allows people to understand what textual changes are being proposed and adopted during the consideration process. Modifications of proposed rule text must be in writing, specify the legal authority for the amendment, and be available to all councilmembers and the members of the public before a vote is taken on the modification. Verbally negotiating amendments with text projected or posted on a screen during the meeting immediately prior to a vote does not satisfy this requirement.

7. The state building code council must adopt policies to ensure that the rule-making requirements in chapter 34.05 RCW are abided by during its rule-making process.

## Section 7
1. The state building code council should supplement cost estimate information that is provided in a petition for statewide amendment with independent research if there is a concern that the provided information is not sufficient, it inaccurately represents the actual impacts or costs, or the assertions in the petition are questioned by experts with knowledge of the industry or circumstances.

2. At least two weeks prior to final adoption by the building code council of nonemergency changes to the Washington Administrative Code must post on the agency website and make available for public comment:

    a. The small business economic impact statement as required by chapter 19.85 RCW;

    b. The cost-benefit analysis and supporting information for members to determine the proposed rule is the least burdensome alternative for those required to comply with it and that the probable benefits of the rule are greater than its probable costs as required by chapter 34.05 RCW;

    c. Any independent, third-party analysis performed in accordance with RCW 19.27.074(3)(b);

    d. Any supplemental cost estimate information and industry specific information provided about the proposal; and

    e. Any findings, determinations or recommendations of the state building code council's economic impact work group, consultants, or employees.

3. [Empty]

    a. If a person working in an industry subject to regulation under a proposed rule raises an economic or cost-related protest during consideration of a rule or provides cost or economic analysis that is different than provided by other sources, the members of the state building code council must be made aware of the information.

    b. A person that provides information in (a) of this subsection may request that the state building code council provide a substantive response to raised concerns, including an explanation of incorporated provisions in the proposed rule that address, mitigate, or reduce the expected cost or economic impacts of the proposed rule.

4. The information required in this section should be available for review and vetted by building code council members prior to the final vote adopting any rule modification. The economic and cost information is provided in advance so that the building code council can take action to address, mitigate, or even eliminate identified economic impacts.

## Section 8
1. If the state building code council appoints a technical advisory group to be consulted regarding proposed code changes authorized in chapters 19.27 and 19.27A RCW, the process must be done in accordance with the provisions in this section.

    a. The technical advisory group includes subject matter experts and members representing interested parties. Any person appointed to serve as an expert or representative of a particular interest or group must have the qualifications or characteristics for the specific position.

    b. If a technical advisory group member represents a specific interest or group, any person of that group may petition the building code council to have a person removed from the technical advisory group on grounds that the person does not have the qualifications or characteristics necessary to represent the interest or group. The building code council must remove any technical advisory group member it finds lacks the characteristics and qualifications necessary to fill the position.

2. The state building code council must post the name of each technical advisory group member, the industry or interest group the person represents, and must provide a way to contact each person.

3. Each technical advisory group is subject to the same procedures and process as the state building code council.

4. Each technical advisory group member must have training on the state building code council's procedure and ethics policies.

5. Any application for appointment to serve on a technical advisory group must be approved or denied within 30 days of the council receiving the application.

6. If a petition for a statewide amendment receives less than a majority vote by a technical advisory group, the proposed amendment will be tabled from further consideration. A councilmember may make a motion before the full council to continue consideration of that statewide amendment.

## Section 9
The state building code council must identify the sources of information reviewed and relied upon in the course of adopting changes to the Washington Administrative Code and include such information in the official rule-making file. The state building code must post on its website the materials that the state building code council considered or relied upon during the process. This information must remain publicly available on the website at least until one year after the effective date of any changed rule.

## Section 10
The state building code council must create a distribution list of state agency personnel to be notified by email of the compilation of proposed statewide amendments that constitutes the update of the building and energy codes. The notification must include a copy, or electronic links, or website directions, of the proposed rule, small business economic impact statement, and any additional posted economic analysis related to the proposed changes, and the dates and times for public comment. The distribution list must include the governor's office, the state fire marshal, the capital projects advisory review board, the department of commerce, and other government agencies that will be impacted by the proposed rules. The notification must be sent prior to public hearings on the proposed rules. The state building code council must include individuals that are involved in providing state subsidized housing on the list if the changes impact housing. This contact is to notify the agency that the proposed rule will increase the cost and complexity of building construction and identify when public comment will be taken at a specific date, time, and location. If a proposal changes the design of school buildings, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must be notified.

## Section 11
After the state building code council has filed with the code reviser's office the adopted permanent rule of comprehensive changes to Title 51 RCW of the Washington Administrative Code that occurs every three years, it must submit a report to the legislature identifying provisions that generated conflict, and summarize the different perspectives brought before the state building code council related to the conflict, and how the state building code council addressed that conflict. This report is to be submitted no later than the second Monday in January following the date of filing the permanent rule with the code reviser's office.

## Section 12
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
