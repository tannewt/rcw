<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department must establish an accessible common carrier-based system for online verification of liability insurance or other financial responsibility required under RCW 46.30.020. The verification system must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Be accessible, upon request, only to authorized personnel of the department or any other entities authorized by the department, the courts, law enforcement, and insurers on a limited basis as required to comply with this section, and be interfaced, wherever appropriate, with existing state data systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send requests to insurers for verification of liability insurance or other financial responsibility through web services established by the insurers, the internet, or a similar proprietary or common carrier electronic system as required by the department in rule; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include information that enables the department to make requests for proof of financial responsibility to insurers by using multiple data elements for greater matching accuracy, including NAIC company code, vehicle identification number, policy number, or as described by the department in rule.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must secure system data against unauthorized access, and maintain a historical record of the system data for a period of six to 12 months from the date of any request and response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department must have its verification system respond to each request within a time period established by the department in rule. An insurer's data system must respond to each request within a time period established by the department in rule. The department may offer insurers that write fewer policies than the industry average in Washington state an alternative method for reporting insurance policy data instead of establishing web services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer must cooperate with the department in establishing and maintaining the verification system and provide access to liability insurance or other financial responsibility status information as provided by the department in rule.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may contract with a private service provider or providers who have successfully implemented similar verification systems in other states to assist in establishing and maintaining the verification system. The department must consult with representatives of the insurance industry and private service providers to determine the objectives, details, and deadlines related to the verification system. The department must publish for comment, then issue, a detailed guide of its verification system. The department and its private service provider, if any, must each maintain a contact person for insurers during the establishment, implementation, and operation of the verification system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, every insurer licensed to issue motor vehicle liability insurance in Washington must comply with this section for verification of evidence of liability insurance or other financial responsibility for every vehicle insured by the insurer in Washington as required by department in rule. Every insurer must maintain a historical record of verification system data for a maximum period of six months from the date of any request and response. An insurer may use the services of a third-party vendor for facilitating compliance with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not apply to vehicles insured under a commercial motor vehicle liability insurance policy; however, insurers of such vehicles may participate on a voluntary basis. If participating in the verification system, insurers must provide commercial motor vehicle operators with evidence reflecting that the vehicle is insured under a commercial motor vehicle liability insurance policy including, but not limited to, an insurance identification card consistent with RCW 46.30.030.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer is immune from civil and administrative liability for good faith efforts to comply with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the first 12 months after the effective date of this section, the department may test or pilot the verification system without taking any enforcement action under RCW 46.16A.130(2). By January 1, 2025, the verification system must be installed and fully operational.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;NAIC&quot; means national association of insurance commissioners.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department may verify if a vehicle owner has liability insurance or other financial responsibility required under RCW 46.30.020 using the online motor vehicle insurance verification system established under section 1 of this act:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At the time of original motor vehicle registration or registration renewal for vehicles subject to license fees under RCW 46.17.350(1) (a), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), (j), (k), (n), (o), (p), and (q); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least twice every year at random intervals for any vehicle owner with a previous violation of the requirements described in RCW 46.30.020 through 46.30.040 for a prior period as determined in rule.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the online verification system provides that a vehicle owner does not have liability insurance or other financial responsibility under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the department may impose a penalty in the amount of $250 to be deposited into the driver licensing technology support account created in RCW 46.68.067.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must adopt any rules necessary to implement this section, including the process of imposing and collecting penalty amounts and the minimum number of violations required for random verifications of vehicle owner insurance coverage under subsection (1)(b) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No person may operate a motor vehicle subject to registration under chapter 46.16A RCW in this state unless the person is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy with liability limits of at least the amounts provided in RCW 46.29.090, is self-insured as provided in RCW 46.29.630, is covered by a certificate of deposit in conformance with RCW 46.29.550, or is covered by a liability bond of at least the amounts provided in RCW 46.29.090. Proof of financial responsibility for motor vehicle operation must be provided on the request of a law enforcement officer in the format specified under RCW 46.30.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who drives a motor vehicle that is required to be registered in another state that requires drivers and owners of vehicles in that state to maintain insurance or financial responsibility shall, when requested by a law enforcement officer, provide evidence of financial responsibility or insurance as is required by the laws of the state in which the vehicle is registered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When asked to do so by a law enforcement officer, failure to display proof of financial responsibility for motor vehicle operation as specified under RCW 46.30.030 creates a presumption that the person does not have motor vehicle insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to provide proof of motor vehicle insurance is a traffic infraction and is subject to penalties as set by the supreme court under RCW 46.63.110 or community restitution. Enforcement of the infraction of failing to provide proof of motor vehicle insurance may be accomplished only as a secondary action when a driver of a motor vehicle has been detained for a suspected violation of a separate traffic infraction or an equivalent local ordinance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, when a person uses a portable electronic device to display proof of financial security to a law enforcement officer, the officer may only view the proof of financial security and is otherwise prohibited from viewing any other content on the portable electronic device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a person presents a portable electronic device pursuant to this section, that person assumes all liability for any damage to the portable electronic device.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person cited for a violation of subsection (1) of this section appears in person before the court or a violations bureau and provides written evidence that at the time the person was cited, he or she was in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of subsection (1) of this section, the citation shall be dismissed and the court or violations bureau may assess court administrative costs of $25 at the time of dismissal. In lieu of personal appearance, a person cited for a violation of subsection (1) of this section may, before the date scheduled for the person's appearance before the court or violations bureau, submit by mail to the court or violations bureau written evidence that at the time the person was cited, he or she was in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of subsection (1) of this section, in which case the citation shall be dismissed without cost, except that the court or violations bureau may assess court administrative costs of $25 at the time of dismissal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this chapter shall not govern:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The operation of a motor vehicle registered under RCW 46.18.220 or 46.18.255, governed by RCW 46.16A.170, or registered with the Washington utilities and transportation commission as common or contract carriers; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The operation of a motor-driven cycle as defined in RCW 46.04.332, a moped as defined in RCW 46.04.304, or a wheeled all-terrain vehicle as defined in RCW 46.09.310.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 46.29.490 shall not be deemed to govern all motor vehicle liability policies required by this chapter but only those certified for the purposes stated in chapter 46.29 RCW.</p>
