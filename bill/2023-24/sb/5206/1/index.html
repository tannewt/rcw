<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that it is in the public's interest to preserve the shared state history and athletic achievement of the University of Washington and Washington State University by maintaining these schools in the same athletic conference. Further, the legislature finds that this historic rivalry has existed since 1900 and contributed to a shared history between the two higher education institutions that can not be replicated in separate athletic conferences. In cases such as the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M University, where historic in-state rivals have departed a shared athletic conference, the traditions surrounding that rivalry have fallen by the wayside. Further, the legislature finds that it is in the best interest of the student athletes that the opportunity to play in-state rivals remains a feature across the multitude of sports supported at each institution.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
