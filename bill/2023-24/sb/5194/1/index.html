<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that duties and responsibilities of Washington state's insurance commissioner are similar to other high-level executive branch officials who are currently appointed by the governor. A majority of states appoint rather than elect their insurance commissioners.</p>

<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends by this act to establish a process for the insurance commissioner of this state to be appointed by the governor.</p>
