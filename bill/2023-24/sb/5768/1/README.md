[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5768.pdf)

## Section 1
1. It is the longstanding public policy of this state to promote access to affordable, high quality sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion care, without unnecessary burdens or restrictions on patients or providers. In 1970 Washington was one of the first states to decriminalize abortion before Roe v. Wade; and in 1991 the people of Washington passed Initiative Measure 120, the reproductive privacy act, further protecting access to abortion services. It is the public policy of the state of Washington to continue to protect and advance equal rights to access abortion care that meets each individual's needs, including access to abortion medications.

2. The legislature finds that the continued attack on reproductive freedoms across the country require immediate action to protect the right to abortion access in Washington. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure access to abortion medications for individuals seeking abortion care.

## Section 2
