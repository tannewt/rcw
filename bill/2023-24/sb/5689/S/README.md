This exemption also applies to charges made for the labor and services related to the construction of a qualified infrastructure project or the installation of any equipment or other personal property incorporated into a qualified infrastructure project.

2. [Empty]

    a. In order to obtain an exemption certificate under this section, a taxpayer working on a qualified infrastructure project must submit an application to the department for an exemption certificate. The application must include the information necessary, as required by the department to determine that the taxpayer qualifies for the exemption under this section. The application must also include certification from the owner of the qualified infrastructure project that the taxpayer is associated with the qualified infrastructure project and any other information as required by the department. The department must issue an exemption certificate to qualified taxpayers.

    b. A qualified taxpayer claiming the exemption under this section must present the seller with an exemption certificate in a form and manner prescribed by the department. The seller must retain a copy of the certificate for the seller's files.

    c. The exemption certificate is effective on the date the application is received by the department, which is the date of issuance. Only purchases on or after the date of issuance qualify for the exemption under this section. No tax refunds are authorized for purchases made before the effective date of the exemption.

    d. An exemption certificate expires on the date the project is certified as complete by the qualified infrastructure project owner or December 31, 2029, whichever is first.

A qualified infrastructure project owner within 60 days of the expiration of the exemption certificate under subsection (2)(d) of this section must pay any tax due under this subsection. The department may not assess penalties and interest as provided in chapter 82.32 RCW on the amount due if the amount due is paid within the 60-day period, or any extension thereof. The department may require a qualified infrastructure project owner to periodically submit documentation, as specified by the department, prior to the expiration of the exemption certificate to allow the department to track the total amount of sales and use tax exempted under this section and section 2 of this act.

    a. The owner and the prime contractor and all of its subcontractors regardless of tier have the absolute right to select any qualified and responsible bidder for the award of contracts on a specified project without reference to the existence or nonexistence of any agreements between such bidder and any party to such project labor agreement, and only when such bidder is willing, ready, and able to become a party to, signs a letter of assent, and complies with such agreement or agreements, should it be designated the successful bidder; and

    b. It is understood that this is a self-contained, stand-alone agreement, and that by virtue of having become bound to such agreement or agreements, neither the project contractor nor the subcontractors are obligated to sign any other local, area, or national agreement.
