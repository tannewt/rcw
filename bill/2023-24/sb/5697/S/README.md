## Section 1
For purposes of this chapter:

## Section 2
1. Except as authorized by an exemption described in section 3 of this act and as provided in RCW 59.20.060(2)(c), a landlord may not increase the rent for any tenancy:

    a. During the first 12 months after the tenancy begins; and

    b. At any time after the first year of the tenancy in an amount greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index above the existing rent.

2. Notice under this section must comply with the requirements of RCW 59.20.090(2) and be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040.

3. A landlord terminating a tenancy may not set rent for the next tenancy in an amount greater than the consumer price index above the previous rent.

4. A landlord who charges rent in violation of this section and receives rent in excess of amounts permitted by this section is liable to the tenant for an amount not to exceed $100,000.

5. If a mobile home park or manufactured housing community has been sold or leased, the new owner or leaseholder may not increase rent beyond the amount that the previous landlord would have been permitted to increase the rent under this section or section 3 of this act.

## Section 3
1. A landlord may increase rent in an amount greater than allowed under section 2 of this act only:

    a. By participating in the banked capacity program established under this section; or

    b. As provided in RCW 59.20.060(2)(c).

2. If a landlord participates in the banked capacity program, the landlord may increase the rent above the maximum annual rent increase percentage by an additional amount for each year in which the landlord has banked capacity.

3. [Empty]

    a. The banked capacity program operates as follows:

        i. If a landlord does not increase rent in a 12-month period, the landlord may choose to bank the rent increase capacity for future years. For each preceding year since the last increase in rent, the landlord may increase rent by the total consumer price index increase since the year in which rent was last raised. A landlord who participates in the banked capacity program must provide an annual notice as described in section 2(2) of this act to current and prospective tenants of the total banked capacity and possible future rent increases. Notice must be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040. A landlord forfeits the landlord's right to claim banked rent increase capacity if the landlord fails to properly notify the landlord's tenants;

        ii. If a tenant is evicted or if a tenant leaves after an eviction has been initiated, for any new rental agreement entered into within 12 months of the termination of the prior tenancy, the amount of rent that a landlord may charge a new tenant is limited to the previous tenant's rent plus any banked capacity that was accrued under the prior tenancy;

        iii. If a tenant moves out voluntarily, the amount of rent that a landlord may charge a new tenant is not limited by the maximum annual rent increase percentage or any banked capacity, and the landlord may reset the rent to market rate. However, if the landlord increases the rent for the new tenant beyond the previous tenant's rent, any banked capacity is lost. If a landlord chooses not to increase the rent and charges a new tenant the same amount of rent that the landlord charged the previous tenant, the landlord may retain any banked capacity that was accrued under the prior tenancy; and

        iv. If a new owner buys a property and takes over a lease, the new owner may not increase rent for existing tenants beyond the amount that the previous landlord would have been allowed to increase rent. The former landlord's banked capacity may be transferred as part of a property sale.

    b. If a landlord participates in the banked capacity program the landlord must maintain all records relating to the banked capacity program for a three-year period, make these records available for public inspection, and furnish these records to the utilities and transportation commission upon the utilities and transportation commission's request.

4. [Empty]

    a. Upon its own motion, or upon complaint by a tenant or third party, the utilities and transportation commission shall carry out duties imposed upon it by law to investigate the records, accounts, practices, and activities of the landlord.

    b. If the utilities and transportation commission finds any violation of this section, any costs incurred by the commission in its duties to review and investigate filings by the landlord shall be paid by the landlord.

5. The utilities and transportation commission may adopt any rules in accordance with chapter 80.01 RCW necessary to implement this section.

## Section 4
The utilities and transportation commission shall:

1. Exercise all the powers and perform all the duties prescribed by this title and by Title 81 RCW, or by any other law.

2. Regulate in the public interest, as provided by the public service laws, all persons engaging in the transportation of persons or property within this state for compensation.

3. Regulate in the public interest, as provided by the public service laws, the rates, services, facilities, and practices of all persons engaging within this state in the business of supplying any utility service or commodity to the public for compensation.

Regulate in the public interest, as provided by the public service laws, the rates and services of all persons engaging within this state in the business of acting as a landlord, as defined in RCW 59.020.030, for mobile home parks, manufactured housing communities, or manufactured/mobile home communities.

5. Make rules and regulations necessary to carry out its other powers and duties.

A listing of the utilities, services, and facilities which will be available to the tenant during the tenancy and the nature of the fees, if any, to be charged together with a statement that, in the event any utilities are changed to be charged independent of the rent during the term of the rental agreement, the landlord agrees to decrease the amount of the rent charged proportionately;

    n. A statement of the expiration date of any conditional use, temporary use, or other land use permit subject to a fixed expiration date that is necessary for the continued use of the land as a mobile home park; and

    o. A written statement containing accurate historical information regarding the past five years' rental amount charged for the lot or space.

2. Any rental agreement executed between the landlord and tenant shall not contain any provision:

    b. Which authorizes the towing or impounding of a vehicle except upon notice to the owner thereof or the tenant whose guest is the owner of the vehicle;

    c. Which allows the landlord to alter the due date for rent payment or increase the rent: (i) During the term of the rental agreement if the term is less than two years, or (ii) more frequently than annually if the initial term is for two years or more: PROVIDED, That a rental agreement may include an escalation clause for a pro rata share of any increase in the mobile home park's real property taxes or utility assessments or charges, over the base taxes or utility assessments or charges of the year in which the rental agreement took effect, if the clause also provides for a pro rata reduction in rent or other charges in the event of a reduction in real property taxes or utility assessments or charges, below the base year: PROVIDED FURTHER, That a rental agreement for a term exceeding two years may provide for annual increases in rent in specified amounts or by a formula specified in such agreement. Any rent increase authorized under this subsection may not exceed the value of the previous year's rent plus the consumer price index for the year in which the agreement was signed.
