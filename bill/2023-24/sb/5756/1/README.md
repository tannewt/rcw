[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5756.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds:

    a. Gasoline and diesel are essential to daily life for most Washington residents, with gasoline and diesel helping to take most working people to and from their jobs, take most students to and from school, and keep Washington's economy moving, helping transport freight to and from markets and ports and transport food from farm to table.

    b. That while the state budget is expected to have a record surplus, Washingtonians are facing record high inflation in the cost of goods and services, and their own household budgets have been affected by high gas prices that have continued to increase over time. It also finds that the cost of gasoline and diesel consumes more financial resources from lower-income households, which can least afford significant price inflation, and from rural households, which incur larger costs for essential travel than residents of more populated regions of the state.

2. The legislature intends to make gasoline and diesel more affordable for the families, job creators, students, and residents of Washington by suspending the motor vehicle fuel tax, using a portion of the historic budget surplus, and offering this significant, direct tax relief through December 31, 2023.

9. Taxes are imposed when:

    a. Fuel is removed in this state from a terminal if the fuel is removed at the rack unless the removal is by a licensed supplier or distributor for direct delivery to a destination outside of the state, or the removal is by a fuel supplier for direct delivery to an international fuel tax agreement licensee under RCW 82.38.320;

    b. Fuel is removed in this state from a refinery if either of the following applies:

        i. The removal is by bulk transfer and the refiner or the owner of the fuel immediately before the removal is not a licensed supplier; or

        ii. The removal is at the refinery rack unless the removal is to a licensed supplier or distributor for direct delivery to a destination outside of the state, or the removal is to a licensed supplier for direct delivery to an international fuel tax agreement licensee under RCW 82.38.320;

    c. Fuel enters into this state for sale, consumption, use, or storage, unless the fuel enters this state for direct delivery to an international fuel tax agreement licensee under RCW 82.38.320, if either of the following applies:
