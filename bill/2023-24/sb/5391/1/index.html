<ol>
<li>
<p>To preserve quality of life and well-being for Washingtonians and increase the carbon competitiveness of Washington businesses, documented greenhouse gas reductions are required, including embodied carbon reductions in structural products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing embodied carbon necessitates a focus beyond just procurement. Building clean in the built environment requires the implementation of multiple strategies including: Modeling the lifetime carbon emissions of the structure, programming and budgeting for a long service life, increasing the number of available product-specific environmental product declarations to facilitate embodied carbon measurement, and reporting the embodied carbon intensities and the product quantities of completed projects to inform meaningful reduction targets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the significant accomplishments of Washington state project teams including designers, engineers, construction contractors, and product manufacturers to build award winning sustainable projects regionally and nationally. The legislature also recognizes the importance of incorporating professional industry insights and input to inform the building material selection process, resolve constructability issues, and realize significant and measurable embodied carbon emission reductions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through collaboration with all project team members early in the design process and considering all phases of the project's service life, key decisions can be made regarding design, constructability, product innovation, and optimization to identify innovative and synergistic strategies that reduce both energy use and overall carbon emissions over the service life of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide design and construction teams the ability to select the product, or combination of products, which satisfies program, cost, schedule, product availability, as well as carbon reduction targets, the project's embodied carbon baseline and reduction targets should measure and compare the impact of all eligible products in aggregate, and not in isolation. Measuring impacts in aggregate enables the contractor to offset the higher impact of an unavoidable eligible product by strategically selecting specific eligible products with a lower impact and provides needed flexibility in procurement and construction decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the need to maintain an adequate quantity and resilient supply chain for lower carbon building products to support a robust economy balanced with environmental stewardship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, Washington has a unique combination of natural, clean energy, manufacturing, and knowledge assets that have realized significant embodied carbon reductions in completed public sector projects.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>To provide consistency in targeting and measuring embodied carbon reductions and in reporting data, the project-specific baseline, the project-specific reduction percentage, and the embodied carbon intensity must be calculated and reported pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to bidding of eligible products, the designer of record or the project's life-cycle assessment consultant under the designer of record's direction must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Calculate an estimated embodied carbon emissions for the project's eligible products and include this calculation in the construction specifications used for bidding of the eligible products.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The project's estimated embodied carbon emissions must be expressed in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalence and is equal to the sum of: Each eligible product quantity multiplied by the corresponding embodied emissions intensity factor found in the most recently published industry-average environmental product declaration, if available, as published by the following organizations:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Wood products: American wood council (AWC);</p>
<p>(B) Steel sections, and steel tendons: American institute of steel construction (AISC);</p>
<p>(C) Steel reinforcing: Concrete reinforcing steel institute (CRSI);</p>
<p>(D) Ready-mixed concrete: National ready-mixed concrete association (NRMCA, Pacific Northwest regional baseline data);</p>
<pre><code>    ii. For concrete, quantities must be grouped by the mixes' individual strength class and type of weight, such as lightweight concrete or conventional concrete. The applicable strength class baseline must be determined as the minimum specified design strength as documented by cylinder testing, maturity testing, or both. The embodied greenhouse gases of mixes may be reduced through the use of material and mix design innovations.

    iii. Eligible products without published regional or national industry-average environmental product declarations, such as ready-mixed concrete mixes exceeding 8,000 pounds per square inch, must use available data from a mix-specific benchmark calculated from verifiable data from a life-cycle analysis practitioner.

    iv. The designer of record's estimated embodied carbon emissions calculation must be based on the estimated quantity of eligible products in the bid documents. For building projects, eligible products used on site must be excluded from the quantity estimate.

b. Calculate an estimated embodied carbon intensity, which is the ratio of the total carbon dioxide equivalents in kilograms for the quantities of all eligible products divided by the square meters of project area.
