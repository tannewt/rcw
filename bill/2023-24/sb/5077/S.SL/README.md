"Security interest" includes any interest of a consignor and a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, a payment intangible, or a promissory note in a transaction that is subject to Article 9A of this title. "Security interest" does not include the special property interest of a buyer of goods on identification of those goods to a contract for sale under RCW 62A.2-401, but a buyer may also acquire a "security interest" by complying with Article 9A of this title.

The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer under RCW 62A.2-401 is limited in effect to a reservation of a "security interest." Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a "security interest" is determined pursuant to RCW 62A.1-203.

3. By accepting delivery under a preexisting contract for purchase; or

4. In return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.

A claim or right arising out of an alleged breach may be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in a signed record.

## Section 201
1. Unless the context otherwise requires, and except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, this Article applies to transactions in goods and, in the case of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided in subsection (2) of this section.

2. In a hybrid transaction:

    a. If the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions of this Article which relate primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a whole do not apply.

    b. If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this Article applies to the transaction but does not preclude application in appropriate circumstances of other law to aspects of the transaction which do not relate to the sale of goods.

3. This Article does not:

    a. Apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an unconditional contract to sell or present sale, operates only to create a security interest; or

    b. Impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers, or other specified classes of buyers.

## Section 202
1. In this Article unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (RCW 62A.2-401). A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.

2. Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming" or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.

3. "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.

4. "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the canceling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

5. "Hybrid transaction" means a single transaction involving a sale of goods and:

    a. The provision of services;

    b. A lease of other goods; or

    c. A sale, lease, or license of property other than goods.

## Section 203
1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is a record sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by the party's authorized agent or broker. A record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in the record.

2. Between merchants if within a reasonable time a record in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) of this section against the party unless  notice in a record of objection to its contents is given within 10 days after it is received.

3. A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) of this section but which is valid in other respects is enforceable:

    a. If the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or

    b. If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his or her pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or

    c. With respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (RCW 62A.2-606).

## Section 204
Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a record intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented:

    a. By course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade (RCW 62A.1-303); and

    b. By evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the record to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

## Section 205
The affixing of a seal to a record evidencing a contract for sale or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the record a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such contract or offer.

## Section 206
An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed record which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

## Section 207
1. An agreement modifying a contract within this Article needs no consideration to be binding.

2. A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing or other signed record cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.

3. The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this Article (RCW 62A.2-201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.

4. Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.

5. A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

## Section 301
1. This Article applies to any transaction, regardless of form, that creates a lease and, in the case of a hybrid lease, it applies to the extent provided in subsection (2) of this section.

2. In a hybrid lease:

    a. If the lease-of-goods aspects do not predominate:

        i. Only the provisions of this Article which relate primarily to the lease-of-goods aspects of the transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a whole do not apply;

        ii. RCW 62A.2A-209 applies if the lease is a finance lease; and

        iii. RCW 62A.2A-407 applies to the promises of the lessee in a finance lease to the extent the promises are consideration for the right to possession and use of the leased goods; and

    b. If the lease-of-goods aspects predominate, this Article applies to the transaction, but does not preclude application in appropriate circumstances of other law to aspects of the lease which do not relate to the lease of goods.

## Section 302
1. In this Article unless the context otherwise requires:

    a. "Buyer in ordinary course of business" means a person who in good faith and without knowledge that the sale to him or her is in violation of the ownership rights or security interest or leasehold interest of a third party in the goods buys in ordinary course from a person in the business of selling goods of that kind but does not include a pawnbroker.

    f. "Fault" means wrongful act, omission, breach, or default.

    g. "Finance lease" means a lease with respect to which:

        iii. Only in the case of a consumer lease, either:

(C) The lessee, before signing the lease contract, receives an accurate and complete statement designating the promises and warranties, and any disclaimers of warranties, limitations or modifications of remedies, or liquidated damages, including those of a third party, such as the manufacturer of the goods, provided to the lessor by the person supplying the goods in connection with or as part of the contract by which the lessor acquired the goods or the right to possession and use of the goods.

        i. "Installment lease contract" means a lease contract that authorizes or requires the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the lease contract contains a clause "each delivery is a separate lease" or its equivalent.

    j. "Lease" means a transfer of the right to possession and use of goods for a term in return for consideration, but a sale, including a sale on approval or a sale or return, or retention or creation of a security interest is not a lease. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term includes a sublease.

    k. "Lease agreement" means the bargain, with respect to the lease, of the lessor and the lessee in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance as provided in this Article.

Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a record intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented:

1. By course of dealing or usage of trade or by course of performance; and

2. By evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the record to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

## Section 306
The affixing of a seal to a record evidencing a lease contract or an offer to enter into a lease contract does not render the record a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to the lease contract or offer.

## Section 307
An offer by a merchant to lease goods to or from another person in a signed record that by its terms gives assurance it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or, if no time is stated, for a reasonable time, but in no event may the period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

## Section 308
1. An agreement modifying a lease contract needs no consideration to be binding.

2. A signed lease agreement that excludes modification or rescission except by a signed record may not be otherwise modified or rescinded, but, except as between merchants, such a requirement on a form supplied by a merchant must be separately signed by the other party.

3. Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, it may operate as a waiver.

4. A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of a lease contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

## Section 401
    a. Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:

1. Is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;

2. Is payable on demand or at a definite time; and

3. Does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral,  (iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor, (iv) a term that specifies the law that governs the promise or order, or (v) an undertaking to resolve in a specified forum a dispute concerning the promise or order.

    b. "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.

    c. An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except subsection (a)(1), and otherwise falls within the definition of "check" in subsection (f) is a negotiable instrument and a check.

    d. A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this Article.

    e. An instrument is a "note" if it is a promise and is a "draft" if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the definition of both "note" and "draft," a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.

    f. "Check" means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank, or (ii) a cashier's check or teller's check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as "money order."

    g. "Cashier's check" means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.

    h. "Teller's check" means a draft drawn by a bank (i) on another bank, or (ii) payable at or through a bank.

        i. "Traveler's check" means an instrument that (i) is payable on demand, (ii) is drawn on or payable at or through a bank, (iii) is designated by the term "traveler's check" or by a substantially similar term, and (iv) requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.

    j. "Certificate of deposit" means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A certificate of deposit is a note of the bank.

## Section 402
    a. "Issue" means :

1. The first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer, whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person; or

2. If agreed by the payee, the first transmission by the drawer to the payee of an image of an item and information derived from the item that enables the depositary bank to collect the item by transferring or presenting under federal law an electronic check.

    b. An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete instrument that is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer, but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.

    c. "Issuer" applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.

## Section 403
A person is not liable on an instrument unless (a) the person signed the instrument, or (b) the person is represented by an agent or representative who signed the instrument and the signature is binding on the represented person under RCW 62A.3‑402.

## Section 404
    a. A person entitled to enforce an instrument, with or without consideration, may discharge the obligation of a party to pay the instrument (i) by an intentional voluntary act, such as surrender of the instrument to the party, destruction, mutilation, or cancellation of the instrument, cancellation or striking out of the party's signature, or the addition of words to the instrument indicating discharge, or (ii) by agreeing not to sue or otherwise renouncing rights against the party by a signed writing. The obligation of a party to pay a check is not discharged solely by destruction of the check in connection with a process in which information is extracted from the check and an image of the check is made and, subsequently, the information and image are transmitted for payment.

    b. Cancellation or striking out of an indorsement pursuant to subsection (a) does not affect the status and rights of a party derived from the indorsement.

## Section 501
    a. In this Article:

1. "Payment order" means an instruction of a sender to a receiving bank, transmitted orally or in a record, to pay, or to cause another bank to pay, a fixed or determinable amount of money to a beneficiary if:

        i. The instruction does not state a condition to payment to the beneficiary other than time of payment;

        ii. The receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of, or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender; and

        iii. The instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system for transmittal to the receiving bank.

2. "Beneficiary" means the person to be paid by the beneficiary's bank.

3. "Beneficiary's bank" means the bank identified in a payment order in which an account of the beneficiary is to be credited pursuant to the order or which otherwise is to make payment to the beneficiary if the order does not provide for payment to an account.

4. "Receiving bank" means the bank to which the sender's instruction is addressed.

5. "Sender" means the person giving the instruction to the receiving bank.

    b. If an instruction complying with subsection (a)(1) of this section is to make more than one payment to a beneficiary, the instruction is a separate payment order with respect to each payment.

    c. A payment order is issued when it is sent to the receiving bank.

## Section 502
"Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (1) verifying that a payment order or communication amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer, or (2) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an obligation on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words , numbers, symbols, sounds, biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to be sent from a known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by itself a security procedure.

## Section 503
    a. A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.

    b. If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i) the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank's obligations under the security procedure and any  agreement or instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a an agreement with the customer, evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted.

    c. Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in a record to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name, and accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank's obligations under the security procedure chosen by the customer.

    d. The term "sender" in this Article includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (a) of this section, or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection (b) of this section.

    e. This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.

    f. Except as provided in this section and RCW 62A.4A‑203(a)(1), rights and obligations arising under this section or RCW 62A.4A‑203 may not be varied by agreement.

## Section 504
    a. If an accepted payment order is not, under RCW 62A.4A-202(a), an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order of the customer pursuant to RCW 62A.4A‑202(b), the following rules apply.

1. By express  agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.

2. The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person (i) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure, or (ii) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault. Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like.

    b. This section applies to amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.

## Section 505
    a. Subject to subsection (b) of this section, if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.

    b. If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply:

1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.

2. If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.

    c. If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) of this section is accepted, (ii) the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (b)(1) of this section, the following rules apply:

1. If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.

2. If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a record stating the information to which the notice relates.

    d. In a case governed by subsection (b)(1) of this section, if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as follows:

1. If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (c) of this section, the originator has the right to recover.

2. If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank has the right to recover.

## Section 506
    a. This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number.

1. The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.

2. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.

    b. This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons.

1. If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.

2. If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (b)(1) of this section, as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a record stating the information to which the notice relates.

3. Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.

4. If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in RCW 62A.4A‑302(a)(1).

## Section 507
    a. A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally or in a record. A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.

    b. This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to RCW 62A.4A‑211(d) or the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly.

    c. If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.

    d. Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order.

## Section 508
    a. A communication of the sender of a payment order canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally or in a record. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.

    b. Subject to subsection (a) of this section, a communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order.

    c. After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank.

1. With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.

2. With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order (i) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender, (ii) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator, or (iii) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator. If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.

    d. An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.

    e. A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time.

    f. Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.

    g. A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.

    h. A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (c)(2) of this section.

## Section 509
    a. If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of RCW 62A.4A‑302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, additional damages are not recoverable.

    b. If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of RCW 62A.4A‑302 results in (i) noncompletion of the funds transfer, (ii) failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or (iii) issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (a) of this section, resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, additional damages are not recoverable.

    c. In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express  agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced by a record.

    d. If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express  agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced by a record, but are not otherwise recoverable.

    e. Reasonable attorneys' fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (a) or (b) of this section is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a claim is made for breach of an agreement under subsection (d) of this section and the agreement does not provide for damages, reasonable attorneys' fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (d) of this section is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.

    f. Except as stated in this section, the liability of a receiving bank under subsections (a) and (b) of this section may not be varied by agreement.

## Section 601
A letter of credit, confirmation, advice, transfer, amendment, or cancellation may be issued in any form that is a signed record ‑.

## Section 602
    a. The liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in the form of a record signed  by the affected parties  or by a provision in the person's letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking. The jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.

    b. Unless subsection (a) of this section applies, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the person is located. The person is considered to be located at the address indicated in the person's undertaking. If more than one address is indicated, the person is considered to be located at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued.

    c. For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but not enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered separate juridical entities and a bank is considered to be located at the place where its relevant branch is considered to be located under this subsection.

    d. A branch of a bank is considered to be located at the address indicated in the branch's undertaking. If more than one address is indicated, the branch is considered to be located at the address from which the undertaking was issued.

    e. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking is expressly made subject. If (i) this Article would govern the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, (ii) the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice, and (iii) there is conflict between this Article and those rules as applied to that undertaking, those rules govern except to the extent of any conflict with the nonvariable provisions specified in RCW 62A.5‑103(c).

    f. If there is conflict between this Article and Article 3, 4, 4A, or 9A, this Article governs.

    g. The forum for settling disputes arising out of an undertaking within this Article may be chosen in the manner and with the binding effect that governing law may be chosen in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.

## Section 702
    a. A person has control of an electronic document of title if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the electronic document reliably establishes that person as the person to which the electronic document was issued or transferred.

    b. A system satisfies subsection (a) of this section, and a person has control of an electronic document of title, if the document is created, stored, and transferred in  a manner that:

1. A single authoritative copy of the document exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection, unalterable;

2. The authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:

(A) The person to which the document was issued; or

(B) If the authoritative copy indicates that the document has been transferred, the person to which the document was most recently transferred;

3. The authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person asserting control or its designated custodian;

4. Copies or amendments that add or change an identified transferee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control;

1. The authoritative electronic copy, a record attached to or logically associated with the authoritative electronic copy, or a system in which the authoritative electronic copy is recorded limits the use of the document of title or has a protocol that is programmed to cause a change, including a transfer or loss of control; or

2. The power is shared with another person.

    e. A power of a person is not shared with another person under subsection (d)(2) of this section and the person's power is not exclusive if:

1. The person can exercise the power only if the power also is exercised by the other person; and

2. The other person:

(A) Can exercise the power without exercise of the power by the person; or

(B) Is the transferor to the person of an interest in the document of title.

    f. If a person has the powers specified in subsection (c)(3)(A) and (B) of this section, the powers are presumed to be exclusive.

A purchaser has control of an authoritative electronic copy of a record evidencing chattel paper if a system employed for evidencing the assignment of interests in the chattel paper reliably establishes the purchaser as the person to which the authoritative electronic copy was assigned.

    b. Single authoritative copy. A system satisfies subsection (a) of this section if the record or records evidencing the chattel paper are created, stored, and assigned in a manner that:

1. A single authoritative copy of the record or records exists which is unique, identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection, unalterable;

2. The authoritative copy identifies the purchaser as the assignee of the record or records;

3. The authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the purchaser or its designated custodian;

1. Enables the purchaser readily to identify each electronic copy as either an authoritative copy or a nonauthoritative copy;

2. Enables the purchaser readily to identify itself in any way, including by name, identifying number, cryptographic key, office, or account number, as the assignee of the authoritative electronic copy; and

3. Gives the purchaser exclusive power, subject to subsection (d) of this section, to:

Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note.

    e.  Subsection (d) of this section does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under RCW 62A.9A-610 or an acceptance of collateral under RCW 62A.9A-620.

This section applies to the acquisition and purchase of rights in a controllable account or controllable payment intangible, including the rights and benefits under subsections (c), (d), (e), (g), and (h) of this section of a purchaser and qualifying purchaser, in the same manner this section applies to a controllable electronic record.

    b. Control of controllable account and controllable payment intangible. To determine whether a purchaser of a controllable account or a controllable payment intangible is a qualifying purchaser, the purchaser obtains control of the account or payment intangible if it obtains control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the account or payment intangible.

    c. Applicability of other law to acquisition of rights. Except as provided in this section, law other than this Article determines whether a person acquires a right in a controllable electronic record and the right the person acquires.

    d. Shelter principle and purchase of limited interest. A purchaser of a controllable electronic record acquires all rights in the controllable electronic record that the transferor had or had power to transfer, except that a purchaser of a limited interest in a controllable electronic record acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased.

    e. Rights of qualifying purchaser. A qualifying purchaser acquires its rights in the controllable electronic record free of a claim of a property right in the controllable electronic record.

    f. Limitation of rights of qualifying purchaser in other property. Except as provided in subsections (a) and (e) of this section for a controllable account and a controllable payment intangible or law other than this Article, a qualifying purchaser takes a right to payment, right to performance, or other interest in property evidenced by the controllable electronic record subject to a claim of a property right in the right to payment, right to performance, or other interest in property.

    g. No-action protection for qualifying purchaser. An action may not be asserted against a qualifying purchaser based on both a purchase by the qualifying purchaser of a controllable electronic record and a claim of a property right in another controllable electronic record, whether the action is framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory.

    h. Filing not notice. Filing of a financing statement under Article 9A of this title is not notice of a claim of a property right in a controllable electronic record.

## Section 1005
    a. General rule: Control of controllable electronic record. A person has control of a controllable electronic record if the electronic record, a record attached to or logically associated with the electronic record, or a system in which the electronic record is recorded:

1. Gives the person:

(A) Power to avail itself of substantially all the benefit from the electronic record; and

(B) Exclusive power, subject to subsection (b) of this section, to:

        i. Prevent others from availing themselves of substantially all the benefit from the electronic record; and

        ii. Transfer control of the electronic record to another person or cause another person to obtain control of another controllable electronic record as a result of the transfer of the electronic record; and

2. Enables the person readily to identify itself in any way, including by name, identifying number, cryptographic key, office, or account number, as having the powers specified in (1) of this subsection.

    b. Meaning of exclusive. Subject to subsection (c) of this section, a power is exclusive under subsection (a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of this section even if:

1. The controllable electronic record, a record attached to or logically associated with the electronic record, or a system in which the electronic record is recorded limits the use of the electronic record or has a protocol programmed to cause a change, including a transfer or loss of control or a modification of benefits afforded by the electronic record; or

2. The power is shared with another person.

    c. When power not shared with another person. A power of a person is not shared with another person under subsection (b)(2) of this section and the person's power is not exclusive if:

1. The person can exercise the power only if the power also is exercised by the other person; and

2. The other person:

(A) Can exercise the power without exercise of the power by the person; or

(B) Is the transferor to the person of an interest in the controllable electronic record or a controllable account or controllable payment intangible evidenced by the controllable electronic record.

    d. Presumption of exclusivity of certain powers. If a person has the powers specified in subsection (a)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of this section, the powers are presumed to be exclusive.

    e. Control through another person.

2. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a person that formerly had control of the controllable electronic record.

    b. Content and effect of notification. Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the account debtor may not discharge its obligation by paying a person that formerly had control of the controllable electronic record if the account debtor receives a notification that:

1. Is signed by a person that formerly had control or the person to which control was transferred;

2. Reasonably identifies the controllable account or controllable payment intangible;

3. Notifies the account debtor that control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the controllable account or controllable payment intangible was transferred;

4. Identifies the transferee, in any reasonable way, including by name, identifying number, cryptographic key, office, or account number; and

5. Provides a commercially reasonable method by which the account debtor is to pay the transferee.

    c. Discharge following effective notification.

    d. When notification ineffective. Subject to subsection (h) of this section, notification is ineffective under subsection (b) of this section:

1. Unless, before the notification is sent, the account debtor and the person that, at that time, had control of the controllable electronic record that evidences the controllable account or controllable payment intangible agree in a signed record to a commercially reasonable method by which a person may furnish reasonable proof that control has been transferred;

2. To the extent an agreement between the account debtor and seller of a payment intangible limits the account debtor's duty to pay a person other than the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this Article; or

3. At the option of the account debtor, if the notification notifies the account debtor to:

    f. What constitutes reasonable proof. A person furnishes reasonable proof under subsection (e) of this section that control has been transferred if the person demonstrates, using the method in the agreement referred to in subsection (d)(1) of this section, that the transferee has the power to:

## Section 1007
    a. Governing law: General rule. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the local law of a controllable electronic record's jurisdiction governs a matter covered by this Article.

    b. Governing law: Section 1006 of this act. For a controllable electronic record that evidences a controllable account or controllable payment intangible, the local law of the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction governs a matter covered by section 1006 of this act unless an effective agreement determines that the local law of another jurisdiction governs.

    c. Controllable electronic record's jurisdiction. The following rules determine a controllable electronic record's jurisdiction under this section:

1. If the controllable electronic record, or a record attached to or logically associated with the controllable electronic record and readily available for review, expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction for purposes of this Article or this title, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.

2. If (1) of this subsection does not apply and the rules of the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded are readily available for review and expressly provide that a particular jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction for purposes of this Article or this title, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.

3. If (1) and (2) of this subsection do not apply and the controllable electronic record, or a record attached to or logically associated with the controllable electronic record and readily available for review, expressly provides that the controllable electronic record is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.

4. If (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection do not apply and the rules of the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded are readily available for review and expressly provide that the controllable electronic record or the system is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.

5. If (1) through (4) of this subsection do not apply, the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction is the District of Columbia.

    d. Applicability of Article 12. If subsection (c)(5) of this section applies and this Article 12 is not in effect in the District of Columbia without material modification, the governing law for a matter covered by this Article is the law of the District of Columbia as though Article 12 were in effect in the District of Columbia without material modification. In this subsection, "Article 12" means Article 12 of Uniform Commercial Code Amendments (2022).

    e. Relation of matter or transaction to controllable electronic record's jurisdiction not necessary. To the extent subsections (a) and (b) of this section provide that the local law of the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction governs a matter covered by this Article, that law governs even if the matter or a transaction to which the matter relates does not bear any relation to the controllable electronic record's jurisdiction.

    f. Rights of purchasers determined at time of purchase. The rights acquired under section 1004 of this act by a purchaser or qualifying purchaser are governed by the law applicable under this section at the time of purchase.

## Section 1104
    a. Preeffective-date transaction, lien, or interest. Except as provided in this part, Article 9A of this title as amended by this act and Article 12 apply to a transaction, lien, or other interest in property, even if the transaction, lien, or interest was entered into, created, or acquired before the effective date of this section.

    b. Continuing validity. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section and sections 1005 through 1109 of this act:

1. A transaction, lien, or interest in property that was validly entered into, created, or transferred before the effective date of this section and was not governed by this title, but would be subject to Article 9A of this title as amended by this act or Article 12 if it had been entered into, created, or transferred on or after the effective date of this section, including the rights, duties, and interests flowing from the transaction, lien, or interest, remains valid on and after the effective date of this section; and

## Section 1105
    a. Continuing perfection: Perfection requirements satisfied. A security interest that is enforceable and perfected immediately before the effective date of this section is a perfected security interest under this act if, on the effective date of this section, the requirements for enforceability and perfection under this act are satisfied without further action.

    b. Continuing perfection: Enforceability or perfection requirements not satisfied. If a security interest is enforceable and perfected immediately before the effective date of this section, but the requirements for enforceability or perfection under this act are not satisfied on the effective date of this section, the security interest:

1. Is a perfected security interest until the earlier of the time perfection would have ceased under the law in effect immediately before the effective date of this section or the adjustment date;

2. Remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest satisfies the requirements for enforceability under RCW 62A.9A-203, as amended by this act, before the adjustment date; and

3. Remains perfected thereafter only if the requirements for perfection under this act are satisfied before the time specified in (1) of this subsection.

## Section 1106
A security interest that is enforceable immediately before the effective date of this section but is unperfected at that time:

    a. Remains an enforceable security interest until the adjustment date;

    b. Remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest becomes enforceable under RCW 62A.9A-203, as amended by this act, on the effective date of this section or before the adjustment date; and

    c. Becomes perfected:

1. Without further action, on the effective date of this section if the requirements for perfection under this act are satisfied before or at that time; or

2. When the requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied after that time.

## Section 1107
    a. Preeffective-date action; attachment and perfection before adjustment date. If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before the effective date of this section and the action would have resulted in perfection of the security interest had the security interest become enforceable before the effective date of this section, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this act before the adjustment date. An attached security interest becomes unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this act before the adjustment date.

    b. Preeffective-date filing. The filing of a financing statement before the effective date of this section is effective to perfect a security interest on the effective date of this section to the extent the filing would satisfy the requirements for perfection under this act.

    c. Preeffective-date enforceability action. The taking of an action before the effective date of this section is sufficient for the enforceability of a security interest on the effective date of this section if the action would satisfy the requirements for enforceability under this act.

    c. Determination of certain priorities on adjustment date. When the priority rules of Article 9A of this title as amended by this act do not apply, to the extent the priorities determined by this act modify the priorities established before the effective date of this section, the priorities of claims to Article 12 property established before the effective date of this section cease to apply on the adjustment date.
