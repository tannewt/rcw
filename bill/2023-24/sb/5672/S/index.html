<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Washington auto theft prevention authority account was created in 2007 to provide dedicated funding from traffic infraction collections to support programs designed to prevent and prosecute motor vehicle theft. The legislature finds that over the years, funding from the account has been diverted to other nonauto theft uses such as department of corrections' operations and youth gang prevention programs. The legislature further finds that revenues from traffic infractions have decreased as more drivers access diversion and deferral programs designed to assist people with retaining their licenses. Fund diversions and decreasing traffic infraction revenue threaten the viability of motor vehicle theft prevention programs at a time when the number of motor vehicle thefts have increased 88 percent between the year 2021 and 2022. In order to provide more secure funding to combat and prevent motor vehicle theft, the legislature intends each fiscal year to deposit into the Washington auto theft prevention authority account $7,000,000 of insurance premium tax collections that would otherwise be deposited to the general fund and to have this deposit grow by inflation. The legislature further intends for moneys collected from the traffic infraction surcharge in RCW 46.63.110(7)(b) to be deposited into the state general fund.</p>
