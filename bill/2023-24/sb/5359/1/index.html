</li>
<li>
<p>The state treasurer shall not issue or redeem any check, warrant, or voucher that will result in a state general fund or related funds expenditure for any fiscal year in excess of the state expenditure limit established under this chapter.

</li>
<li>
<p>The state expenditure limit for any fiscal year shall be the previous fiscal year's state expenditure limit increased by a percentage rate that equals the annual spending cap.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the cost of any state program or function is shifted from the state general fund or related funds to another source of funding, or if moneys are transferred from the state general fund or related funds to another fund or account, the legislature must lower the state expenditure limit to reflect the shift. For the purposes of this section, a transfer of money from the state general fund or related funds to another fund or account includes any state legislative action taken that has the effect of reducing revenues from a particular source, where such revenues would otherwise be deposited into the state general fund or related funds, while increasing the revenues from that particular source to another state or local government account. This subsection does not apply to: (a) The dedication or use of lottery revenues under RCW 67.70.240(1)(c), in support of education or education expenditures; (b) a transfer of moneys to, or an expenditure from, the budget stabilization account; or (c) a transfer of moneys to, or an expenditure from, the connecting Washington account established in RCW 46.68.395.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the cost of any state program or function and the ongoing revenue necessary to fund the program or function are shifted to the state general fund or related funds on or after January 1, 2024, the state budget outlook work group must increase the state expenditure limit to reflect the shift unless the shifted revenue had previously been shifted from the general fund or related funds.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in this chapter, the levy for a taxing district in any year must be set so that the regular property taxes payable in the following year do not exceed the limit factor multiplied by the amount of regular property taxes lawfully levied for such district in the highest of the three most recent years in which such taxes were levied for such district, excluding any increase due to (e) of this subsection, unless the highest levy was the statutory maximum rate amount, plus an additional dollar amount calculated by multiplying the regular property tax levy rate of that district for the preceding year by the increase in assessed value in that district resulting from:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>New construction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases in assessed value due to construction of wind turbine, solar, biomass, and geothermal facilities, if such facilities generate electricity and the property is not included elsewhere under this section for purposes of providing an additional dollar amount.
