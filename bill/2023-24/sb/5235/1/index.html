<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there is a shortage of affordable housing units available for home ownership or long-term rental within most urban growth areas of the state. This lack of affordable housing forces many residents to spend more than 30 percent of their household income on housing, greatly increasing housing insecurity and contributing to the state's crisis of unacceptable numbers of persons experiencing homelessness. Increasing the availability of accessory dwelling units, also referred to as &quot;ADUs,&quot; may increase opportunities for people to age in their own home and increase multigenerational family ties along with offering opportunities to reduce intergenerational poverty by increasing home ownership. The legislature finds that accessory dwelling units can be one way to add affordable long-term housing and to provide a needed increase in housing density within urban growth areas with benefits to reducing fossil fuel use and other contributions to climate change due to housing and transportation patterns. The legislature seeks to encourage accessory dwelling unit availability as a modest housing option by streamlining local government regulations that may unintentionally make accessory dwelling units less economical. Since residents in a region may be choosing between cities, it is important to acknowledge that one city cannot build affordability on its own. An expansion in supply of affordable housing in a small city, but not neighboring cities, may satisfy some of the demand for affordable housing, but without a regional strategy, small cities will not be able to build affordability on their own. Statewide action is needed. Furthermore, the legislature finds that research from several cities shows that when accessory dwelling units are built or that are converted and offered for short-term rental for tourists and business visitors, they may not improve housing affordability. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to meet these important policy goals by increasing the availability of accessory dwelling units as modest housing options, limiting the restrictions that can be imposed on the development and use of accessory dwelling units within urban growth areas, and authorizing local governments to adopt programs to incentivize or reduce local government-imposed cost or time related obstacles to the development of accessory dwelling units when the accessory dwelling units will be utilized for long-term housing.</p>
