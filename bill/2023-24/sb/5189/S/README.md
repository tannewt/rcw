# SB 5189 - Behavioral health support

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5189-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that a behavioral health support specialist is a new member of the workforce in Washington state trained in the competencies developed by the University of Washington behavioral health support specialist clinical training program. The behavioral health support specialist clinical training program is characterized by brief, evidence-based interventions delivered to the intensity and expected duration of the behavioral health problem. The approach features routine outcome monitoring and regular, outcome-focused supervision. Use of behavioral health support specialists in Washington is expected to improve access to behavioral health services and ease workforce shortages while helping behavioral health professionals work at the top of their scope of practice.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Adult" means a person 18 years of age or older.

2. "Applicant" means a person who completes the required application, pays the required fee, is at least 18 years of age, and meets any background check requirements and uniform disciplinary act requirements.

"Behavioral health support specialist" means a person certified to deliver brief, evidence-based interventions with a scope of practice that includes behavioral health under the supervision of a Washington state credentialed provider who has the ability to assess, diagnose, and treat identifiable mental and behavioral health conditions as part of their scope of practice. A behavioral health support specialist does not have within their scope of practice the ability to make diagnoses but does track and monitor treatment response and outcomes using measurement-based care.

5. "Department" means the department of health.

6. "Registered apprenticeship" means an apprenticeship program approved by the Washington state apprenticeship and training council according to chapter 49.04 RCW.
