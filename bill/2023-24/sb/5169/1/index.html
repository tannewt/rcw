<p>The public employees' benefits board must allow medicare eligible retirees access to the uniform medical plan classic medicare.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the health care authority, consistent with the public employees' benefits board resolution 2022-16, will consult with active employees and retirees, by conducting listening sessions and facilitating public forums, to gather feedback about member needs and to explore more affordable government self-insured plans with benefits that are equal to or richer than uniform medical plan classic medicare. As such, the legislature intends that the results of stakeholder engagements will be used to inform future health care plan selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2023, the authority must report to the legislature with its findings of the stakeholder engagements in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
