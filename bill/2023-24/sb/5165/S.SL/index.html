<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the electric power system serving Washington will require additional high voltage transmission capacity to achieve the state's objectives and legal requirements. Washington must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under state law, and the 2021 state energy strategy finds that this will require a significant increase in the use of renewable or nonemitting electricity in place of fossil fuels now used in the transportation, industry, and building sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature anticipated the crucial role of additional transmission capacity in 2019 in the enactment of the clean energy transformation act and directed the energy facilities site evaluation council to convene a transmission corridors work group. The transmission corridors work group issued its final report on October 31, 2022, in which it confirmed the central role of transmission and recommended actions to achieve the expansion of transmission capacity to address this need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expanded transmission capacity and the more effective use of existing transmission capacity will provide benefits to electricity consumers in the state by enhancing the reliability of the electric power system and increasing access to more affordable sources of electricity within the state and across the western United States and Canada.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing constraints on transmission capacity within the state already present challenges in ensuring adequate and affordable supplies of clean electricity. Of particular concern is the capability of the transmission system to deliver clean electricity into and within the central Puget Sound area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are multiple issues that contribute to the challenge of making timely and cost-effective expansions of the high voltage transmission system. Among those challenges is the need for a more proactive transmission planning process using a longer planning period than current law requires. Transmission planning must reflect not just the requirements to connect individual generating resources to the grid but also the need to transfer electricity across the state and the west. Transmission planning must incorporate state policies and laws in planning objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certain transmission projects are of significant state interest due to their impact on the access of multiple utilities and communities to gain access to clean, affordable electricity supplies and obtain electricity that is necessary to comply with state laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends and affirms that the option to use local government permitting processes remains available for transmission projects not subject to mandatory jurisdiction under RCW 80.50.060(2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transmission projects typically take at least a decade to develop and permit. This timing presents particular challenges for achieving the state's greenhouse gas emissions reduction mandates, which include ambitious benchmarks as early as 2030. There is a need to accelerate the timeline for transmission development while still protecting other Washington values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some electric utilities rely entirely or primarily on a contracted network transmission provider for required transmission services. These electric utilities may contribute to the objectives of this act by requesting that each provider of network transmission service to the utilities include the provisions of chapter 288, Laws of 2019 and chapter 70A.45 RCW as public policy mandates in the transmission service provider's transmission planning process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each electric utility must develop a plan consistent with this section.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Utilities with more than 25,000 customers that are not full requirements customers must develop or update an integrated resource plan by September 1, 2008. At a minimum, progress reports reflecting changing conditions and the progress of the integrated resource plan must be produced every two years thereafter. An updated integrated resource plan must be developed at least every four years subsequent to the 2008 integrated resource plan. The integrated resource plan, at a minimum, must include:</p>

</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A lead agency conducting a project-level environmental review under this chapter of an electrical transmission facility with a nominal voltage of 230kV or greater must consider a nonproject environmental impact statement completed pursuant to section 6 of this act in order to identify and mitigate project-level probable significant adverse environmental impacts.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Project-level environmental review conducted pursuant to this chapter of an electrical transmission facility with a nominal voltage of 230kV or greater must begin with the review of the applicable nonproject environmental impact statement completed pursuant to section 6 of this act. The review must address any probable significant adverse environmental impacts associated with the proposal that were not analyzed in the nonproject environmental impact statements pursuant to section 6 of this act. The review must identify any mitigation measures specific to the project for probable significant adverse environmental impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead agencies reviewing site-specific project proposals for electrical transmission facilities with a nominal voltage of 230kV or greater shall use the nonproject review described in section 6 of this act through one of the following methods and in accordance with WAC 197-11-600, as it existed as of January 1, 2023:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Use of the nonproject review unchanged, in accordance with RCW 43.21C.034, if the project does not cause probable significant adverse environmental impact not identified in the nonproject review;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparation of an addendum;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporation by reference; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparation of a supplemental environmental impact statement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals for electrical transmission facilities with a nominal voltage of 230kV or greater following the recommendations developed in the nonproject environmental review completed pursuant to section 6 of this act are considered to have mitigated the probable significant adverse project-specific environmental impacts under this chapter for which recommendations were specifically developed unless the project-specific environmental review identifies project-level probable significant adverse environmental impacts not addressed in the nonproject environmental review.</p>
