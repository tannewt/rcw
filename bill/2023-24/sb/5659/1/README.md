## Section 1
The legislature finds that renewable energy resources are a critical component to reducing overall carbon emissions. The legislature further finds it prudent to incentivize development of multiple types of renewable energy infrastructure in order to maintain energy reliability, resiliency, and security as the state transitions toward decarbonizing its energy resources. Incentivizing development of renewable and sustainable energy resources includes both electric and gaseous fuel resources and should be made widely available to all interests, regardless of business structure or type. The legislature further finds that gaseous fuels are an important energy resource and intends to support the development of this resource as part of a diversified clean energy strategy that utilizes existing infrastructure that has been built out over the years through the regulated utility compact embodied in chapter 80.24 RCW. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide tax incentives to encourage the development of increased methane capture and processing for use as renewable natural gas and provide explicit regulatory certainty that will encourage utilities invest in carbon reduction, capture, and offset efforts on behalf of their customers.

## Section 2
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in sections 3 and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 3 and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to promote the development of renewable natural gas projects.

4. If a review finds that the total number of methane emission capture projects increase in number over the time of adoption of this exemption and the majority of those projects process the methane into renewable natural gas that is sold in Washington the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of this tax preference.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.

## Section 3

        ii.(A) Machinery and equipment is "used directly" in the generation of renewable natural gas if it gathers and processes methane into a usable form of natural gas that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.

(B) Machinery and equipment is "used directly" in the connection to existing natural gas infrastructure if it provides a mechanism to link a renewable natural gas facility to a natural gas pipeline.

    b. "Renewable natural gas" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 19.405.020.

4. A person claiming the retail sales tax exemption under this section must file an annual tax preference report with the department as required in RCW 82.32.534.

5. This section expires January 1, 2035.

## Section 4
1. [Empty]

    a. Beginning January 1, 2024, the provisions of this chapter do not apply to the use of machinery and equipment used directly in generating renewable natural gas, and labor and services rendered in respect to installing such machinery and equipment including, but not limited to, machinery, equipment, and labor at a facility capable of connecting to the existing natural gas infrastructure.

    b. Beginning January 1, 2024, the provisions of this chapter do not apply to the use of machinery and equipment used directly in connecting a renewable natural gas facility to an end user of the renewable natural gas or to the existing natural gas infrastructure, and labor and services rendered in respect to installing such machinery and equipment.

2. The eligibility requirements, conditions, and definitions in section 3 of this act apply to this section, including the filing of an annual tax preference report with the department under RCW 82.32.534.
