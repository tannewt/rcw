## Section 1
The definitions in this section apply throughout this section and sections 2 through 11 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Automated driving system" means the hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether it is limited to a specific operational design domain.

2. "Dynamic driving task" means all of the real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic, excluding the strategic functions such as trip scheduling and selection of destinations and waypoints, and including:

    a. Lateral vehicle motion control via steering;

    b. Longitudinal motion control via acceleration and deceleration;

    c. Monitoring the driving environment via object and event detection, recognition, classification, and response preparation;

    d. Object and event response execution;

    e. Maneuver planning; and

    f. Enhancing conspicuity via lighting, signaling, and gesturing.

3. "Dynamic driving task fallback" means the response by the person or human driver to either perform the dynamic driving task or achieve a minimal risk condition after the occurrence of any dynamic driving task performance-relevant system failure or upon operational design domain exit, or the response by an automated driving system to achieve minimal risk condition, given the same circumstances.

4. "Fully autonomous vehicle" means a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system designed to function without a human driver as a level four or five system under the society of automotive engineers international standard J3016B, as it existed on the effective date of this section, or such subsequent date as may be provided by the department by rule, consistent with the purposes of this section.

5. "Human driver" means a natural person in the vehicle with a valid license to operate a motor vehicle who controls all or part of the dynamic driving task.

6. "Minimal risk condition" means a condition to which a person, human driver, or an automated driving system may bring a vehicle after performing the dynamic driving task fallback in order to reduce the risk of a crash when a given trip cannot or should not be completed.

7. "On-demand autonomous vehicle network" means a transportation service network that uses a software application or other digital means to dispatch or otherwise enable the prearrangement of transportation with fully autonomous vehicles for purposes of transporting passengers or goods, including for-hire transportation and transportation of passengers or goods for compensation.

8. "Operational design domain" means operating conditions under which a given automated driving system is specifically designed to function including, but not limited to, environmental, geographical, and time-of-day restrictions, or the requisite presence or absence of certain traffic or roadway characteristics.

9. "Request to intervene" means notification by an automated driving system to a human driver, that the human driver should promptly begin or resume performance of part or all of the dynamic driving task.

## Section 2
1. A person may operate a fully autonomous vehicle on the public roadways of this state without a human driver when the automated driving system is engaged and the vehicle meets the following conditions:

    a. If a failure of the automated driving system occurs that renders that system unable to perform the entire dynamic driving task relevant to its intended operational design domain, the fully autonomous vehicle must achieve a minimal risk condition;

    b. The fully autonomous vehicle is capable of operating in compliance with the applicable traffic and motor vehicle safety laws and rules under this title when reasonable to do so, unless an exemption has been granted by the department; and

    c. When required by federal law, the vehicle displays the required manufacturer's certification label indicating that at the time of its manufacture it has been certified to be in compliance with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards, including reference to any exemption granted by the national highway traffic safety administration.

2. Before operating a fully autonomous vehicle on the public roadways of this state without a human driver, a person must submit a law enforcement interaction plan to the Washington state patrol that describes:

    a. How to communicate with a fleet support specialist who is available during the times the vehicle is in operation;

    b. How to safely remove the fully autonomous vehicle from the roadway and steps to safely tow the vehicle;

    c. How to recognize whether the fully autonomous vehicle is in autonomous mode; and

    d. Any additional information the manufacturer or owner deems necessary regarding hazardous conditions or public safety risks associated with the operation of the fully autonomous vehicle.

3. Before operating a fully autonomous vehicle on any public roadways, a person must:

    a. Submit to the department the most recent voluntary self-assessment that the person has submitted to the national highway traffic safety administration; and

    b. Until December 31, 2028, provide notice to the law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction over the area the person will operate the autonomous motor vehicle. Such notice must be provided within 14 days of operation and include the contact information of the owner of the autonomous vehicle and a copy of the law enforcement interaction plan described in subsection (2) of this section.

## Section 3
When an automated driving system installed on a motor vehicle is engaged:

1. The automated driving system is considered the driver or operator, for the purpose of assessing compliance with applicable traffic or motor vehicle laws under this title, and is deemed to satisfy electronically all physical acts required by a driver or operator of the vehicle; and

2. The automated driving system is considered to be licensed to drive under chapter 46.20 RCW to operate the vehicle.

## Section 4
Before operating a fully autonomous vehicle on public roadways in this state without a human driver, a person must submit proof of financial responsibility satisfactory to the department that the fully autonomous vehicle is covered by insurance or proof of self-insurance that satisfies the requirements of RCW 46.30.020.

## Section 5
1. In the event of an accident or collision involving a fully autonomous vehicle:

    a. The fully autonomous vehicle must remain on the scene of the accident or collision when required under RCW 46.52.020, consistent with its capability under section 2 of this act.

    b. The owner of the fully autonomous vehicle, or a person on behalf of the vehicle owner, must report the accident or collision consistent with RCW 46.52.030.

2. By February 1st of each year, and until February 1, 2028, the owner of the autonomous vehicle or a person on behalf of the vehicle owner must submit a report covering crashes or collisions required to be reported under subsection (1) of this section from the prior calendar year to the department and all municipalities where the autonomous vehicle operated for more than five calendar days in the prior calendar year.

## Section 6
