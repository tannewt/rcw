# SB 5372 - Trust land transfer program

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5372.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that some state lands and state forestlands have a low potential for natural resource management or low income-generating potential or are inefficient for the department of natural resources to manage due to geographic location or other factors.

2. The legislature further finds that some of these lands have high ecological values and public benefits and should be maintained in public ownership as a park, open space, nature preserve, or similar designation to benefit the people of Washington.

3. The legislature further finds that the department of natural resources needs an effective program to transfer these lands out of trust status to the natural areas program, other public agencies, or tribes, and simultaneously acquire legislative funding to acquire productive replacement lands to improve the revenue-generating performance of the state lands and state forestlands it manages.

4. The legislature further finds that the trust land transfer program should be established within the department of natural resources with adequate funds to cover the department's expenses for administering the program and completing trust land transfers.

5. The legislature further finds that there exists an interest by the public and trust beneficiaries that the program be well-documented and transparent, that each potential transfer be examined by the department of natural resources to ensure it is in the best interests of the trust beneficiaries, that an external advisory committee place proposed transfers into a prioritized order using standardized criteria, that the board of natural resources approve submission of the list to the legislature, and that parcels be transferred in order of priority.

## Section 2
1. The department is authorized to create and manage a trust land transfer program. Real property available for the trust land transfer program is economically under-performing state land and state forestland with high ecological or public benefit and deemed appropriate for state parks, fish and wildlife habitats, natural area preserves, natural resources conservation areas, community forests, recreation, or other public purposes. The department may use the real property transfer authorities under this chapter and chapter 79.22 RCW, as appropriate, to complete transfers under the trust land transfer program.

2. The department shall use legislative appropriations for approved trust land transfers to acquire replacement real property that will provide long-term, sustainable revenue to the trust beneficiaries or is otherwise desirable to be added to the affected trust and to pay for the department's administrative expenses to complete the transfer, including the cost of department staff time, appraisals, surveys, environmental reviews, and other similar costs of the program.

## Section 3
The department shall administer the trust land transfer program as follows:

1. Any citizen, state and federal agencies, counties, cities, towns, tribes, nonprofit organizations, special purpose districts, public development authorities, and other political subdivisions of the state, may nominate a parcel of state land or state forestland for the trust land transfer program. The nomination must be made to the department on forms provided by the department and accompanied by the fee provided under RCW 79.02.250.

2. The department shall perform an initial review to determine whether the transfer of a nominated parcel is in the best interest of the trust for which the land is held and whether a public agency, as defined in RCW 79.17.200, is willing to take ownership of the parcel and is capable of managing the land for the public benefit. The department may require prenomination review of parcels over 9,000 acres or parcels over an estimated appraised market value of $30,000,000, including the value of the land, valuable materials, and improvements, if any.

3. If the department determines through its initial review that transfer would be in the best interest of the trust for which the land is held and a public agency is willing and able to take ownership and manage the land, the department shall consult with potentially affected tribes to identify and address cultural resource issues.

4. Following the department's initial review and tribal consultation, the department may submit parcels to an advisory committee that shall evaluate and prioritize nominated parcels according to criteria approved by the board, including social, ecological, economic, and other values. The advisory committee may include representatives of trust beneficiaries, public agencies, tribes, overburdened communities, and vulnerable populations as defined in chapter 70A.02 RCW, and other stakeholders as determined by the department.

5. The department, with approval of the board, shall determine the final, prioritized list of trust land transfer parcels to submit to the legislature for funding. If a legislative appropriation includes a trust land transfer parcel, and the board determines that the transfer is in the best interest of the trust for which the land is held, the department shall complete the transfer.

## Section 4
1. The board of county commissioners of any county and/or the mayor and city council or city commission of any city or town and/or the board shall have authority to exchange, each with the other, or with the federal forest service, the federal government or any proper agency thereof and/or with any private landowner, county land of any character, land owned by municipalities of any character, and state forestland owned by the state under the jurisdiction of the department, for real property of equal value for the purpose of consolidating and blocking up the respective landholdings of any county, municipality, the federal government, or the state of Washington or for the purpose of obtaining lands having commercial recreational leasing potential. The board shall also have the authority to exchange state forestland for the purpose of obtaining land with greater natural resource or income-producing potential, when in the best interest of the state or affected trust. State forestland exchanged under this section may not be used to reduce the publicly owned forestland base.

2.

Prior to executing an exchange under this section, and in addition to the public notice requirements set forth in RCW 79.17.050, the department shall consult with legislative members, other state and federal agencies, local governments, tribes, local stakeholders, conservation groups, and any other interested parties to identify and address cultural resource issues, and the potential of the state lands proposed for exchange to be used for open space, park, school, or critical habitat purposes.

## Section 5
1. The legislature finds that the department has a need to maintain the real property asset base it manages and needs an accounting mechanism to complete transactions without reducing the real property asset base.

2. The natural resources real property replacement account is created in the state treasury. This account shall consist of funds, including the value of land, timber, other valuable materials, and improvements owned by the state, transferred or paid for the disposal or transfer of real property by the department under RCW 79.17.200 and the transfer of state lands or state forestlands into community forest trust lands under RCW 79.155.040. The funds in this account shall be used solely for the acquisition of replacement real property and may be spent only when, and as, authorized by legislative appropriation.

## Section 6
1. With the approval of the board, the department may directly transfer or dispose of state forestlands without public auction, if the transfers are:

    a.

In lieu of condemnation or to resolve trespass and property ownership disputes and the lands consist of 10 contiguous acres or less or have a value of $25,000 or less; or

    b. To public agencies as defined in RCW 79.17.200.

2. Real property to be transferred or disposed of under this section shall be transferred or disposed of only after appraisal and for at least fair market value, and only if the transaction is in the best interest of the state or affected trust. Valuable materials attached to lands to be transferred under subsection (1)(b) of this section must be appraised at the fair market value without consideration of management or regulatory encumbrances associated with wildlife species listed under the federal endangered species act, if any.

3. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in  this subsection, the proceeds from real property transferred or disposed of under this section shall be deposited into the parkland trust revolving fund and be solely used to buy replacement forestland for the benefit of the county from which the property was transferred or disposed and the department's administrative expenses to complete the transfer, including the cost of department staff time, appraisals, surveys, environmental reviews, and other similar costs of the transfer. The legislative authority of the county from which the real property was transferred or disposed under subsection (1)(b) of this section may request in writing that the department distribute a percentage of the proceeds associated with valuable materials. Upon such a request, and subject to prior approval by the board, the department shall distribute the requested percentage of proceeds associated with valuable materials as provided in RCW 79.64.110.

    b. The proceeds from real property transferred or disposed of under  this section for the purpose of participating in the state forestland pool created under RCW 79.22.140 must be deposited into the parkland trust revolving fund and used to buy replacement forestland for the benefit of that county as provided in RCW 79.64.110 and located within any county participating in the land pool.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in counties with a population of 25,000 or less, the portion of the proceeds associated with valuable materials on state forestland transferred under  this section must be distributed as provided in RCW 79.64.110. If requested in writing by the legislative authority of a county participating in the state forestland pool created under RCW 79.22.140, the portion of the proceeds associated with valuable materials on state forestland transferred under  this section must be deposited in the parkland trust revolving fund and used to buy replacement forestland for the benefit of that county as provided in RCW 79.64.110 and located within any county participating in the land pool.

## Section 7
1. The parkland trust revolving fund is to be utilized by the department for the purpose of acquiring real property, including all reasonable costs associated with these acquisitions, as a replacement for the property transferred to the state parks and recreation commission, as directed by the legislature in order to maintain the land base of the affected trusts or under RCW 79.22.060 and to receive voluntary contributions for the purpose of operating and maintaining public use and recreation facilities, including trails, managed by the department.

The department may seek voluntary contributions from individuals and organizations for this purpose. Voluntary contributions will be deposited into the parkland trust revolving fund and used solely for the purpose of public use and recreation facilities operations and maintenance. Voluntary contributions are not considered a fee for use of these facilities.

## Section 9
The department, with the approval of the board, may purchase property at fair market value to be held in a land bank, which is hereby created within the department.
