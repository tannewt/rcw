# SB 5688 - Providing carbon sequestration and ecosystem services in the management of public lands.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5688.pdf)

## Section 101
1. The legislature finds that the climate commitment act, which established a cap and invest program under chapter 70A.65 RCW, makes Washington state a leader in climate policy and, through the codification of carbon offset projects, creates a new way for revenue to be generated from lands and waters in the state while advancing the state's greenhouse gas emissions policies. Carbon offset projects established for this program must primarily benefit the people of Washington by being located on Washington lands and waters to the extent possible, rather than outside the state. In addition to this program, there are emerging carbon offset markets, both regulatory and voluntary, in which land managing state agencies and local governments may obtain financial benefits through management agreements that increase carbon sequestration, also helping to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate disruption. The legislature further finds that the department of ecology should provide technical assistance to state agencies and local governments seeking to sponsor carbon offset credit projects on their lands in a manner that will meet the climate commitment act requirements.

2. Therefore, it is the intent of this act to authorize the department of ecology to provide technical assistance to any state agency or local government seeking to sponsor carbon offset projects that will qualify as offset credits under the climate commitment act. Further, it is the intent of this act to provide the department of natural resources with specific authority, procedures, and criteria for development and implementation of carbon storage projects and associated ecosystem services.

## Section 2
The department must establish a program to provide assistance to any state agency or local government seeking to develop an offset program relating to lands managed by the agency or local government. The assistance may include, but is not limited to, funding or technical assistance to assess a project's technical feasibility, investment requirements, development and operational costs, expected returns, administrative and legal hurdles, and project risks and pitfalls.

## Section 301
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Carbon credit" means one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent removed from the atmosphere or prevented from being emitted into the atmosphere as a result of a carbon offset project and within a carbon market transaction.

2. "Carbon offset project" has the same meaning as "offset project" as defined in RCW 70A.65.010.

    a. "Ecosystem service" means the outputs, conditions, or processes of natural systems that directly or indirectly benefit humans or enhance social welfare.

4. "Ecosystem service credit" means a predetermined and standardized unit that represents a measurable ecosystem service provided in the context of a payment for an ecosystem service project.

5. "Ecosystem service marketplace" means an environmental commodity market that brings together buyers, sellers, and investors to exchange ecosystem services as tangible commodities in exchange for compensation.

6. "Ecosystem service project broker" means an entity that facilitates the process of matching ecosystem service providers and purchasers of ecosystem service project credits. An ecosystem service project broker may sell or procure credits on their clients' behalf and provide financing and marketing expertise. Ecosystem service project brokers may also act as ecosystem service project developers.

7. "Ecosystem service project developer" means an entity that sources and initiates ecosystem service projects on behalf of the ecosystem service provider including, but not limited to, by working with ecosystem service project standards and verification bodies, bearing financial risks of projects, and working with a network of distributors and retailers to deliver auditable ecosystem service project credits to a marketplace. An ecosystem service project developer may also act as an ecosystem service project broker.

8. "Payment for ecosystem service project" means a transaction within an ecosystem service marketplace that transfers financial incentives to ecosystem service providers that are conditional on the provision of the service. Project types include, but are not limited to, carbon offset projects.

## Section 302
1. The department is authorized to enter into contracts for payment for ecosystem service projects on terms and conditions acceptable to the department for the purpose of generating revenue by providing ecosystem services that directly or indirectly benefit humans or enhance social welfare. The contract term may last a period of up to 125 years. Proceeds from contracts for ecosystem services must be deposited into the appropriate account in the state treasury.

2. The department may enter into payment for ecosystem service projects on all public lands managed by the department.

3. The department may:

    a. Directly offer for sale ecosystem service credits with established compliance or voluntary ecosystem service marketplaces.

    b. Enter into contracts with ecosystem service project developers or brokers, through public auction or by direct negotiation, to bring ecosystem service credits to market. Contracts for ecosystem services are subject to rules adopted by the board.

4. Notice of intent to contract by negotiation must be published on the department's website. The notice must be published within the 90 days preceding commencement of negotiations.

5. The department is authorized to conduct any additional advertising that it determines to be in the best interest of the state.

6. The department may enter into contracts or agreements with third-party ecosystem service project developers or brokers for purposes that include, but are not limited to, determining the feasibility of entering into a contract for a payment for an ecosystem service project, establishing a payment for an ecosystem service project with an ecosystem service marketplace, and marketing and selling credits on an established ecosystem service marketplace.

7. The department must provide a report to the board upon execution of a contract for a payment for an ecosystem service project that includes the term of the contract and projected revenues.

## Section 303
1. Before entering into the sale of ecosystem service credits under this chapter, the board must approve contract terms and a minimum payment for ecosystem services that is valid for a period of 180 days, or a longer period as may be established by resolution. The board may reestablish the minimum payment at any time. For any ecosystem service credit sales that the board is required by law to approve, the board may by resolution transfer this authority to the commissioner.

2. Where the board has set a minimum payment for ecosystem service credits, the department may set the final payment for ecosystem service credits, which must be based on current market prices.
