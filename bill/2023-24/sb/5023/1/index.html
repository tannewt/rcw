<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>All emergency tow trucks shall be identified by an intermittent or revolving red light capable of 360degree visibility at a distance of 500 feet under normal atmospheric conditions.

It is unlawful to use the combination of lights when traveling to or from the scene of an accident or for any other purpose.</p>
