<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to use funds from the climate commitment act to promote the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels, thereby growing the clean energy sector, addressing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating family wage manufacturing jobs in Washington. Sustainable aviation fuels represent the most significant near and midterm opportunity for aviation to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The use of sustainable aviation fuels will also improve air quality for airport workers and communities surrounding airports. While many efforts are underway to advance the use of sustainable aviation fuels, this act is intended to assist and accelerate those efforts.</p>
