## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to require online marketplaces to verify certain information regarding high-volume third-party sellers of consumer products. It is also the intent of the legislature for online marketplaces to be transparent about the consumer products they sell and to disclose to consumers contact and other information concerning third-party sellers.

        i. To the online marketplace; or

        ii. To a payment processor or other third party contracted by the online marketplace to maintain such information, provided that the online marketplace ensures that it can obtain such information on demand from such payment processor or other third party;

    b. Contact information for such seller as follows:

        i. With respect to a high-volume third-party seller that is an individual, the individual's name; or

        ii. With respect to a high-volume third-party seller that is not an individual, one of the following forms of contact information:

(A) A copy of a valid government-issued identification for an individual acting on behalf of such seller that includes the individual's name; or

(B) A copy of a valid government-issued record or tax document that includes the business name and physical address of such seller;

2. Notification of change and annual certification. An online marketplace shall:

    a. Periodically, but not less than annually, notify any high-volume third-party seller on such online marketplace's platform of the requirement to keep any information collected under subsection (1) of this section current; and

    b. Require any high-volume third-party seller on such online marketplace's platform to, not later than 10 days after receiving notice under (a) of this subsection, electronically certify that:

        i. The seller has provided any changes to such information to the online marketplace, if any such changes have occurred;

        ii. There have been no changes to such seller's information; or

        iii. Such seller has provided any changes to such information to the online marketplace.

3. Suspension. In the event that a high-volume third-party seller does not provide the information or certification required under this section, the online marketplace shall, after providing the seller with written or electronic notice and an opportunity to provide such information or certification not later than 10 days after the issuance of such notice, suspend any future sales activity of such seller until such seller provides such information or certification.

4. Verification. An online marketplace shall:

    a. Verify the information collected under subsection (1) of this section not later than 10 days after such collection; and

    b. Verify any change to such information not later than 10 days after being notified of such change by a high-volume third-party seller under subsection (2) of this section.

5. Presumption of verification. In the case of a high-volume third-party seller that provides a copy of a valid government-issued tax document, any information contained in such document shall be presumed to be verified as of the date of issuance of such document.

6. Data use limitation. Data collected solely to comply with the requirements of this section may not be used for any other purpose unless required by law.

7. Data security requirement. An online marketplace shall implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, appropriate to the nature of the data and the purposes for which the data will be used, to protect the data collected to comply with the requirements of this section from unauthorized use, disclosure, access, destruction, or modification.

8. Disclosure required. An online marketplace shall:

    a. Require any high-volume third-party seller with an aggregate total of $20,000 or more in annual gross revenues on such online marketplace, and that uses such online marketplace's platform, to provide the information described in subsection (9) of this section to the online marketplace; and

    b. Disclose the information described in subsection (9) of this section to consumers in a clear and conspicuous manner:

        i. In the order confirmation message or other document or communication made to a consumer after a purchase is finalized; and

    a. Subject to subsection (10) of this section, the identity of the high-volume third-party seller, including:

        i. The full name of the seller, which may include the seller name or seller's company name, or the name by which the seller or company operates on the online marketplace;

        ii. The physical address of the seller; and

        iii. Contact information for the seller, to allow for the direct, unhindered communication with high-volume third-party sellers by users of the online marketplace, including:

(C) Other means of direct electronic messaging, which may be provided to such seller by the online marketplace; and

    b. Whether the high-volume third-party seller used a different seller to supply the consumer product to the consumer upon purchase, and, upon the request of an authenticated purchaser, the information described in (a) of this subsection relating to any such seller that supplied the consumer product to the purchaser, if such seller is different than the high-volume third-party seller listed on the product listing prior to purchase.

10. Exception. Subject to subsection (9) of this section, upon the request of a high-volume third-party seller, an online marketplace may provide for partial disclosure of the identity information required under subsection (9)(a) of this section in the following situations:

    a. If such seller certifies to the online marketplace that the seller does not have a business address and only has a residential street address, or has a combined business and residential address, the online marketplace may:

        i. Disclose only the country and, if applicable, the state in which such seller resides; and

11. Limitation on exception. If an online marketplace becomes aware that a high-volume third-party seller has made a false representation to the online marketplace in order to justify the provision of a partial disclosure under subsection (10) of this section or that a high-volume third-party seller who has requested and received a provision for a partial disclosure under subsection (10) of this section has not provided responsive answers within a reasonable time frame to consumer inquiries submitted to the seller by phone, email, or other means of electronic messaging provided to such seller by the online marketplace, the online marketplace shall, after providing the seller with written or electronic notice and an opportunity to respond not later than 10 days after the issuance of such notice, suspend any future sales activity of such seller unless such seller consents to the disclosure of the identity information required under subsection (9)(a) of this section.

12. Reporting mechanism. An online marketplace shall disclose to consumers in a clear and conspicuous manner on the product listing of any high-volume third-party seller a reporting mechanism that allows for electronic and telephonic reporting of suspicious marketplace activity to the online marketplace.
