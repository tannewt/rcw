<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state has made groundbreaking investments in state-of-the-art mass transit and intermodal infrastructure. The legislature finds that to maximize the state's return on these investments, land use policies and practices must keep pace with progress being implemented in transportation infrastructure development. The legislature also intends new development to reflect the state's commitment to vibrant, walkable, accessible urban environments that improve health, expand multimodal transportation options, and include varied community facilities, parks, and green spaces that are open to people of all income levels.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that cities planning under chapter 36.70A RCW require direction and technical assistance to ensure the benefits of state transportation investments are maximized and shared equitably while avoiding unnecessary programmatic and cost burdens to local governments in their comprehensive planning, code enactment, and permit processing workloads. The legislature further recognizes that regulatory flexibility and local control are also important features of optimal planning outcomes.</p>

<li>
<p>To encourage transit-oriented development and transit use and resulting substantial environmental benefits, counties and cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may not require off-street parking as a condition of permitting development within a station area, except for off-street parking that is permanently marked for the exclusive use of individuals with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a project permit application within a station area, as defined in RCW 36.70B.020, does not provide parking in compliance with this section, the proposed absence of parking may not be treated as a basis for issuance of a determination of significance pursuant to chapter 43.21C RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parking provisions of this section do not apply if the city or county consults with the department of transportation and the city or county and the department of transportation determine that the lack of minimum parking requirements in a defined area would make on-street parking infeasible or unsafe for the authorized units.</p>
</li>

<p>The purpose of this section is to provide cities and counties with additional flexibility to accommodate infill development, as well as to facilitate the timely and certain deployment of sustainable transit-oriented development, and thereby realize the goals and policies of comprehensive plans adopted according to chapter 36.70A RCW.</p>

<p>A city or county planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may establish categorical exemptions from the requirements of this chapter if it meets the following criteria:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Residential development;</p>

<li>
<p>Mixed-use development; or</p>

<p>Commercial development up to 65,000 square feet, excluding retail development;</p>
