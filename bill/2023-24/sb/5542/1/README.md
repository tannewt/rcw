# SB 5542 - Vehicle charging equipment

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5542.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that electric vehicle charging equipment made available for commercial or public use is susceptible to vandalism and theft because the equipment may contain metal components that thieves will seek to steal and sell. In order to discourage the destruction of electric vehicle charging equipment, the legislature finds that such equipment should be defined as commercial metal property and therefore be made subject to the same sale restrictions that apply to other commercial metal property.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
