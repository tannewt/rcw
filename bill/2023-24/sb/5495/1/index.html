<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2027, each claimant meeting the conditions of this section is eligible for a primary residence property tax exemption. The exemption is in the form of a refund of state property taxes paid and is equal to an amount as determined under subsections (2) and (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2027, the primary residence property tax exemption is equal to the amount of state property taxes on up to $250,000 of the assessed valuation of the claimant's qualified residence used to calculate the property taxes due on the qualified residence for the calendar year for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of determining the primary residence property tax exemption for taxes levied for collection in each subsequent calendar year, the assessed value component of the exemption must be increased from the prior year. The amount of such increase for a year is equal to the percentage growth in the state property taxes levied for collection in the preceding year as compared to the state property taxes levied for collection two years ago. Beginning January 31, 2028, and by January 31st each year thereafter, the department is responsible for determining the increase in the assessed value component of the primary residence property tax exemption and may round the dollar amount of the assessed value increase to the nearest $1,000. The department must publish the adjusted assessed value component of this exemption on its website.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When an exemption amount determined under subsection (2) of this section is less than the maximum possible exemption under that subsection, the department must adjust the exemption amount determined under subsection (2) of this section. An exemption amount under this subsection (3) is equal to the equalized assessed value of the claimant's qualified residence multiplied by the aggregate state property tax rates for the county in which the qualified residence is located for taxes levied for collection in the year in which the application for the primary residence property tax exemption is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection (3), &quot;equalized assessed value&quot; means the lesser of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The assessed value of the claimant's qualified residence used to calculate the property taxes due for the year for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed, divided by the county's combined indicated ratio used by the department to determine the equalized state levy for collection in that same year for the county in which the claimant's qualified residence is located; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$250,000 for an exemption for state property taxes levied for collection in 2027, or, for subsequent years, the applicable assessed value determined by the department as provided in subsection (2)(b) of this section for state property taxes levied for collection in the year for which the exemption under this section is claimed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>The department must provide a claimant a paper application upon request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The claimant or the claimant's designated legal representative must sign the application attesting that the property for which the primary residence property tax exemption sought is the claimant's principal place of residence and to the truth of the other information in the application. If the claimant holds a life estate in the qualified residence for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed and the claimant is not the taxpayer of record, the taxpayer of record must also sign the application. The signature requirements in this subsection (5)(b) may be met by an electronic signature. All signatures on an application must be made under penalty of perjury as provided in chapter 9A.72 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice of the primary residence property tax exemption and where to obtain further information about the exemption must be included on or with property tax statements and revaluation notices for residential property. The department and each county assessor and county treasurer are required to publicize the qualifications and manner of making claims for the primary residence property tax exemption, including paid advertisements or notices as deemed appropriate in the sole discretion of the department and county assessors and county treasurers.</p>

<p>The following conditions apply to the primary residence property tax exemption:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All property taxes due on the qualified residence must be paid in full for the year in which the application required under this section is submitted before the department makes a refund under this section to the claimant.

</li>
<li>
<p>The qualified residence must be occupied as the claimant's principal place of residence as of the date of the signed application required under subsection (5) of this section. No claimant may receive the primary residence property tax exemption on more than one qualified residence in any calendar year.

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The qualified residence is temporarily unoccupied;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The qualified residence is occupied by the claimant's spouse or state registered domestic partner or a person financially dependent on the claimant for support; or</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Where a claimant has a life estate in, and is not the taxpayer of record for, their qualified residence, the claimant is not entitled to the exemption under this section unless the taxpayer of record confirms, in a form and manner required by the department, that the claimant is required to reimburse the taxpayer of record for the property taxes due on the claimant's qualified residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The claimant must not have received a renter's credit for the same year for which a primary residence property tax exemption is claimed, except:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any fiscal period, the primary residence property tax exemption under this section must be approved by the legislature in the omnibus appropriations act before persons may claim the exemption during the fiscal period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature may limit eligibility for the primary residence property tax exemption to low-income households if the proposed amendment to Article VII of the state Constitution repealing the uniformity clause (Senate Joint Resolution No. . . . (S-0739/23)) is validly submitted to and is approved and ratified by the voters.</p>

Except as provided in this subsection, in the notice of appeal the taxpayer must set forth the amount of the tax which the taxpayer contends should be reduced or refunded and the reasons for such reduction or refund, in accordance with rules of practice and procedure prescribed by the board. However, if the notice of appeal relates to an application made to the department under chapter 82.34 RCW, the taxpayer must set forth the amount to which the taxpayer claims the credit or exemption should apply, and the grounds for such contention, in accordance with rules of practice and procedure prescribed by the board. If the notice of appeal relates to a determination under section 6 of this act, the notice must include an explanation of why the department's determination is incorrect. The board must transmit a copy of the notice of appeal to the department and all other named parties within thirty days of its receipt by the board. If the taxpayer intends that the hearing before the board be held pursuant to the administrative procedure act (chapter 34.05 RCW), the notice of appeal must also so state. In the event that the notice of appeal does not so state, the department may, within thirty days from the date of its receipt of the notice of appeal, file with the board notice of its intention that the hearing be held pursuant to the administrative procedure act.</p>
