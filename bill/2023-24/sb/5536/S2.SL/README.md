7. A person who is a family member of a homicide victim may apply to the sentencing court on the behalf of the victim for vacation of the victim's record of conviction for prostitution under RCW 9A.88.030.

A vacated conviction under this section is not considered a conviction of such an offense for the purposes of 27 C.F.R. 478.11.

    c. A conviction vacated on or after July 28, 2019, qualifies as a prior conviction for the purpose of charging a present recidivist offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 occurring on or after July 28, 2019.

9. The clerk of the court in which the vacation order is entered shall immediately transmit the order vacating the conviction to the Washington state patrol identification section and to the local police agency, if any, which holds criminal history information for the person who is the subject of the conviction. The Washington state patrol and any such local police agency shall immediately update their records to reflect the vacation of the conviction, and shall transmit the order vacating the conviction to the federal bureau of investigation.

## Section 25
1. Each behavioral health administrative services organization shall establish  recovery navigator programs with the goal of providing law enforcement and other criminal legal system personnel with a credible alternative to further legal system involvement for criminal activity that stems from unmet behavioral health needs or poverty. The programs shall work to improve community health and safety by reducing individuals' involvement with the criminal legal system through the use of specific human services tools and in coordination with community input. Each program must include a dedicated project manager and be governed by a policy coordinating group comprised, in alignment with the core principles, of local executive and legislative officials, public safety agencies, including police and prosecutors, and civil rights, public defense, and human services organizations.

2. The recovery navigator programs shall be organized on a scale that permits meaningful engagement, collaboration, and coordination with local law enforcement and municipal agencies through the policy coordinating groups. The programs shall provide community-based outreach, intake, assessment, and connection to services and, as appropriate, long-term intensive case management and recovery coaching services, to youth and adults with substance use disorder, including for persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, who are referred to the program from diverse sources and shall facilitate and coordinate connections to a broad range of community resources for youth and adults with substance use disorder, including treatment and recovery support services. Recovery navigator programs must serve and prioritize individuals who are actually or potentially exposed to the criminal legal system with respect to unlawful behavior connected to substance use or other behavioral health issues.

3. By June 30, 2024, the authority shall revise its uniform program standards for behavioral health administrative services organizations to follow in the design of their recovery navigator programs to achieve fidelity with the core principles. The uniform program standards must be modeled upon the components of the law enforcement assisted diversion program and address project management, field engagement, biopsychosocial assessment, intensive case management and care coordination, stabilization housing when available and appropriate, and, as necessary, legal system coordination for participants' legal cases that may precede or follow referral to the program. The uniform program standards must incorporate the law enforcement assisted diversion framework for diversion at multiple points of engagement with the criminal legal system, including prearrest, prebooking, prefiling, and for ongoing case conferencing with law enforcement, prosecutors, community stakeholders, and program case managers. The authority must adopt the uniform program standards from the components of the law enforcement assisted diversion program to accommodate an expanded population of persons with substance use disorders, including persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, provide for referrals from a broad range of sources, and require prioritization of those who are or likely will be exposed to the criminal legal system related to their behavioral health challenges. In addition to accepting referrals from law enforcement and courts of limited jurisdiction, the uniform program standards must provide guidance for accepting referrals on behalf of persons with substance use disorders, including persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, from various sources including, but not limited to, self-referral, family members of the individual, emergency department personnel, persons engaged with serving homeless persons, including those living unsheltered or in encampments, fire department personnel, emergency medical service personnel, community-based organizations, members of the business community, harm reduction program personnel, faith-based organization staff, and other sources within the criminal legal system, so that individuals are engaged as early as possible within the sequential intercept model. In developing response time requirements within the statewide program standards, the authority shall require, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, that responses to referrals from law enforcement occur immediately for in-custody referrals and shall strive for rapid response times to other appropriate settings such as emergency departments and courts of limited jurisdiction.

4. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the authority shall provide funding to each behavioral health administrative services organization for the continuation of and, as required by this section, the revisions to and reorganization of the recovery navigator programs they fund. Before receiving funding for implementation and ongoing administration, each behavioral health administrative services organization must submit a program plan that demonstrates the ability to fully comply with statewide program standards. The authority shall establish a schedule for the regular review of recovery navigator programs funded by behavioral health administrative services organizations. The authority shall arrange for technical assistance to be provided by the LEAD national support bureau to all behavioral health administrative services organizations, the authority, contracted providers, and independent stakeholders and partners, such as prosecuting attorneys and law enforcement.

5. Each behavioral health administrative services organization must have a substance use disorder regional administrator for its recovery navigator program. The regional administrator shall be responsible for assuring compliance with program standards, including staffing standards. Each recovery navigator program must maintain a sufficient number of appropriately trained personnel for providing intake and referral services, conducting comprehensive biopsychosocial assessments, providing intensive case management services, and making warm handoffs to treatment and recovery support services along the continuum of care. Program staff must include people with lived experience with substance use disorder to the extent possible. The substance use disorder regional administrator must assure that staff who are conducting intake and referral services and field assessments are paid a livable and competitive wage and have appropriate initial training and receive continuing education.

6. Each recovery navigator program must submit quarterly reports to the authority with information identified by the authority and the substance use recovery services advisory committee. The reports must be provided to the substance use recovery services advisory committee for discussion at meetings following the submission of the reports.

7. No civil liability may be imposed by any court on the state or its officers or employees, an appointed or elected official, public employee, public agency as defined in RCW 4.24.470, combination of units of government and its employees as provided in RCW 36.28A.010, nonprofit community-based organization, tribal government entity, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization, based on the administration of a recovery navigator program except upon proof of bad faith or gross negligence.
