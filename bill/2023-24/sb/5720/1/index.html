<p>With the prior approval of the commissioner, a property insurer may include the following either goods or services, or both, intended to reduce either the probability of loss, or the extent of loss, or both, from a covered event as part of a policy of property insurance:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Goods, including a water monitor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foundation strapping to mitigate losses due to earthquake;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing services, including home safety monitoring or brush clearing to mitigate losses due to wildfire; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other either goods or services, or both, as the commissioner may identify by rule.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any goods provided are owned by the insured, even if the insurance is subsequently canceled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of goods and services to be provided is limited to one thousand five hundred dollars in value in the aggregate in any twelve-month period.</p>
</li>

The commissioner may disapprove any proposed noninsurance benefit that the commissioner determines may tend to promote or facilitate the violation of any other section of this title. However, if the commissioner approves the inclusion of either the goods or services, or both, in a policy of property insurance it does not constitute a violation of RCW 48.30.140 or 48.30.150.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A property insurer may conduct a pilot program as either a risk mitigation or prevention, or both, strategy through which the insurer offers or provides risk mitigation and/or prevention goods and/or services identified in subsection (1) of this section in connection with an insurance policy covering property risks in accordance with rules adopted by the commissioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A property insurer offering or providing risk mitigation and/or prevention goods and/or services through a pilot program under this subsection is exempt from including information about the risk mitigation and/or prevention goods and/or services in its rate filing as is otherwise required under subsection (4) of this section and RCW 48.19.530.</p>
