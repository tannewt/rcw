## Section 1
1. The governing bodies of counties and cities may amend the codes enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 as amended and adopted by the state building code council as they apply within their respective jurisdictions, but the amendments shall not result in a code that is less than the minimum performance standards and objectives contained in the state building code except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

    a. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no amendment to a code enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 as amended and adopted by the state building code council that affects single-family or multifamily residential buildings shall be effective unless the amendment is approved by the building code council under RCW 19.27.074(1)(b).

    b. Any county or city amendment to a code enumerated in RCW 19.27.031 which is approved under RCW 19.27.074(1)(b) shall continue to be effective after any action is taken under RCW 19.27.074(1)(a) without necessity of reapproval under RCW 19.27.074(1)(b) unless the amendment is declared null and void by the council at the time any action is taken under RCW 19.27.074(1)(a) because such action in any way altered the impact of the amendment.

2. The legislative body of a county or city, in exercising the authority provided under subsection (1) of this section to amend the code enumerated in RCW 19.27.031(1)(b), may adopt amendments that eliminate any minimum gross floor area requirement for single-family detached dwellings or that provide a minimum gross floor area requirement below the minimum performance standards and objectives contained in the state building code.

3. The legislative body of a county or city, in exercising the authority provided under subsection (1) of this section to amend the code enumerated in RCW 19.27.031(1)(b), may adopt amendments that allow for up to five stories of group R-2 occupancy to be served by a single exit under the following conditions:

    c. The building does not have more than four dwellings on any floor;

Dwelling unit doors must not open directly into an interior exit stairway. Dwelling unit doors are permitted to open directly into an exterior stairway;

    h. There are not more than 20 feet of travel to the exit stairway from the entry/exit door of any dwelling unit;

    i. Travel distance measured in accordance with section 1017 of the International Building Code does not exceed 125 feet;

    j. The exit does not terminate in an egress court where the court depth exceeds the court width unless it is possible to exit in either direction to the public way;

    k. Elevators are pressurized in accordance with section 909.21 of the International Building Code or open into elevator lobbies that comply with section 713.14 of the International Building Code.

        i. Other occupancies are permitted in the same building provided they comply with all other requirements of this subsection (3). Except as provided in (l)(ii) of this subsection, other occupancies must not communicate with the group R occupancy portion of the building or with the single-exit stairway;

        ii. Parking garages and occupied roofs accessory to the group R occupancy are permitted to communicate with the exit stairway;

    m. The exit serving the group R occupancy does not discharge through any other occupancy, including an accessory parking garage; and

    n. There are no openings within 10 feet of unprotected openings into the stairway other than required exit doors having a one-hour fire-resistance rating.

    a. A city that intends to adopt amendments under subsection (3) of this section must meet the following criteria prior to adoption:

        i. The city is served by a municipal fire department or fire district; and

        ii. The city does not have a current restriction on development due to lack of fire flow capacity as set forth in WAC 246-290-221. Minimum fire flow capacity must be at least 750 gallons per minute for 60 minutes, as set forth in WAC 246-293-640.
