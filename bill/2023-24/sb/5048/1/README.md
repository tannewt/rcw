2. Beginning with the 2023-2025 omnibus operating appropriation act, the legislature must pass an omnibus operating appropriations act that appropriates to the state board of community and technical colleges and each of the public four-year institutions of higher education state funding for college in high school courses administered at public secondary schools.

3. State appropriations for the college in the high school program to the institutions of higher education shall be calculated as follows: The total college in the high school courses administered in the prior academic year, funded at a rate of:

    a. $6,000 per college in the high school course administered by a public four-year institution of higher education; or

    b. $3,000 per college in the high school course administered by a community or technical college.

4. Beginning with fiscal year 2025 the rate per college in the high school course administered must be adjusted annually for inflation as measured by the consumer price index.

5. State appropriations must be based on the total number of college in the high school courses administered by an institution of higher education for the academic year immediately prior to the current fiscal year. The state appropriation is based on course administration data submitted annually by October 15th to the office of financial management and legislative fiscal staff.

6. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Community or technical college" has the same meaning as provided for under RCW 28B.50.030.

## Section 2
1. College in the high school is a dual credit program located on a high school campus or in a high school environment in which a high school student is able to earn both high school and college credit by completing college level courses with a passing grade. A college in the high school program must meet the accreditation requirements in RCW 28B.10.035 and the requirements in this section.

2. A college in the high school program may include both academic and career and technical education.

3. Ninth, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students, and students who have not yet received a high school diploma or its equivalent and are eligible to be in the ninth, 10th, 11th, or 12th grades, may participate in a college in the high school program.

4. A college in the high school program must be governed by a local contract between an institution of higher education and a school district, charter school, or state-tribal compact school, in compliance with the rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction under this section. The local contract must include the qualifications for students to enroll in a program course.

Enrollment information on persons registered under this section must be maintained by the institution of higher education separately from other enrollment information and may not be included in official enrollment reports, nor may such persons be considered in any enrollment statistics that would affect higher education budgetary determinations.

6. Each school district, charter school, and state-tribal compact school must award high school credit to a student enrolled in a program course if the student successfully completes the course. If no comparable course is offered by the school district, charter school, or state-tribal compact school, the chief administrator shall determine how many credits to award for the successful completion of the program course. The determination must be made in writing before the student enrolls in the program course. The awarded credit must be applied toward graduation requirements and subject area requirements. Evidence of successful completion of each program course must be included in the student's high school records and transcript.

7. An institution of higher education must award college credit to a student enrolled in a program course if the student successfully completes the course. The awarded college credit must be applied toward general education requirements or degree requirements at the institution of higher education. Evidence of successful completion of each program course must be included in the student's college transcript.

8. [Empty]

for high school credit or for students to enroll in a program course for both high school and college credit; and

        ii. A notification that enrolling in a program course for college credit automatically starts an official college transcript with the institution of higher education offering the program course regardless of student performance in the program course, and that college credit earned upon successful completion of a program course may count only as elective credit if transferred to another institution of higher education.

9. Full-time and part-time faculty at institutions of higher education, including adjunct faculty, are eligible to teach program courses.

10. The superintendent of public instruction shall adopt rules for the administration of this section. The rules must be jointly developed by the superintendent of public instruction, the state board for community and technical colleges, the student achievement council, and the public baccalaureate institutions. The association of Washington school principals must be consulted during the rules development. The rules must outline quality and eligibility standards that are informed by nationally recognized standards or models. In addition, the rules must encourage the maximum use of the program and may not narrow or limit the enrollment options.

13. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

    a. "Charter school" means a school established under chapter 28A.710 RCW.

    b. "High school" means a public school, as defined in RCW 28A.150.010, that serves students in any of grades nine through 12.
