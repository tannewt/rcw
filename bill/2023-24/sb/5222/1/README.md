## Section 1
1. The department shall oversee a network of volunteers who agree to participate in the "pick it up, Washington" program.

The department shall operate the program within existing resources.

2. The department shall advertise and promote the "pick it up, Washington" program and create and manage a list of pick it up volunteers who agree to participate. The department may reserve the right to exclude any individual from participating as a pick it up volunteer if the department determines that allowing such an individual to participate would create a risk to the health or safety of that individual, other volunteers, or the public.

3. The department may develop appropriate methods to give public recognition to the positive contributions of pick it up volunteers in their communities.

## Section 2

With respect to public places that are not private property, the department shall seek pick it up volunteers through the program created in section 1 of this act to remove litter that is not deposited in receptacles from these public places.
