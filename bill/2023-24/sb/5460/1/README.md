# SB 5460 - Irrigation & rehab districts

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5460.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the Moses Lake irrigation and rehabilitation district is the only district of its kind in Washington state. The district was recently involved in litigation in which the way it collected assessments was actually a tax. The legislature finds that it is necessary to align assessment authority with other local special improvement districts in order to provide local funding for improvements to local water quality.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. The directors

of the district shall annually determine the amount of money necessary to carry on the rehabilitation operations of the district and shall classify the property therein in proportion to the benefits to be derived from the rehabilitation operations of the district and in accordance with such classification shall apportion and assess the several lots, blocks, tracts, and parcels of land or other property within the district, which assessment shall be collected with the general taxes of the county or counties.

    b. A district may use the assessed valuation of property as a component in determining the district assessment of any class of lots, but when property has been designated as forestland, farm and agricultural land, or open space land under chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW, the district must use the assessed value applicable to forestland, farm and agricultural land, or open space land.

    c. If a district uses a fractional amount of assessed value as a component in determining the district assessment, then a fractional amount of the value applicable to forestland, farm and agricultural land, or open space land under chapter 84.33 or 84.34 RCW, if designated in the county tax records for the particular property, shall be used.

2. The district shall provide notice of the proposed assessments and hold an equalization hearing as provided for in chapter 87.03 RCW. The provisions of chapters 84.56 and 84.64 RCW and RCW 36.29.180 governing liens, collection, payment of assessments, delinquent assessments, interest and penalties, lien foreclosure, and foreclosed property shall govern such matters as applied.
