[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5530.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington residents would benefit from having a quick and seamless digital way to connect to public and private services. The legislature further finds that the work group created in this act will have the expertise and experience to bring together ideas for developing a "Whole WA" mobile application that may assist Washington residents in gaining access to a variety of existing services, such as social, behavioral health, and housing services. While many providers, both public and private, offer these types of services in Washington, the residents of our state do not always have an easy way to learn more about, and use, those services. It is the intent of the legislature that the work group created in this act will produce a plan for developing a "Whole WA" mobile application that will easily connect Washingtonians to the services they may need.

## Section 2

2. The purpose of the work group created in this section is to develop a plan and framework for launching a centralized technology platform and mobile application in order to transform Washington residents' digital experience with government and service providers by making public and private services and programs more accessible. The mobile application must be called "Whole WA." In developing the framework, the work group must:

    a. Recommend specific services or programs for inclusion in the technology platform and mobile application including, but not limited to, services related to children and families, financial assistance, driver services, behavioral health, recreation, public safety, housing, and substance use disorders;

    b. Discuss the technical requirements for providing Washington residents access to public and private services and programs through a centralized technology platform and mobile application and determine any requirements or limitations for consideration when integrating existing applications into a centralized technology platform or mobile application;

    c. Provide recommendations on how to effectively engage with state agencies and private service providers that may want to be included, such as nonprofit organizations, to launch services or programs on the technology platform and mobile application;

    d. Explore the features and specifications needed in order to make the technology platform and mobile application user-friendly;

    e. Reach out to other states that have launched or are working on similar centralized technology platforms or mobile applications in order to determine, learn, and share best practices;
