<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that current economic conditions, federal housing policies and declining resources at the federal, state, and local level adversely affect the ability of low and very low-income persons to obtain safe, decent, and affordable housing.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that members of over 150,000 households pay more than 50 percent of their income for rent and housing costs.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that minorities, rural households, and migrant farmworkers require housing assistance at a rate which significantly exceeds their proportion of the general population.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that one of the most dramatic housing needs is that of persons needing special housing-related services, such as individuals with mental illness, recovering alcoholics, frail elderly persons, families with members who have disabilities, and single parents. These services include medical assistance, counseling, chore services, and child care.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that state investments in affordable housing, as enabled by the legislature in 1986, have exceeded $1,800,000,000 to provide over 55,000 units of safe and affordable housing to low-income individuals.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department may forego the processes prescribed by RCW 47.28.050 and 47.12.283 and sell the real property to any of the following entities or persons at fair market value:</p>

If more than one abutting private owner requests in writing the right to purchase the property within 15 days after receiving notice of the proposed sale, the property shall be sold at public auction in the manner provided in RCW 47.12.283;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To any other owner of real property required for transportation purposes;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Sales to purchasers may, at the department's option, be for cash, by real estate contract, or exchange of land or highway improvements.

<p>Upon the joint request of a metropolitan park district, a city with a population of more than one hundred fifty thousand, and a county legislative authority in a county with a national park and a population of more than five hundred thousand and less than one million five hundred thousand, the county must submit an authorizing proposition to the county voters, fixing and imposing a sales and use tax in accordance with this chapter for the purposes designated in subsection (4) of this section and identified in the joint request. Such proposition must be placed on a ballot for a special or general election to be held no later than one year after the date of the joint request.</p>

<p>Properties subject to a memorandum of agreement between the federal bureau of land management, the advisory council on historic preservation, and the Washington state historic preservation officer have priority for funding from money received under subsection (6)(b) of this section for implementation of the stipulations in the memorandum of agreement.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At least one hundred thousand dollars of the first four years of allocations under subsection (6)(b) of this section, to be matched by the county or city with one dollar for every two dollars received, must be used to implement the stipulations of the memorandum of agreement and for other historical, archaeological, architectural, and cultural preservation and improvements related to the properties.</p>

<li>
<p>Payment of the tax imposed under this chapter is due and payable immediately at the time of sale, and if not paid within one month thereafter will bear interest from the time of sale until the date of payment.</p>

<li>
<p>Interest imposed before January 1, 1999, is computed at the rate of one percent per month.</p>

<p>If the tax imposed under this chapter is not received by the due date, the transferee is personally liable for the tax, along with any interest as provided in subsection (1) of this section, unless an instrument evidencing the sale is recorded in the official real property records of the county in which the property conveyed is located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If upon examination of any affidavits or from other information obtained by the department or its agents it appears that all or a portion of the tax is unpaid, the department must assess against the taxpayer the additional amount found to be due plus interest and penalties as provided in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The department must notify the taxpayer by mail, or electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.135, of the additional amount and the same becomes due and must be paid within thirty days from the date of the notice, or within such further time as the department may provide.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact by the taxpayer;</p>

<li>
<p>A failure by the taxpayer to record documentation of a sale or otherwise report the sale to the county treasurer; or</p>
