<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>As originally conceived and adopted in both the Untied States Constitution's second amendment and Article I, section 24 of the Washington state Constitution, the people of both our nation and state recognized the right to keep and bear arms to protect not just themselves, but also the state and federal governments from attack. The people enshrined this right in our constitutions not just for the purpose of self-defense, but also for the purpose of military readiness of the citizens in order to form militias, should they become necessary to defend our free state. As a result, the legislature finds that it is of the utmost importance that each state legislator demonstrate knowledge and familiarity with the safety, operation, and handling of firearms used for hunting, self-protection, and, should the need arise, defense of a free state.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

Proof of completion must be provided to the secretary of the senate or the chief clerk of the house of representatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section prohibits a legislator from completing training in addition to the requirements in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any legislator appointed to fill a vacancy who takes office after January 31st of the first year of a legislative biennium must comply with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section within 30 days of taking office.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
