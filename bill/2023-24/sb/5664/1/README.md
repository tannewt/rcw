        i. Private sector cultured aquatic salmon or salmon products as farm-raised salmon,  identifying whether any red dye is used, and the state, province, or foreign country where it was farm raised; or

        ii. Wild-caught salmon or salmon products as wild-caught salmon, identifying the species of salmon by its common name as defined in this title and the state, province, foreign country, or waterbody where it was commercially caught.

2. Identification of the products under subsection (1) of this section must be made to the buyer at the point of sale such that the buyer can make an informed purchasing decision for his or her protection, health, and safety.
