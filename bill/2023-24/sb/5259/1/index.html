<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the safety of our retail commerce and our retail workforce are threatened by increased product theft. Washington retailers are estimated to have lost $2,700,000,000 to organized retail crime in 2021. Federal crime statistics show that the number of assaults in retail establishments increased at a faster pace than the national average between 2018 and 2020. Washington's retail cannabis businesses reported increased armed robberies throughout 2022. These crimes endanger employees and cause substantial economic harm to our state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to establish an organized retail theft task force to improve coordination and collaboration among law enforcement agencies to address organized retail theft. It also intends to increase required safety measures in retail workplaces and protect retail workers from certain employment actions when product theft occurs at their workplace, with certain conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also intends to provide relief to retailers impacted by the cost of physical security improvements to prevent theft at cannabis retail establishments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

<li>
<p>The organized retail theft task force is established to improve coordination and collaboration among law enforcement agencies.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Staff support for the task force must be provided by the office of the attorney general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force must work with mercantile establishments and associations representing mercantile establishments on collecting and aggregating data on incidents of organized retail theft. Mercantile establishments that experience incidents of organized retail theft must report incidents to the task force.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task force must work with the liquor and cannabis board and their retail licensees to collect and aggregate data on significant incidents of theft, burglary, and robbery. Liquor and cannabis board retail licensees must report significant incidents of theft, burglary, and robbery to the task force.</p>

<p>Except for retailers that qualify for the tax rate under (b) of this subsection, there is levied and collected a cannabis excise tax equal to thirty-seven percent of the selling price on each retail sale in this state of cannabis concentrates, useable cannabis, and cannabis-infused products. This tax is separate and in addition to general state and local sales and use taxes that apply to retail sales of tangible personal property, and is not part of the total retail price to which general state and local sales and use taxes apply. The tax must be separately itemized from the state and local retail sales tax on the sales receipt provided to the buyer.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The cannabis excise tax established in (a) of this subsection is 32 percent for cannabis retailers that spend $3,000 or more for physical security improvements to prevent theft at any single cannabis retail establishment in a calendar year. The reduced rate begins the month after the $3,000 threshold is met and expires after 12 months. The reduced tax rate established in this section only applies to cannabis retail stores at which the physical security improvements were implemented. The reduced tax may be applied to multiple cannabis retail stores owned by the same person if the $3,000 threshold is met at each individual retail store. The reduced tax rate established in this subsection (1)(b)(i) may only be claimed once for each cannabis retail establishment.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this subsection (1)(b), &quot;physical security improvements&quot; may include, but are not limited to: Security cameras, antitheft mirrors, antitheft signage, merchandising security equipment such as secure stands or mounts, locking display cases or display locks, electronic article surveillance, and storefront crash barriers or safety bollards.</p>

If any seller fails to collect the tax imposed in this section or, having collected the tax, fails to pay it as prescribed by the board, whether such failure is the result of the seller's own acts or the result of acts or conditions beyond the seller's control, the seller is, nevertheless, personally liable to the state for the amount of the tax.</p>
