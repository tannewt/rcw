<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that emissions from watercraft fuels supplied in Washington that are combusted outside of Washington, and motor vehicle fuel or special fuel that is used exclusively for agricultural purposes by a farm fuel user, are exempt from coverage under chapter 70A.65 RCW, commonly known as the Washington climate commitment act. However, the legislature further finds that the intended effect of these exemptions may not be reflected in the prices end users are paying for these exempt fuels due to the compliance obligation imposed by the Washington climate commitment act. The legislature determines that it is in the public interest to develop a process to ensure that end users of exempt fuels in Washington's essential maritime and agriculture sectors will not experience price impacts caused by the Washington climate commitment act, and that it is appropriate to reimburse exempt fuel users for fuel costs they have borne under the Washington climate commitment act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) It is the intent of the legislature that each year the total investments made through the carbon emissions reduction account created in RCW 70A.65.240, the climate commitment account created in RCW 70A.65.260, the natural climate solutions account created in RCW 70A.65.270, the air quality and health disparities improvement account created in RCW 70A.65.280, the climate transit programs account created in RCW 46.68.500, and the climate active transportation account created in RCW 46.68.490, achieve the following:</p>
