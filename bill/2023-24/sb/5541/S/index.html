<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there is a need to ensure that large retailers and manufacturers provide consumers with information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct operations and supply chains, educate consumers on how to purchase goods produced by companies that responsibly manage their supply chains, and, thereby, contribute towards the reduction and eradication of all forms of modern slavery and human trafficking.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that in order to provide consumers with this critical information and to allow consumers to make more educated purchasing decisions, it is necessary to post information by companies that meet certain criteria to ensure they are disclosing their efforts to help eradicate human trafficking and slavery within their supply chains on their website or through written disclosures.</p>
<p>The legislature finally finds, absent publicly available disclosures, consumers are at a disadvantage in being able to distinguish companies on the merits of their efforts to supply products free from the taint of slavery and trafficking and that consumers and businesses may inadvertently promote and sanction these crimes through the purchase of goods and products that have been tainted in the supply chain.</p>
