## Section 4
1. Whenever a worker has a previous bodily disability from any previous injury or disease, whether known or unknown to the employer, and suffers a further disability from injury or occupational disease in employment covered by this title and becomes totally and permanently disabled from the combined effects thereof or dies when death was substantially accelerated by the combined effects thereof, then the experience record of an employer insured with the state fund at the time of the further injury or disease must be charged and a self-insured employer must pay directly into the self-insurance reserve fund only the accident cost which would have resulted solely from the further injury or disease, had there been no preexisting disability, and which accident cost must be based upon an evaluation of the disability by medical experts. The difference between the charge thus assessed to such employer at the time of the further injury or disease and the total cost of the pension reserve must be assessed against the second injury fund. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the department must pass upon the application of this section in all cases where benefits are paid for total permanent disability or death and issue an order thereon appealable by the employer. Pending outcome of such appeal the transfer or payment must be made as required by such order.

2. If a self-insured employer is in default or the director has withdrawn the certification of a self-insured employer, the department may not pass on the application of this section. In such cases, the total cost of the pension reserve must first be assessed against the defaulting self-insured employer's deposit required by RCW 51.14.020 and in cases where the surety funds are insufficient the remaining cost of the pension reserve must be assessed against the insolvency trust fund.

3. The department must, in cases of claims of workers sustaining injuries or occupational diseases in the employ of state fund employers, recompute the experience record of such employers when the claims of workers injured in their employ have been found to qualify for payments from the second injury fund after the regular time for computation of such experience records and the department may make appropriate adjustments in such cases including cash refunds or credits to such employers.

4. To encourage employment of injured workers who have a developmental disability as defined in RCW 71A.10.020, the department may adopt rules providing for the reduction or elimination of premiums or assessments from employers of such workers and may also adopt rules for the reduction or elimination of charges against their employers in the event of further injury to such workers in their employ.

## Section 5
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, each self-insured employer shall retain from the earnings of each of its workers that amount as shall be fixed from time to time by the director, the basis for measuring said amount to be determined by the director. These moneys shall only be retained from employees and remitted to the department in such manner and at such intervals as the department directs and shall be placed in the self-insured employer overpayment reimbursement fund. The moneys so collected shall be used exclusively for reimbursement to the self-insurance reserve fund and to self-insured employers for benefits overpaid during the pendency of board or court appeals in which the self-insured employer prevails and has not recovered, and shall be no more than necessary to make such payments on a current basis.

2. None of the amount assessed for the employer overpayment reimbursement fund under this section may be retained from the earnings of workers covered under RCW 51.16.210.

## Section 6
For every case resulting in death or permanent total disability the department shall transfer on its books from the accident fund of the proper class and/or appropriate account to the "reserve fund" a sum of money for that case equal to the estimated present cash value of the monthly payments provided for it, to be calculated upon the basis of an annuity covering the payments in this title provided to be made for the case. Such annuity values shall be based upon rates of mortality, disability, remarriage, and interest as determined by the department, taking into account the experience of the reserve fund and self-insurance reserve fund in such respects.

## Section 7
1. For every case resulting in death or permanent total disability, a self-insurer in these circumstances shall pay into the self-insurance reserve fund a sum of money for that case equal to the estimated present cash value of the monthly payments provided for it, to be calculated upon the basis of an annuity covering the payments in this title provided to be made for the case. Such annuity values shall be based upon rates of mortality, disability, remarriage, and interest as determined by the department, taking into account the experience of the reserve fund and self-insurance reserve fund in such respects.

2. As an alternative to payment procedures otherwise provided under law, in the event of death or permanent total disability to workers of self-insured employers, a self-insured employer may upon establishment of such obligation file with the department a bond, an assignment of account from a federally or state chartered commercial banking institution authorized to conduct business in the state of Washington, or purchase an annuity, in an amount deemed by the department to be reasonably sufficient to insure payment of the pension benefits provided by law. Any purchase of an annuity shall be from an institution meeting the following minimum requirements: (a) The institution must be rated no less than "A+" by A.M. Best, and no less than "AA" by Moody's and by Standard & Poor's; (b) the value of the assets of the institution must not be less than ten billion dollars; (c) not more than ten percent of the institution's assets may include bonds that are rated less than "BBB" by Moody's and Standard & Poor's; (d) not more than five percent of the assets may be held as equity in real estate; and (e) not more than twenty-five percent of the assets may be first mortgages, and not more than five percent may be second mortgages. The department shall adopt rules governing assignments of account and annuities. Such rules shall ensure that the funds are available if needed, even in the case of failure of the banking institution, the institution authorized to provide annuities, or the employer's business.

The annuity value for every such case shall be determined by the department based upon the department's experience as to rates of mortality, disability, remarriage, and interest. The amount of the required bond, assignment of account, or annuity may be reviewed and adjusted periodically by the department, based upon periodic redeterminations by the department as to the outstanding annuity value for the case.

Under such an alternative, the department shall administer the payment of this obligation to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. The department shall be reimbursed for all such payments from the self-insured employer through periodic charges not less than quarterly in a manner to be determined by the director. The self-insured employer shall additionally pay to the department a deposit equal to the first three months' payments otherwise required under RCW 51.32.050 and 51.32.060. Such deposit shall be placed in the self-insurance reserve fund in accordance with RCW 51.44.140 and shall be returned to the respective self-insured employer when monthly payments are no longer required for such particular obligation.

If a self-insurer delays or refuses to reimburse the department beyond fifteen days after the reimbursement charges become due, there shall be a penalty paid by the self-insurer upon order of the director of an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent of the amount then due which shall be paid into the self-insurance reserve fund. Such an order shall conform to the requirements of RCW 51.52.050.

## Section 8
The department shall notify the state treasurer from time to time, of  transfers as a whole from the state fund to the reserve fund and from self-insured employers to the self-insurance reserve fund and the interest or other earnings of the reserve fund shall become a part of the reserve fund itself. Interest or other earnings of the self-insurance reserve fund shall become a part of the self-insurance reserve fund itself. As soon as possible after June 30th of each year the department shall expert the reserve fund and self-insurance reserve fund separately to ascertain the standing of the funds as of June 30th of that year and the relation of the outstanding annuities at their then value to the cash on hand or at interest belonging to the funds. The department shall promptly report the result of the examinations to the state treasurer in writing not later than September 30th following. If the report shows that there was on said June 30th, in the reserve fund or self-insurance reserve fund in cash or at interest, a greater sum than the then annuity value of the outstanding pension obligations, the surplus in the reserve fund shall be forthwith turned over to the state fund and the surplus in the self-insurance reserve fund shall be forthwith turned over to the appropriate self-insured employer accounts under RCW 51.44.140 but, if the report shows the contrary condition , the deficiency of the reserve fund shall be forthwith made good out of the state fund and the deficiency in the self-insurance fund shall be made good from the appropriate self-insured employer accounts under RCW 51.44.140.

## Section 9
Whenever, in the judgment of the state investment board, there shall be in the accident fund, medical aid fund, reserve fund, self-insurance reserve fund, industrial insurance rainy day fund, or the supplemental pension fund, funds in excess of that amount deemed by the state investment board to be sufficient to meet the current expenditures properly payable therefrom, the state investment board may invest and reinvest such excess funds in the manner prescribed by RCW 43.84.150, and not otherwise.

The state investment board may give consideration to the investment of excess funds in federally insured student loans made to persons in vocational training or retraining or reeducation programs. The state investment board may make such investments by purchasing from savings and loan associations, commercial banks, mutual savings banks, credit unions and other institutions authorized to be lenders under the federally insured student loan act, organized under federal or state law and operating in this state loans made by such institutions to residents of the state of Washington particularly for the purpose of vocational training or reeducation: PROVIDED, That the state investment board shall purchase only that portion of any loan which is guaranteed or insured by the United States of America, or by any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America: PROVIDED FURTHER, That the state investment board is authorized to enter into contracts with such savings and loan associations, commercial banks, mutual savings banks, credit unions, and other institutions authorized to be lenders under the federally insured student loan act to service loans purchased pursuant to this section at an agreed upon contract price.

        iii. A statement of actuarial opinion on whether the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the accident, medical aid, and pension reserve funds were prepared in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles.
