    a.

The real estate and property tax administration assistance account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. An appropriation is not required for expenditures and the account is not subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW.

    b. Beginning January 1, 2024, the county treasurer must  collect an additional $7.05 fee , as adjusted under (d) of this subsection (3), on all transactions required by this chapter, regardless of whether the transaction requires the payment of tax. The county treasurer shall deposit one-half of this fee in the special real estate and property tax administration assistance account in accordance with (c) of this subsection and remit the balance to the state treasurer at the same time the county treasurer remits funds to the state under subsection (1) of this section. The state treasurer must place money from this fee in the real estate and property tax administration assistance account. By the 20th day of the subsequent month, the state treasurer must distribute the funds to each county treasurer according to the following formula: One-half of the funds available must be equally distributed among the 39 counties; and the balance must be ratably distributed among the counties in direct proportion to their population as it relates to the total state's population based on most recent statistics by the office of financial management.

    c. When received by the county treasurer, the funds must be placed in a special real estate and property tax administration assistance account held by the county treasurer to be used for:

        i. Maintenance and operation of an annual revaluation system for property tax valuation; and

        ii. Maintenance and operation of an electronic processing and reporting system for real estate excise tax affidavits.

    d. Beginning in fiscal year 2027, and every fourth year thereafter, the department must adjust the fee amount under (b) of this subsection (3) to reflect the growth of the consumer price index. The department must publish the updated fee by September 1, 2026, and September 1st of every fourth year thereafter. The updated fee amount applies beginning January 1, 2027, and January 1st every fourth year thereafter. An adjusted fee amount must be rounded to the nearest five cents. No changes may be made to an adjusted fee amount once such adjustment takes effect. The most recent fee amount becomes the base for subsequent adjustments. For purposes of this subsection, "consumer price index" means the most current seasonally adjusted index for the shelter expenditure category of the consumer price index for all urban consumers as published by July 31st by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor.
