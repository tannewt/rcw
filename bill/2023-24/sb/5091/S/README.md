[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5091-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2, 3, and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 2, 3, and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, improve industry competitiveness, and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a), (b), and (c).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage hydrogen fuel product research, development, and manufacture in Washington, and to increase the number and wage level of jobs in this industry.

4. The joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate:

    a. The number of businesses and employees in this state focused on hydrogen fuel product research, development, or manufacture, including examination of employee wages and benefits;

    b. Whether Washington businesses focused on hydrogen fuel product research, development, and manufacturing in the state have made advancements in hydrogen fuel product technology, which may include examination of the number of patents filed with the United States patent and trademark office, research and development spending, products delivered to market, and any other metrics deemed relevant by the committee; and

    c. Business and employment changes in hydrogen fuel product research, development, and manufacture in Washington compared with national changes in the industry.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may access and use any relevant data collected by the state, including information contained on the annual tax performance reports and excise tax data submitted to the department of revenue and employment and wage data submitted to the employment security department.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. Beginning January 1, 2024, upon every person engaging within this state in the business of manufacturing hydrogen fuel products, as to such persons the amount of tax with respect to such business is, in the case of manufacturers, equal to the value of the product manufactured, or in the case of processors for hire, equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate of 0.2904 percent.

    b. Beginning January 1, 2024, upon every person engaging within this state in the business of making sales, at retail or wholesale, of hydrogen fuel products manufactured by the seller, as to such persons the amount of tax with respect to such business is equal to the gross proceeds of sales, multiplied by the rate of 0.2904 percent.

2. The preferential tax rate authorized under this section applies only to persons compensating workers at prevailing wage rates determined by local collective bargaining as determined by the department of labor and industries. This subsection applies only to job classifications where prevailing wage rates are available.

3. For purposes of this section, the definitions in this subsection apply.

    a. "Hydrogen" means green electrolytic hydrogen, as defined in RCW 82.89.010.

    b. "Hydrogen electrolyzer" means a technology that uses an electrochemical reaction to generate hydrogen by combining water and electricity in the presence of a catalyst.

    d. "Hydrogen fuel product" means a hydrogen fuel cell or a hydrogen electrolyzer.

4. This section expires January 1, 2035.

## Section 3
1. In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed for each person for qualified hydrogen fuel product development. For a person who is a manufacturer or processor for hire of hydrogen fuel products, credit may be earned for expenditures occurring after January 1, 2024.

2. The credit is equal to the amount of qualified hydrogen fuel product development expenditures of a person, multiplied by the rate of 1.75 percent.

3. The credit under this section must be claimed against taxes due for the same calendar year in which the qualified hydrogen fuel product development expenditures are incurred. The credit for each calendar year may not exceed the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter for the calendar year. Refunds may not be granted in the place of a credit.

4. Any person claiming the credit must file an electronic form prescribed by the department that includes the amount of the credit claimed, an estimate of the anticipated hydrogen fuel product development expenditures during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, an estimate of the taxable amount during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, and such additional information as the department may prescribe. A person whose reporting period is less than annual must make an adjustment to the total credit claimed for the calendar year using the person's actual hydrogen fuel product development expenditures for the calendar year when the person files its last return for the calendar year for which the credit is claimed.

5. The credit authorized under this section may only be claimed by persons compensating each employee engaged in qualified hydrogen fuel product development at an annualized amount equal to or greater than 125 percent of the per capita personal income of the county from which the employee performs a majority of the employee's employment activity.

6. Credits are available on a first-in-time basis. The department must disallow any credits, or portion thereof, that would cause the total amount of credits claimed under this section during any calendar year to exceed $3,000,000. If this limitation is reached, the department must notify all persons claiming the credit that the annual statewide limit has been met. In addition, the department must provide written notice to any person who has claimed tax credits in excess of the limitation in this subsection. The notice must indicate the amount of tax due and provide that the tax be paid within 30 days from the date of the notice. The department may not assess penalties and interest as provided in chapter 82.32 RCW on the amount due in the initial notice if the amount due is paid by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof.
