# SB 5091 - Hydrogen fuel cells

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5091.pdf)

## Section 1
. (1) This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2, 3, and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 2, 3, and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, improve industry competitiveness, and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a), (b), and (c).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage hydrogen fuel cell research, development, manufacture, and sale in Washington to advance hydrogen fuel cell technology, production, and adoption in the state.

4. If a review finds that the number of businesses in this state focused on hydrogen fuel cell research, development, manufacture, or sale has increased as measured by the number of businesses claiming the tax preferences in this act, or that Washington businesses focused on hydrogen fuel cell research, development, and manufacturing in the state have made advancements in hydrogen fuel cell technology, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of these tax preferences.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may access and use any relevant data collected by the state.

## Section 2
1. Beginning October 1, 2023, upon every person engaging within this state in the business of manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells, or making sales, at retail or wholesale, of hydrogen fuel cells, as to such persons the amount of tax with respect to such business is, in the case of manufacturers, equal to the value of the product manufactured and the gross proceeds of sales of the product manufactured, or in the case of processors for hire, equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate of 0.2904 percent.

2. For purposes of this section, "hydrogen fuel cell" means a technology that uses an electrochemical reaction to generate electric energy by combining atoms of hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst.

3. This section expires January 1, 2034.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed for each person for qualified hydrogen fuel cell development. For a person who is a manufacturer or processor for hire of hydrogen fuel cells, credit may be earned for expenditures occurring after July 1, 2023.

    b. Any unused credits earned under this section may be accrued and carried forward.

2. The credit is equal to the amount of qualified hydrogen fuel cell development expenditures of a person, multiplied by the rate of 1.75 percent.

3. Except as provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section, the credit under this section must be claimed against taxes due for the same calendar year in which the qualified hydrogen fuel cell development expenditures are incurred. The credit for each calendar year may not exceed the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter for the calendar year. Refunds may not be granted in the place of a credit.

4. Any person claiming the credit must file an electronic form prescribed by the department that includes the amount of the credit claimed, an estimate of the anticipated hydrogen fuel cell development expenditures during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, an estimate of the taxable amount during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, and such additional information as the department may prescribe.

5. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

    a. "Hydrogen fuel cell" has the same meaning as provided in section 2 of this act.

    b. [Empty]

        i. "Hydrogen fuel cell development" means:

(A) Research, design, and engineering activities performed in relation to the development of hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen fuel cell technology, or of a product line of a hydrogen fuel cell, including prototype development, testing, and certification;

(B) The discovery of technological information, the translating of technological information into new or improved products, processes, techniques, formulas, or inventions, and the adaptation of existing products into new products; and

(C) Tool design and engineering design for the manufacturing process.

        ii. "Hydrogen fuel cell development" does not include:

(A) Surveys and studies, social science and humanities research, market research or testing, quality control, sale promotion and service, computer software developed for internal use, and research in peripheral areas; or

(B) Manufacturing activities or other production-oriented activities.

    c. "Qualified hydrogen fuel cell development" means hydrogen fuel cell development performed within this state.

    d. [Empty]

        i. "Qualified hydrogen fuel cell development expenditures" means operating expenses, including wages, compensation of a proprietor or a partner in a partnership as determined by the department, benefits, supplies, and computer expenses, directly incurred in qualified hydrogen fuel cell development by a person claiming the credit provided in this section.

        ii. "Qualified hydrogen fuel cell development expenditures" does not include amounts paid to a person or to the state and any of its departments and institutions, other than a public educational or research institution to conduct qualified hydrogen fuel cell development; or capital costs and overhead, such as expenses for land, structures, or depreciable property.

    e. "Taxable amount" means the taxable amount subject to the tax imposed in this chapter required to be reported on the person's tax returns during the year in which the credit is claimed, less any taxable amount for which a credit is allowed under RCW 82.04.440.

2. The credit is equal to:

    a. [Empty]

        i.(A) Property taxes paid on buildings, and land upon which the buildings are located, constructed after July 1, 2023, and used exclusively in manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells; and

(B) Leasehold excise taxes paid with respect to buildings constructed after July 1, 2023, the land upon which the buildings are located, or both, if the buildings are used exclusively in manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells; or

        ii. Property taxes attributable to an increase in assessed value due to the renovation or expansion of a building used exclusively in manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells; and

    b. [Empty]

        i. An amount equal to property taxes paid, by persons taxable under section 2 of this act, on machinery and equipment exempt under RCW 82.08.02565 or 82.12.02565 and acquired after July 1, 2023;

(A) The numerator of the fraction is the total taxable amount subject to the tax imposed under section 2 of this act on the applicable business activities of manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells.

(B) The denominator of the fraction is the total taxable amount subject to the tax imposed under all manufacturing classifications in this chapter.

(C) For purposes of both the numerator and denominator of the fraction, the total taxable amount refers to the total taxable amount required to be reported on the person's returns for the calendar year before the calendar year in which the credit under this section is earned. The department may provide for an alternative method for calculating the numerator in cases where the tax rate provided in section 2 of this act for manufacturing was not in effect during the full calendar year before the calendar year in which the credit under this section is earned.

(D) No credit is available under this subsection (2)(b) if either the numerator or the denominator of the fraction is zero. If the fraction is greater than or equal to 0.9, then the fraction is rounded to one.
