<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>. (1) This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2, 3, and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 2, 3, and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, improve industry competitiveness, and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a), (b), and (c).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage hydrogen fuel cell research, development, manufacture, and sale in Washington to advance hydrogen fuel cell technology, production, and adoption in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a review finds that the number of businesses in this state focused on hydrogen fuel cell research, development, manufacture, or sale has increased as measured by the number of businesses claiming the tax preferences in this act, or that Washington businesses focused on hydrogen fuel cell research, development, and manufacturing in the state have made advancements in hydrogen fuel cell technology, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of these tax preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may access and use any relevant data collected by the state.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning October 1, 2023, upon every person engaging within this state in the business of manufacturing hydrogen fuel cells, or making sales, at retail or wholesale, of hydrogen fuel cells, as to such persons the amount of tax with respect to such business is, in the case of manufacturers, equal to the value of the product manufactured and the gross proceeds of sales of the product manufactured, or in the case of processors for hire, equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate of 0.2904 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;hydrogen fuel cell&quot; means a technology that uses an electrochemical reaction to generate electric energy by combining atoms of hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst.</p>

<li>
<p>Any person claiming the credit must file an electronic form prescribed by the department that includes the amount of the credit claimed, an estimate of the anticipated hydrogen fuel cell development expenditures during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, an estimate of the taxable amount during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, and such additional information as the department may prescribe.</p>
