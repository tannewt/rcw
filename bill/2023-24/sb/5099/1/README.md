## Section 1
The legislature finds that individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities who reside in community settings are best served by a broad array of services that support independent living. Although the establishment of the developmental disabilities community services account provides a mechanism with which to provide that support, a lack of reliable revenue sources has proven to be a barrier to achieving this goal. As a result, the legislature intends to establish a permanent funding source for this account in order to provide ongoing services and supports to assist individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live as independently as possible in the least restrictive environment.

## Section 2
(1) The education legacy trust account is created in the state treasury. Money in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, expenditures from the account may be used only for support of the common schools, and for expanding access to higher education through funding for new enrollments and financial aid, early learning and child care programs, and other educational improvement efforts.
