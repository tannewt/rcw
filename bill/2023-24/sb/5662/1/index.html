<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washington voters legalized recreational cannabis just 10 years ago through the passage of Initiative Measure No. 502, and in many ways the industry is still nascent. The state has taken modest steps to ensure better equity in the industry to mitigate harms done to communities that were disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs, but the state still has more work to do. Studies by respected industry publications state that a majority of frontline cannabis workers are women and people of color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The liquor and cannabis board sets the number of licenses and manages the process when a retail establishment changes their licensure status through a change in ownership or a change in business location. Of the 463 active retail licenses, 143 (31 percent) have undergone some kind of change in ownership, many of them more than once. This high turnover in ownership fosters job insecurity in what is already a challenging industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that, given the uniqueness of an industry where the number of retail licenses are fixed by statute, where jobs are limited to those establishments with a state license, and where the ownership of those licenses has a high degree of turnover, it is necessary to ensure job retention in a continually changing industry.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>The department shall create and make available a poster that gives notice of the rights afforded by this chapter. The department shall create the poster in English, Spanish, and other languages the department determines is appropriate. The poster must give notice of:</p>

<p>Employers shall display the poster in a conspicuous and accessible place at every workplace or jobsite where any of their employees work. Employers shall display the poster in English and in the primary language of the employee(s) at the particular workplace. Employers shall make a good faith effort to determine the primary languages of the employees at that particular workplace. If display of the poster is not feasible, including situations when the employee works remotely or does not have a regular workplace or jobsite, employers may provide the poster on an individual basis in an employee's primary language in physical or electronic format that is reasonably conspicuous and accessible.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An employer or any other person may not interfere with, restrain, deny, or attempt to deny the exercise of any right protected under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer or any other person may not take any adverse action against any person because the person has exercised in good faith the rights protected under this section. Rights protected under this section include but are not limited to the right to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Make inquiries about protected rights under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform others about their rights under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform the person's employer, the person's legal counsel, a union or similar organization, or any other person about an alleged violation of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File an oral or written complaint with the department or bring a civil action for an alleged violation of this chapter;</p>

<li>
<p>Cooperate with the department in its investigations of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testify in a proceeding under or related to this chapter;</p>

<p>Refuse to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of city, state, or federal law; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oppose any policy, practice, or act that is unlawful under this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employer or any other person may not communicate to a person exercising rights protected in this section, directly or indirectly, the willingness to inform a government employee or contracted organization that the person is not lawfully in the United States, or to report, or to make an implied or express assertion of a willingness to report, suspected citizenship or immigration status of an employee or a family member of the employee to a federal, state, or local agency, because the employee has exercised a right under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if the employer or any other person takes an adverse action against a person within 90 days of the person's exercise of rights protected in this section. However, in the case of seasonal employment that ended before the close of the 90-calendar day period, the presumption also applies if the employer fails to rehire a former employee at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The employer may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was taken for a permissible purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of retaliation under this section is sufficient upon a showing that the employer or any other person has taken an adverse action against a person and the person's exercise of rights protected in this section was a motivating factor in the adverse action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such protected activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The protections under this section apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith alleges violations of this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>A complaint or other communication by any person to the department triggers the protections of this section regardless of whether the complaint or communication is in writing or makes explicit reference to this chapter.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Assess a daily amount for unpaid compensation in a minimum amount of $150 for each day that each violation occurred or continued.
