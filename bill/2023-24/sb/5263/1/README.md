    e. Establish or facilitate the provision of scholarship funding for psilocybin service facilitator training; and

    f. If applicable, create eligibility for social opportunity applicants to receive points towards a license application score.

For the purposes of this subsection, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

18. The procuring, or aiding or abetting in procuring, a criminal abortion;

19. The offering, undertaking, or agreeing to cure or treat disease by a secret method, procedure, treatment, or medicine, or the treating, operating, or prescribing for any health condition by a method, means, or procedure which the licensee refuses to divulge upon demand of the disciplining authority;
