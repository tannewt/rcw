<p>In every case originating in or removed to a court of competent jurisdiction, in which different liens are claimed against the same property, the court, in the judgment, must declare the rank of such lien or class of liens, which shall be in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All persons performing labor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All persons furnishing material;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And the proceeds of the sale of the property must be applied to each lien or class of liens in the order of its rank; and personal judgment may be rendered in an action brought to foreclose a lien, against any party personally liable for any debt for which the lien is claimed, and if the lien be established, the judgment shall provide for the enforcement thereof upon the property liable as in case of foreclosure of mortgages; and the amount realized by such enforcement of the lien shall be credited upon the proper personal judgment, and the deficiency, if any, remaining unsatisfied, shall stand as a personal judgment, and may be collected by execution against the party liable therefor. The court may allow, as part of the costs of the action, the moneys paid for filing or recording the claim, and a reasonable attorney's fee in the action.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Any owner of property subject to a recorded claim of lien under this chapter, or contractor, subcontractor, lender, or lien claimant who believes the claim of lien to be frivolous and made without reasonable cause, or clearly excessive may apply by motion to the superior court for the county where the property is located, for an order directing the lien claimant to appear before the court at a time no earlier than six nor later than fifteen days following the date of service of the application and order on the lien claimant, and show cause, if any he or she has, why the relief requested should not be granted. The motion shall state the grounds upon which relief is asked, and shall be supported by the affidavit of the applicant or his or her attorney setting forth a concise statement of the facts upon which the motion is based.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order shall clearly state that if the lien claimant fails to appear at the time and place noted the lien shall be released, with prejudice, and that the lien claimant shall be ordered to pay the costs requested by the applicant including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no action to foreclose the lien claim has been filed, the clerk of the court shall assign a cause number to the application and obtain from the applicant a filing fee of thirty-five dollars. If an action has been filed to foreclose the lien claim, the application shall be made a part of that action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant must give notice of the hearing to the lien claimant by providing copies of the motion, order, and any other documents filed with the court, to the lien claimant by first-class mail, by certified or registered mail, or by personal service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, following a hearing on the matter, the court determines that the lien is frivolous and made without reasonable cause, or clearly excessive, the court shall issue an order releasing the lien if frivolous and made without reasonable cause, or reducing the lien if clearly excessive, and awarding costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the applicant to be paid by the lien claimant. If the court determines that the lien is not frivolous and was made with reasonable cause, and is not clearly excessive, the court shall issue an order so stating and awarding costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the lien claimant to be paid by the applicant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proceedings under this section shall not affect other rights and remedies available to the parties under this chapter or otherwise.</p>
