<p>Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an action to foreclose a wage lien may not be commenced more than eight months after the date the wage lien was recorded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the claimant has instituted an action in a court of this state for the wage claim that is the subject of the wage lien, and that court is the court authorized by subsection (1) of this section to foreclose on the lien, that action shall be deemed an action to foreclose on the property subject to the lien.</p>

<li>
<p>If the claimant receives a judgment on a wage claim from a federal, state, or municipal court, that is not authorized to adjudicate the foreclosure of the claimant's wage lien, a separate action to foreclose the wage lien must be filed within 90 days of the date of that court's judgment.

<p>A final and binding assessment of wages owed by the department or by any local agency with authority to adjudicate wage claims, in addition to any applicable postjudgment interest, establishes the amount owed for the purposes of foreclosure under this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>A wage lien may also be foreclosed by:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The department using the department's collection procedures under RCW 49.48.086 when the claimant has pursued a wage claim in an administrative proceeding and a final and binding citation and notice of assessment has been issued;</p>

<p>The foreclosure pursuant to this subsection by the claimant of a wage lien affecting real property must be commenced by the filing of an action in superior court in the county where the real property is located within 90 days of the date the department's citation and notice of assessment becomes final and binding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extinguishment of a wage lien pursuant to RCW 60.90.090 does not preclude the department from using the collection procedures under RCW 49.48.086.</p>

<p>A foreclosure action may be brought by the employee individually, the department, an administrative agency of a local government, the United States department of labor, the office of the attorney general, or a representative of the employee, including a collective bargaining representative or class representative. Multiple wage claims against the same employer may be joined in a single proceeding, but the court may order separate trials or hearings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the judgment resulting from an action to foreclose on the wage lien, the court may order the sale at sheriff's auction or the transfer to the lien claimant of title or possession of any property subject to the wage lien. Whether or not the court makes such an order as part of the judgment, a writ of sale may be issued for any property subject to the wage lien for 10 years after a judgment for a wage claim is issued. A wage lien based on an underlying judgment continues in force for an additional 10-year period if the period of execution for the underlying judgment is extended under RCW 6.17.020.</p>

<li>
<p>In an action to foreclose on a wage lien on titled goods, the lien claimant must comply with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section and any other requirements of the department of licensing regarding transferring title and taking ownership of the vehicle or vessel.</p>

<p>A lien claimant who prevails in a foreclosure action is entitled to costs, including the cost of recording or filing the lien and costs of title reports, and reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

<p>A lien under this chapter may be foreclosed and enforced as provided under RCW 60.90.070. The court shall have the power to order the sale of the property. In any action brought to foreclose a lien, the owner shall be joined as a party. The interest in the property of any person who, prior to the commencement of the action, has a recorded interest in the property, or any part thereof, shall not be foreclosed or affected unless they are joined as a party.</p>

<p>A person shall not begin an action to foreclose a lien upon any property while a prior action begun to foreclose another lien on the same property is pending, but if not made a party plaintiff or defendant to the prior action, he or she may apply to the court to be joined as a party thereto, and his or her lien may be foreclosed in the same action. The filing of such application shall toll the running of the period of limitation until disposition of the application or other time set by the court.</p>

<p>The court shall grant the application for joinder unless to do so would create an undue delay or cause hardship which cannot be cured by the imposition of costs or other conditions as the court deems just.</p>

<p>If a lien foreclosure action is filed during the pendency of another such action, the court may, on its own motion or the motion of any party, consolidate actions upon such terms and conditions as the court deems just, unless to do so would create an undue delay or cause hardship which cannot be cured by the imposition of costs or other conditions. If consolidation of actions is not permissible under this chapter, the lien foreclosure action filed during the pendency of another such action shall not be dismissed if the filing was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, or irregularity. An action to foreclose a lien shall not be dismissed at the instance of a plaintiff therein to the prejudice of another party to the suit who claims a lien.</p>

<p>For a lien on real property, the bond must be recorded in the office of the county recorder or auditor in the county where the claim of lien was recorded.

<p>For a lien on personal property, within five days of furnishing a bond, the person furnishing the bond shall send notice to the lien claimant, by certified mail return receipt requested, notifying the lien claimant that a bond meeting the requirements of this section has been furnished. The notification must include sufficient documentation or other evidence showing that a bond meeting the requirements of this section has been furnished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 15 days of receiving notice that a bond has been purchased, the lien claimant shall release the lien pursuant to RCW 60.90.090. If a lien claimant fails to release the wage lien as required, upon demand and 15 days' notice by the employer or any affected party, mailed to the lien claimant's address as indicated on the notice of the wage lien by certified mail with return receipt requested, the employer or affected party may petition the court in which foreclosure is authorized under RCW 60.90.070, for an order releasing the wage lien. If the lien claimant acted unreasonably and in bad faith in refusing to file a release of the wage lien, the employer or affected party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the action, and the court in its discretion may also issue a fine not to exceed $1,000.</p>
