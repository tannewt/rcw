<p>Except as provided in RCW 31.45.020, no check casher or seller may engage in business without first obtaining a license from the director in accordance with this chapter. A license is required for each location where a licensee engages in the business of cashing or selling checks or drafts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each application for a license shall be in writing in a form prescribed by the director and shall contain the following information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The legal name, residence, and business address of the applicant and, if the applicant is a partnership, association, or corporation, of every member, officer, and director thereof;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The application shall be filed together with an investigation and supervision fee established by rule by the director. Such fees collected shall be deposited to the credit of the financial services regulation fund in accordance with RCW 43.320.110.</p>

<p>Before granting a license to sell checks, drafts, or money orders under this chapter, the director shall require that the licensee file with the director a surety bond running to the state of Washington, which bond shall be issued by a surety insurer which meets the requirements of chapter 48.28 RCW, and be in a format acceptable to the director. The director shall adopt rules to determine the penal sum of the bond that shall be filed by each licensee. The bond shall be conditioned upon the licensee paying all persons who purchase checks, drafts, or money orders from the licensee the face value of any check, draft, or money order which is dishonored by the drawee bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association due to insufficient funds or by reason of the account having been closed. The bond shall only be liable for the face value of the dishonored check, draft, or money order, and shall not be liable for any interest or consequential damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before granting a small loan endorsement under this chapter, the director shall require that the licensee file with the director a surety bond, in a format acceptable to the director, issued by a surety insurer that meets the requirements of chapter 48.28 RCW. The director shall adopt rules to determine the penal sum of the bond that shall be filed by each licensee. A licensee who wishes to engage in both check selling and making small loans may combine the penal sums of the bonding requirements and file one bond in a form acceptable to the director. The bond shall run to the state of Washington as obligee, and shall run to the benefit of the state and any person or persons who suffer loss by reason of the licensee's violation of this chapter or any rules adopted under this chapter. The bond shall only be liable for damages suffered by borrowers as a result of the licensee's violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, and shall not be liable for any interest or consequential damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bond shall be continuous and may be canceled by the surety upon the surety giving written notice to the director and licensee of its intent to cancel the bond. The cancellation is effective thirty days after the notice is received by the director. Whether or not the bond is renewed, continued, reinstated, reissued, or otherwise extended, replaced, or modified, including increases or decreases in the penal sum, it shall be considered one continuous obligation, and the surety upon the bond shall not be liable in an aggregate or cumulative amount exceeding the penal sum set forth on the face of the bond. In no event shall the penal sum, or any portion thereof, at two or more points in time be added together in determining the surety's liability. The bond shall not be liable for any liability of the licensee for tortious acts, whether or not such liability is imposed by statute or common law, or is imposed by contract. The bond shall not be a substitute or supplement to any liability or other insurance required by law or by the contract. If the surety desires to make payment without awaiting court action against it, the penal sum of the bond shall be reduced to the extent of any payment made by the surety in good faith under the bond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person who is a purchaser of a check, draft, or money order from the licensee having a claim against the licensee for the dishonor of any check, draft, or money order by the drawee bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association due to insufficient funds or by reason of the account having been closed, or who obtained a small loan from the licensee and was damaged by the licensee's violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, may bring suit upon such bond or deposit in the superior court of the county in which the check, draft, or money order was purchased, or in the superior court of a county in which the licensee maintains a place of business. Jurisdiction shall be exclusively in the superior court. Any such action must be brought not later than one year after the dishonor of the check, draft, or money order on which the claim is based. In the event valid claims against a bond or deposit exceed the amount of the bond or deposit, each claimant shall only be entitled to a pro rata amount, based on the amount of the claim as it is valid against the bond, or deposit, without regard to the date of filing of any claim or action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lieu of the surety bond required by this section, the applicant for a check seller license may file with the director a deposit consisting of cash or other security acceptable to the director in an amount equal to the penal sum of the required bond. In lieu of the surety bond required by this section, the applicant for a small loan endorsement may file with the director a deposit consisting of cash or other security acceptable to the director in an amount equal to the penal sum of the required bond, or may demonstrate to the director net worth in excess of three times the amount of the penal sum of the required bond.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The director may adopt rules necessary for the proper administration of the security or to establish reporting requirements to ensure that the net worth requirements continue to be met. A deposit given instead of the bond required by this section is not an asset of the licensee for the purpose of complying with the liquid asset provisions of this chapter. A deposit given instead of the bond required by this section is a fund held in trust for the benefit of eligible claimants under this section and is not an asset of the estate of any licensee that seeks protection voluntarily or involuntarily under the bankruptcy laws of the United States.</p>
<ol type="a" start="6">
<li>Such security may be sold by the director at public auction if it becomes necessary to satisfy the requirements of this chapter. Notice of the sale shall be served upon the licensee who placed the security personally or by mail. If notice is served by mail, service shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as it appears in the records of the director. Bearer bonds of the United States or the state of Washington without a prevailing market price must be sold at public auction. Such bonds having a prevailing market price may be sold at private sale not lower than the prevailing market price. Upon any sale, any surplus above amounts due shall be returned to the licensee, and the licensee shall deposit with the director additional security sufficient to meet the amount required by the director.

<p>Each applicant and licensee shall pay to the director an investigation or examination fee as established in rule and an annual assessment fee for the coming year in an amount determined by rule as necessary to cover the operation of the program. The annual assessment fee is due upon the annual assessment fee due date as established in rule. Nonpayment of the annual assessment fee may result in expiration of the license as provided in subsection (2) of this section. In establishing the fees, the director shall differentiate between check cashing and check selling and making small loans, and consider at least the volume of business, level of risk, and potential harm to the public related to each activity.

The licensee's payment of both the annual assessment fee and the late fee must arrive in the department's offices by 5:00 p.m. on the tenth day after the annual assessment fee due date, unless the department is not open for business on that date, in which case the licensee's payment of both the annual assessment fee and the late fee must arrive in the department's offices by 5:00 p.m. on the next occurring day that the department is open for business. If the payment of both the annual assessment fee and the late fee does not arrive prior to such time and date, then the expiration of the licensee's license is effective at 5:00 p.m. on the thirtieth day after the assessment fee due date.

<li>
<p>No licensee may engage in the business of making small loans without first obtaining a small loan endorsement to its license from the director in accordance with this chapter. An endorsement will be required for each location where a licensee engages in the business of making small loans, but a small loan endorsement may authorize a licensee to make small loans at a location different than the licensed locations where it cashes or sells checks. A licensee may have more than one endorsement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee must set the due date of a small loan on or after the date of the borrower's next pay date. If a borrower's next pay date is within seven days of taking out the loan, a licensee must set the due date of a small loan on or after the borrower's second pay date after the date the small loan is made. The termination date of a small loan may not exceed the origination date of that same small loan by more than forty-five days, including weekends and holidays, unless the term of the loan is extended by agreement of both the borrower and the licensee and no additional fee or interest is charged. The maximum principal amount of any small loan, or the outstanding principal balances of all small loans made by all licensees to a single borrower at any one time, may not exceed seven hundred dollars or thirty percent of the gross monthly income of the borrower, whichever is lower. A licensee is prohibited from making a small loan to a borrower who is in default on another small loan until after that loan is paid in full or two years have passed from the origination date of the small loan, whichever occurs first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee is prohibited from making a small loan to a borrower in an installment plan with any licensee until after the plan is paid in full or two years have passed from the origination date of the installment plan, whichever occurs first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A borrower is prohibited from receiving more than eight small loans from all licensees in any twelve-month period. A licensee is prohibited from making a small loan to a borrower if making that small loan would result in a borrower receiving more than eight small loans from all licensees in any twelve-month period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee that has obtained the required small loan endorsement may charge interest or fees for small loans not to exceed in the aggregate fifteen percent of the first five hundred dollars of principal. If the principal exceeds five hundred dollars, a licensee may charge interest or fees not to exceed in the aggregate ten percent of that portion of the principal in excess of five hundred dollars. If a licensee makes more than one loan to a single borrower, and the aggregated principal of all loans made to that borrower exceeds five hundred dollars at any one time, the licensee may charge interest or fees not to exceed in the aggregate ten percent on that portion of the aggregated principal of all loans at any one time that is in excess of five hundred dollars. The director may determine by rule which fees, if any, are not subject to the interest or fee limitations described in this section. It is a violation of this chapter for any licensee to knowingly loan to a single borrower at any one time, in a single loan or in the aggregate, more than the maximum principal amount described in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In connection with making a small loan, a licensee may advance moneys on the security of a postdated check. The licensee may not accept any other property, title to property, or other evidence of ownership of property as collateral for a small loan. The licensee may accept only one postdated check per loan as security for the loan. A licensee may permit a borrower to redeem a postdated check with a payment of cash or the equivalent of cash. The licensee may disburse the proceeds of a small loan in cash, in the form of a check, or in the form of the electronic equivalent of cash or a check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may at any time cash or advance any moneys on a postdated check or draft in excess of the amount of goods or services purchased without first obtaining a small loan endorsement to a check casher or check seller license.</p>

<p>All funds received by a licensee or its agents from the sale of checks, drafts, money orders, or other commercial paper serving the same purpose constitute trust funds owned by and belonging to the person from whom they were received or to the person who has paid the checks, drafts, money orders, or other commercial paper serving the same purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All such trust funds shall be deposited in a bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association located in Washington state in an account or accounts in the name of the licensee designated &quot;trust account,&quot; or by some other appropriate name indicating that the funds are not the funds of the licensee or of its officers, employees, or agents. Such funds are not subject to attachment, levy of execution, or sequestration by order of a court except by a payee, assignee, or holder in due course of a check, draft, or money order sold by a licensee or its agent. Funds in the trust account, together with funds and checks on hand and in the hands of agents held for the account of the licensee at all times shall be at least equal to the aggregate liability of the licensee on account of checks, drafts, money orders, or other commercial paper serving the same purpose that are sold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director shall adopt rules requiring the licensee to periodically withdraw from the trust account the portion of trust funds earned by the licensee from the sale of checks, drafts, money orders, or other commercial paper serving the same purpose. If a licensee has accepted, in payment for a check, draft, money order, or commercial paper serving the same purpose issued by the licensee, a check or draft that is subsequently dishonored, the director shall prohibit the withdrawal of earned funds in an amount necessary to cover the dishonored check or draft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a licensee or its agent commingles trust funds with its own funds, all assets belonging to the licensee or its agent are impressed with a trust in favor of the persons specified in subsection (1) of this section in an amount equal to the aggregate funds that should have been segregated. Such trust continues until an amount equal to the necessary aggregate funds have been deposited in accordance with subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon request of the director, a licensee shall furnish to the director an authorization for examination of financial records of any trust fund account established for compliance with this section.</p>

<p>A licensee shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws when collecting a delinquent small loan. A licensee may charge a one-time fee as determined in rule by the director to any borrower in default on any loan or loans where the borrower's check has been returned unpaid by the financial institution upon which it was drawn. A licensee may take civil action under Title 62A RCW to collect upon a check that has been dishonored. If the licensee takes civil action, a licensee may charge the borrower the cost of collection as allowed under RCW 62A.3-515, but may not collect attorneys' fees or any other interest or damages as allowed under RCW 62A.3-515. A licensee may not threaten criminal prosecution as a method of collecting a delinquent small loan or threaten to take any legal action against the borrower which the licensee may not legally take.</p>

<p>A licensee may not communicate with a borrower in such a manner as to harass, intimidate, abuse, or embarrass a borrower, including but not limited to communication at an unreasonable hour, with unreasonable frequency, by threats of force or violence, or by use of offensive language. A communication shall be presumed to have been made for the purposes of harassment if it is initiated by the licensee for the purposes of collection and:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It is made with a borrower or spouse in any form, manner, or place, more than three times in a single week;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is made with a borrower at his or her place of employment more than one time in a single week or made to a borrower after the licensee has been informed that the borrower's employer prohibits such communications;</p>

<li>
<p>An unanswered telephone call in which no message (other than a caller ID) is left, unless the telephone call violates subsection (3)(c) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An initial letter to the borrower that includes disclosures intended to comply with the federal fair debt collection practices act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, (a) a communication occurs at the time it is initiated by a licensee regardless of the time it is received or accessed by the borrower, and (b) a call to a number that the licensee reasonably believes is the borrower's cell phone will not constitute a communication with a borrower at the borrower's place of employment.</p>

<p>If a borrower notifies a licensee that the borrower will be or is unable to repay a loan when it is due, the licensee must inform the borrower that the borrower may convert their small loan to an installment plan. The licensee must convert the small loan to an installment plan at the borrower's request. Each agreement for a loan installment plan must be in writing and acknowledged by both the borrower and the licensee. The licensee may not assess any other fee, interest charge, or other charge on the borrower as a result of converting the small loan into an installment plan. This installment plan must provide for the payment of the total of payments due on the small loan over a period not less than ninety days for a loan amount of up to and including four hundred dollars. For a loaned amount over four hundred dollars, the installment plan must be a period not less than one hundred eighty days. The borrower may pay the total of installments at any time. The licensee may not charge any penalty, fee, or charge to the borrower for prepayment of the loan installment plan by the borrower. Each licensee shall conspicuously disclose to each borrower in the small loan agreement or small loan note that the borrower has access to such an installment plan. A licensee's violation of such an installment plan constitutes a violation of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licensee must return any postdated checks that the borrower has given to the licensee for the original small loan at the initiation of the installment plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee may take postdated checks for installment plan payments at the time the installment plan is originated. If any check accepted as payment under the installment plan is dishonored, the licensee may not charge the borrower any fee for the dishonored check. If a borrower defaults on the installment plan, the licensee may charge the borrower a one-time installment plan default fee of twenty-five dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the licensee enters into an installment plan with the borrower through an accredited third party, with certified credit counselors, that is representing the borrower, the licensee's failure to comply with the terms of that installment plan constitutes a violation of this chapter.</p>
