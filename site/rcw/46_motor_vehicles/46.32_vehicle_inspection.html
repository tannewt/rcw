Those motor carriers that have operations in this state are subject to the patrol's safety audits and compliance review programs. Compliance reviews may result in the initiation of an enforcement action, which may include monetary penalties.

<li>
<p>The Washington state patrol, in consultation with the department of licensing, shall adopt rules consistent with this chapter to regulate vehicle safety requirements for motor carriers who own, control, manage, or operate a commercial motor vehicle within this state. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the rules adopted by the state patrol under this section must be as rigorous as federal regulations governing certain interstate motor carriers at 49 C.F.R. Parts 40 and 380 through 397, which cover the areas of commercial motor carrier driver training, controlled substance and alcohol use and testing, compliance with the federal driver's license requirements and penalties, vehicle equipment and safety standards, hazardous material practices, financial responsibility, driver qualifications, hours of service, vehicle inspection and corrective actions, and assessed penalties for noncompliance. The state patrol shall amend these rules periodically to maintain, to the extent permissible under this chapter, standards as rigorous as the federal regulations governing certain interstate motor carriers. The state patrol shall submit a report to the legislature by December 31st of each year that outlines new rules or rule changes and explains how the state rules compare to the federal regulations.</p>
