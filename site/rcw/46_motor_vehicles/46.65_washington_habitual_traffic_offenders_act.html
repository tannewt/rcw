<li>
<p>To provide maximum safety for all persons who travel or otherwise use the public highways of this state; and</p>

<p>To deny the privilege of operating motor vehicles on such highways to persons who by their conduct and record have demonstrated their indifference for the safety and welfare of others and their disrespect for the laws of the state, the orders of her courts and the statutorily required acts of her administrative agencies; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To discourage repetition of criminal acts by individuals against the peace and dignity of the state and her political subdivisions and to impose increased and added deprivation of the privilege to operate motor vehicles upon habitual offenders who have been convicted repeatedly of violations of traffic laws.</p>

Said stay shall continue as long as there is no further conviction for any of the offenses listed in RCW 46.65.020(1).

<p>Whenever a person's driving record, as maintained by the department, brings him or her within the definition of an habitual traffic offender, as defined in RCW 46.65.020, the department shall forthwith notify the person of the revocation in writing by certified mail at his or her address of record as maintained by the department. If the person is a nonresident of this state, notice shall be sent to the person's last known address. Notices of revocation shall inform the recipient thereof of his or her right to a formal hearing and specify the steps which must be taken in order to obtain a hearing. Within fifteen days after the notice has been given, the person may, in writing, request a formal hearing. If such a request is not made within the prescribed time the right to a hearing is waived. A request for a hearing stays the effectiveness of the revocation.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the department shall schedule a hearing in the county in which the person making the request resides, and if [the] person is a nonresident of this state, the hearing shall be held in Thurston county. The department shall give at least ten days notice of the hearing to the person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scope of the hearings provided by this section is limited to the issues of whether the certified transcripts or abstracts of the convictions, as maintained by the department, show that the requisite number of violations have been accumulated within the prescribed period of time as set forth in RCW 46.65.020 and whether the terms and conditions for granting stays, as provided in RCW 46.65.060, have been met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of the hearing officer's decision, an aggrieved party may appeal to the superior court of the county in which he or she resides, or, in the case of a nonresident of this state, in the superior court of Thurston county, for review of the revocation. Notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after receipt of the hearing officer's decision or the right to appeal is waived. Review by the court shall be de novo and without a jury.</p>

<p>The filing of a notice of appeal does not stay the effective date of the revocation.</p>
