<p>The department of licensing shall have the authority to execute agreements, arrangements, or declarations to carry out the provisions of chapter 46.87 RCW and this chapter.</p>
<p>If the department enters into a multistate proportional registration agreement which requires this state to perform acts in a quasi agency relationship, the department may collect and forward applicable registration fees and applications to other jurisdictions on behalf of the applicant or on behalf of another jurisdiction and may take such other action as will facilitate the administration of such agreement.</p>
<p>If the department enters into a multistate proportional registration agreement which prescribes procedures applicable to vehicles not specifically described in chapter 46.87 RCW, such as but not limited to &quot;owner-operator&quot; or &quot;rental&quot; vehicles, it shall promulgate rules taking exception to or accomplishing the procedures prescribed in such agreement.</p>
<p>It is the purpose and intent of this subsection to facilitate the membership in the International Registration Plan and at the same time allow the department to continue to participate in such agreements and compacts as may be necessary and desirable in addition to the International Registration Plan.</p>
