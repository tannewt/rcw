<p>The legislature finds and declares that the distribution and sale of vehicle parts in the state of Washington vitally affects the general economy of the state and the public interest and the public welfare, and that in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare and in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate and license vehicle wreckers and dismantlers, the buyers-for-resale, and the sellers of secondhand vehicle components doing business in Washington, in order to prevent the sale of stolen vehicle parts, to prevent frauds, impositions, and other abuses, and to preserve the investments and properties of the citizens of this state.</p>
