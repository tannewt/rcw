<p>If the surviving partner or partners fail or refuse to furnish an inventory or list of liabilities, to permit an appraisal, or to account to the personal representative, or to furnish a bond when required pursuant to RCW 11.64.016, the court shall order a citation to issue requiring the surviving partner or partners to appear and show cause why they have not furnished an inventory list of liabilities, or permitted an appraisal or why they should not account to the personal representative or file a bond. The citation shall be served not less than ten days before the return day designated therein, or such shorter period as the court upon a showing of good cause deems appropriate. If the surviving partner or partners neglect or refuse to file an inventory or list of liabilities, or to permit an appraisal, or fail to account to the court or to file a bond, after they have been directed to do so, they may be punished for a contempt of court as provided in chapter 7.21 RCW. Where the surviving partner or partners fail to file a bond after being ordered to do so by the court, the court may also appoint a receiver of the partnership estate under chapter 7.60 RCW, and may order the costs and expenses of the proceedings to be paid out of the partnership estate or out of the estate of the decedent, or by the surviving partner or partners personally, or partly by each of the parties.</p>

<p>The surviving partner or the surviving partners jointly, shall have the right at any time to petition the court to purchase the interests of a deceased partner in the partnership.

<p>The court may, in instances where it is deemed advisable, authorize and direct the personal representative of the estate of a deceased partner to enter into an agreement with the surviving partner or partners under which the surviving partner or partners may continue to operate any going business of the former partnership until the further order of the court. The court may, in its discretion, revoke such authority and direction and thereby terminate such agreement at any time by further order, entered upon the application of the personal representative or the surviving partner or partners or any interested person or on its own motion.</p>
