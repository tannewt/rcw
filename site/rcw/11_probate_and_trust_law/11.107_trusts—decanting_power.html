<p>The trustee of the first trust, qualified beneficiaries, and any other party as defined by RCW 11.96A.030(5) may agree to exercise by the trustee of the decanting power by means of a binding agreement under RCW 11.96A.220.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trustee of the first trust, a qualified beneficiary, a holder of a presently exercisable power of appointment over any part of the first trust, and a person that currently has the right to remove or replace the trustee may petition the court under chapter 11.96A RCW regarding exercise of the decanting power for the following relief, to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide instructions to the trustee regarding whether a proposed exercise of the decanting power is permitted under this chapter and consistent with the fiduciary duties of the trustee;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approve an exercise of the decanting power;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine that a proposed or attempted exercise of the decanting power is ineffective because the proposed or attempted exercise does not or did comply with this chapter or the proposed or attempted exercise would be or was an abuse of the trustee's discretion or a breach of fiduciary duty; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Order other relief to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<p>If there is at least one qualified beneficiary who is not a minor or who has a representative, the trustee is not required to give notice under subsection (1)(c) of this section to a qualified beneficiary who is a minor and has no representative.

<p>A notice under subsection (1) of this section or petition under subsection (3) or (4) of this section must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Specify the manner in which the trustee must exercise the decanting power;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The decanting power may be exercised before expiration of the notice period under subsection (1) of this section if all persons entitled to receive notice waive the period in writing.

<li>
<p>A trustee or other person that reasonably relies on the validity of a distribution of part or all of the income and principal of a trust to another trust, or a modification of a trust, under this chapter or the law of another jurisdiction is not liable to any person for any action or failure to act as a result of the reliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A debt, liability, or other obligation enforceable against income and principal of a first trust is enforceable to the same extent against that income and principal when held by the second trust after exercise of the decanting power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of the law of this state other than this chapter and subject to this subsection, a settlor of a first trust is deemed to be the settlor of the second trust with respect to the portion of the principal of the first trust subject to the exercise of the decanting power. In determining settlor intent with respect to a second trust, the intent of a settlor of the first trust and the intent of a settlor of the second trust, if different, may be considered. The intent of the trustee may also be considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the trustee intends to distribute all of the principal of a first trust to a second trust and the trustee makes a good faith effort to do so, the distribution of all of the principal of a first trust to a second trust includes subsequently discovered assets otherwise belonging to the first trust and principal paid to or acquired by the first trust after the distribution of the first trust's principal. If the trustee does not intend to distribute all of the principal of a first trust to a second trust, the distribution of part of the principal of a first trust to a second trust does not include subsequently discovered assets belonging to the first trust or principal paid to or acquired by the first trust after the distribution of principal from the first trust to the second trust, and those assets or that principal remain the assets or principal of the first trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reference under this title to a trust instrument or to terms of the trust includes the second trust, the second trust instrument, and the terms of the second trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The title to all real estate and other property, both tangible and intangible, owned by the first trust remains vested in the second trust without reversion or impairment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An action or proceeding pending by or against the first trust may be continued by or against the second trust as if the decanting had not occurred.</p>

<li>
<p>This chapter applies to any express trust, within the meaning of RCW 11.98.009, other than a trust during such time as the grantor has retained the right to revoke or amend. In exercising the decanting power, the trustee must act in accordance with the trustee's fiduciary duties, including the duty to act in accordance with the purposes of the first trust. Except as otherwise provided in the first trust instrument, for purposes of this chapter the terms of the first trust are deemed to include the decanting power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter does not limit the power of a trustee, powerholder, or other person to distribute or appoint income and principal in further trust or to modify a trust under the trust instrument, law of this state other than this title, a court order, or a nonjudicial agreement. This chapter does not increase or modify the requirements for a binding agreement under RCW  11.96A.220 or the requirements for a directed trust under *chapter 11.98A RCW. This chapter does not affect the ability of a settlor to provide in a trust instrument for the distribution or appointment in further trust of the trust income and principal or for modification of the trust instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter does not apply to a trust held solely for charitable purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter does not create or imply a duty to exercise the decanting power or to inform beneficiaries about the applicability of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter applies to a trust created before, on, or after July 23, 2017, that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Has its situs in this state, including a trust whose situs has been changed to this state; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides by its trust instrument that it is governed by the law of this state or is governed by the law of this state for purposes of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Administration, including a trust whose governing law for purposes of administration has been changed to the law of this state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construction of terms of the trust; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining the meaning or effect of terms of the trust.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A trustee may exercise the decanting power whether or not the trustee would have made or could have been compelled to make a discretionary distribution of principal at the time of the exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If exercise of the decanting power would be effective under this chapter except that the second trust instrument in part does not comply with this chapter, the exercise of the decanting power is effective and the following rules apply to the principal of the first trust subject to the exercise of the power:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A provision in the second trust instrument which is not permitted under this chapter is void to the extent necessary to comply with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A provision required by this chapter to be in the second trust instrument which is not contained in the instrument is deemed to be included in the instrument to the extent necessary to comply with this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a trustee of a second trust discovers that subsection (7) of this section applies to a prior exercise of the decanting power, the trustee must take such appropriate corrective action as is consistent with the trustee's duties.</p>
</li>
