The payment of the mortgage debt, with interest and costs, at any time before sale, shall satisfy the judgment. The court, in ordering the sale, may in its discretion, take judicial notice of economic conditions, and after a proper hearing, fix a minimum or upset price to which the mortgaged premises must be bid or sold before confirmation of the sale.</p>
<p>The court may, upon application for the confirmation of a sale, if it has not theretofore fixed an upset price, conduct a hearing, establish the value of the property, and, as a condition to confirmation, require that the fair value of the property be credited upon the foreclosure judgment. If an upset price has been established, the plaintiff may be required to credit this amount upon the judgment as a condition to confirmation. If the fair value as found by the court, when applied to the mortgage debt, discharges it, no deficiency judgment shall be granted.</p>

<p>In actions to foreclose mortgages on real property improved by structure or structures, if the court finds that the mortgagor or his or her successor in interest has abandoned said property for six months or more, the purchaser at the sheriff's sale shall take title in and to such property free from all redemption rights as provided for in RCW 6.23.010 et seq. upon confirmation of the sheriff's sale by the court. Lack of occupancy by, or by authority of, the mortgagor or his or her successor in interest for a continuous period of six months or more prior to the date of the decree of foreclosure, coupled with failure to make payment upon the mortgage obligation within the said six month period, will be prima facie evidence of abandonment.</p>

<p>Before any mortgagee of residential real property commences any legal action under RCW 61.12.040 to foreclose any reverse residential mortgage, such person shall give the mortgagor notice of such intention at least thirty-three days in advance. For the purposes of this section &quot;residential real property&quot; means property consisting solely of a single-family residence, a two-to-four-unit owner-occupied dwelling, a residential condominium unit, a manufactured home, or a residential cooperative unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice of intention to take action as specified in subsection (1) of this section must be in writing and sent to the resident mortgagor or, in case of the death of the last surviving mortgagor, addressed to any known surviving spouse or to &quot;unknown heirs&quot; of the residential mortgagor, by first-class and either certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, at his or her last known address and, if different, at the residence which is the subject of the residential mortgage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The written notice must be in English and Spanish, in a form to be published by the department of commerce, and must clearly and conspicuously state:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The particular obligation or real estate security interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nature of the default claimed or the reason for acceleration of the mortgage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except in cases where the acceleration is due to the death of the last surviving mortgagor, the right, if any, of the mortgagor to cure the default and exactly what performance, including what sum of money, if any, must be tendered to cure the default;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except in cases where the acceleration is due to the death of the last surviving mortgagor, the applicable time within which the mortgagor must cure the default;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement printed in no less than twelve-point font and bolded that reads:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;If you do nothing to cure the default, if any, we intend to start a lawsuit to foreclose your mortgaged property. If the mortgage is foreclosed, your mortgaged property will be sold to pay off the mortgage debt. You should contact a housing counselor or attorney as soon as possible.&quot;; and</p>
<ol type="a" start="6">
<li>The toll-free telephone number to find a department-approved home equity conversion mortgage counseling agency from the United States department of housing and urban development, the toll-free numbers for the statewide foreclosure hotline recommended by the housing finance commission, and the statewide civil legal aid hotline for assistance and referrals.</li>
