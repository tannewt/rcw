<li>
<p>If a demand for payment under RCW 25.10.876 remains unsettled, the limited partnership shall commence a proceeding within sixty days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the partnership interest and accrued interest. If the limited partnership does not commence the proceeding within the sixty-day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limited partnership shall commence the proceeding in the superior court in the county where its office is or was maintained as required by RCW 25.10.121.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limited partnership shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding as in an action against their partnership interests and all parties must be served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limited partnership may join as a party to the proceeding any partner who claims to be a dissenter but who has not, in the opinion of the limited partnership, complied with the provisions of this chapter. If the court determines that such partner has not complied with the provisions of this article, the partner shall be dismissed as a party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decisions on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the powers described in the order appointing them or in any amendment to it. The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter's partnership interest, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the limited partnership.</p>

<li>
<p>The court in a proceeding commenced under RCW 25.10.881 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the limited partnership, except that the court may assess the costs against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in demanding payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Against the limited partnership and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds the limited partnership did not substantially comply with the requirements of this article; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Against either the limited partnership or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the limited partnership, the court may award to these counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the dissenters who were benefited.</p>
