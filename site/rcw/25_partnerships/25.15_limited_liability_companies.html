<ol>
<li>
<p>If a demand for payment under RCW 25.15.491 remains unsettled, the limited liability company must commence a proceeding within sixty days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the dissenting member's interest in the limited liability company, and accrued interest. If the limited liability company does not commence the proceeding within the sixty-day period, it must pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limited liability company must commence the proceeding in the superior court of the county where the limited liability company's principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office is located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limited liability company must make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding as in an action against their membership interests in the limited liability company and all parties must be served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limited liability company may join as a party to the proceeding any member who claims to be a dissenter but who has not, in the opinion of the limited liability company, complied with the provisions of this article. If the court determines that such member has not complied with the provisions of this article, the member must be dismissed as a party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decisions on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the powers described in the order appointing them or in any amendment to it. The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter's membership interest in the limited liability company, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the limited liability company.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The court in a proceeding commenced under RCW 25.15.516 must determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court must assess the costs against the limited liability company, except that the court may assess the costs against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in demanding payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Against the limited liability company and in favor of any or all dissenters if the court finds the limited liability company did not substantially comply with the requirements of this article; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Against either the limited liability company or a dissenter, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds that the services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the limited liability company, the court may award to these counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded to the dissenters who were benefited.</p>
