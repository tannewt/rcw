Such sum is to be computed in an amount directly proportional to the estimated entire expense of the administration as the ratio of monthly salaries of the employer's members bears to the total salaries of all members in the entire system. It shall then be the duty of all such employers to include in their budgets or otherwise provide the amounts so required.</p>

<p>The department shall compute and bill each employer, as defined in RCW 28B.10.400, 41.26.030, 41.32.010, 41.35.010, 41.37.010, or 41.40.010, at the end of each month for the amount due for that month to the department of retirement systems expense fund and the same shall be paid as are its other obligations. Such computation as to each employer shall be made on a percentage rate of salary established by the department. However, the department may at its discretion establish a system of billing based upon calendar year quarters in which event the said billing shall be at the end of each such quarter.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Every six months the department shall determine the amount of an employer's fee by reviewing the timeliness and accuracy of the reports submitted by the employer in the preceding six months. If those reports were not both timely and accurate the department may prospectively assess an additional fee under this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An additional fee assessed by the department under this subsection shall not exceed fifty percent of the standard fee.</p>

<p>The director may at any time correct errors appearing in the records of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030. Should any error in such records result in any member, beneficiary, or other person or entity receiving more or less than he or she would have been entitled to had the records been correct, the director, subject to the conditions set forth in this section, shall adjust the payment in such a manner that the benefit to which such member, beneficiary, or other person or entity was correctly entitled shall be paid in accordance with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In the case of underpayments to a member or beneficiary, the retirement system shall correct all future payments from the point of error detection, and shall compute the additional payment due for the allowable prior period which shall be paid in a lump sum by the appropriate retirement system.</p>

<p>In the case of overpayments to a retiree or other beneficiary, the retirement system shall adjust the payment so that the retiree or beneficiary receives the benefit to which he or she is correctly entitled.

<p>Except in the case of actual fraud, no monthly benefit shall be reduced by more than fifty percent of the member's or beneficiary's corrected benefit. Any overpayment not recovered due to the inability to actuarially reduce a member's benefit due to: (a) The provisions of this subsection; or (b) the fact that the retiree's monthly retirement allowance is less than the monthly payment required to effectuate an actuarial reduction, shall constitute a claim against the estate of a member, beneficiary, or other person or entity in receipt of an overpayment.</p>

To avoid unduly impacting the retirement allowances of persons who have retired on or before June 9, 1994, the department is not required to correct, nor cause to be corrected, any misreporting of amounts identified as standby pay through June 9, 1994.

<p>The forgiveness of past misreporting under subsection (2) of this section constitutes a benefit enhancement for those individuals for whom amounts received as standby pay were misreported to the department.

<p>If the department finds that any member, beneficiary, or other person or entity has been paid an amount of retirement benefits to which that person or entity is not entitled, and the person is not entitled to a continuing benefit from any of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030, the department may issue an order and notice of assessment specifying the amount due, including interest, to be remitted to the department. The order and notice of assessment shall be served upon any person or entity who may have received benefits to which the person or entity is not entitled. The order and notice of assessment shall be served by the department in the manner prescribed for the service of a summons in a civil action, or by certified mail to the last known address of the obligor as shown by the records of the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any notice of assessment under subsection (1) of this section shall constitute a determination of liability from which the member, beneficiary, or other person or entity served may appeal by filing a petition for adjudicative proceedings with the director personally or by mail within sixty days from the date the assessment was served. If a petition for adjudicative proceedings is not filed within sixty days of the delivery of the notice of assessment, the determination that was the basis for establishing the overpayment debt and the assessment is conclusive and final.</p>

<li>
<p>This section creates an administrative process for the collection of overpayments from persons who are not entitled to a continuing benefit from one of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030. The collection of overpayments from persons entitled to a continuing benefit from one of the retirement systems listed in RCW 41.50.030 is governed by RCW 41.50.130.</p>

The clerk of the county where the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for the warrant, and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of the person mentioned in the warrant, the amount of the notice of determination of liability, and the date when the warrant was filed. The amount of the warrant as docketed shall become a lien upon the title to, and any interest in, all real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case duly docketed in the office of such clerk.

<p>This section does not require a member to select a standard allowance upon retirement nor does it require the department to recalculate the amount of a retiree's periodic retirement payment based on a change in survivor option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court order under this section may not order the department to pay more than seventy-five percent of an obligor's periodic retirement payment to an obligee.</p>

<p>A division of benefits pursuant to a dissolution order under this section shall be based upon the obligor's gross benefit prior to any deductions. If the department is required to withhold a portion of the member's benefit pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 3402 and the sum of that amount plus the amount owed to the obligee exceeds the total benefit, the department shall satisfy the withholding requirements under 26 U.S.C. Sec. 3402 and then pay the remainder to the obligee. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to amounts withheld pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Sec. 3402(i).</p>

<li>
<p>Any organization that exclusively provides representation or services to retired members of the Washington state retirement systems and has membership dues deducted through the department of retirement systems has the right to request the department to assist in doing blind mailings to retirees twice each year. The mailings must provide information to members of the retirement systems eligible for membership in the retiree organization regarding services offered by the retiree organization. The mailings shall not be for the purpose of supporting or opposing any political party, ballot measure, or candidate. The retiree organization must provide all printed materials to be mailed and envelopes to a mail processing center and pay all costs for generating mailing labels, inserting materials into envelopes, sealing, labeling, and delivering materials to be mailed to a bulk mail center or post office. The organization must use its own bulk mail permit and pay all postage costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must provide requested retiree data for addressing the envelopes to the mail center under a secure data share agreement with the mail center under which neither the organizations nor any other entity has direct access to any names or addresses. The department has no obligation to approve or disapprove, or in any other way take any responsibility for, the content of the mailings. Only organizations that meet the requirements under subsection (1) of this section and have legal authority to provide services to retirement system retirees have the right to request assistance with blind mailings.</p>
