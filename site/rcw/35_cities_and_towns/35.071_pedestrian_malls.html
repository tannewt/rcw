Any corporate authority, by ordinance, may establish and regulate any street right-of-way as a mall, may prohibit, in whole or in part, vehicular traffic on a mall, and may provide for the acquisition of any interest in the right-of-way necessary to its establishment, and may provide for the determination of legal damages, if any, to abutting property.</p>

<p>When the corporate authority determines that the public interest, safety, and convenience is best served by the establishment of a mall and that vehicular traffic will not be unduly inconvenienced thereby, it may adopt a resolution declaring its intention to do so, and announcing the intended extent of traffic limitation. Any corporate authority is authorized to limit the utilization of any right-of-way, except for utilities and governmental functions, provided adequate alternative routes for vehicular movement, and the loading and unloading of goods are established or are available. The abutting property owner's right of ingress and egress shall be considered to have been satisfied whenever the corporate authority has planned and constructed, or there is available, an alternate route, alleyway, and service driveway.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>By creating local improvement districts under the laws applicable thereto in Title 35 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By issuing revenue bonds pursuant to chapter 35.41 RCW, *RCW 35.24.305, chapter 35.92 RCW, RCW 35.81.100, and by such other statutes that may authorize such bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By issuing general obligation bonds pursuant to chapter 39.52 RCW, RCW 35.81.115, and by such other statutes and applicable provisions of the state Constitution that may authorize such bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By use of gifts and donations.</p>

<li>
<p>General fund and other available moneys: PROVIDED, That if any general fund moneys are expended for a mall, provision may be made for repayment thereof to the general fund from money received from the financing of the mall.</p>
