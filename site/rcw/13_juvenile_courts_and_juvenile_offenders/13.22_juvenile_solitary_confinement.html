<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that prolonged isolation for juveniles may cause harm. Prolonged solitary confinement has also been shown as ineffective at reducing behavioral incidents and may increase anxiety and anger in youth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating alternative solutions to solitary confinement for juveniles will further protect the well-being of juveniles in all detention facilities and institutions and enhance the rehabilitative goals of Washington's juvenile justice system. Chapter 333, Laws of 2020 seeks to end the use of solitary confinement in juvenile facilities when used as a form of punishment or retaliation. Chapter 333, Laws of 2020 also seeks to limit placement in isolation, except in the circumstances outlined in RCW 13.22.020. Juvenile institutions and detention facilities must implement a system of graduated interventions to avoid the use of solitary confinement. Less restrictive forms of confinement should be used to regulate the behavior of juveniles in institutions and detention facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to prevent the use of solitary confinement and, in the limited instances of isolation, ensure that the use advances the rehabilitative goals of Washington's juvenile justice system, and that it is not used as a punitive measure.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Detention facility&quot; means:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any detention facility as defined under RCW 13.40.020; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any juvenile correctional facility under alternative administration operated by a consortium of counties under RCW 13.04.035.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<p>&quot;Institution&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 13.40.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Isolation&quot; means confinement that occurs (a) when a youth is separated from the youth population and placed in a room for longer than fifteen minutes for the purpose of discipline, behavior modification, or due to an imminent threat to the safety of the youth or others; and (b) in a room other than the room assigned to the youth for sleeping. Juveniles are in isolation from the moment they are separated from others until they have rejoined the population. Juveniles who are pregnant shall not be put into isolation. Maintaining appropriate gender separation does not constitute isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Juvenile&quot; means:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any individual who is under the chronological age of eighteen years; and</p>

<p>&quot;Room confinement&quot; means a juvenile is separated from the youth population and placed in a room or cell that the juvenile is assigned to for sleeping, other than during normal sleeping hours or interim rest hours. &quot;Room confinement&quot; does not include time a youth requests to spend in his or her room or rest periods in between facility programming. Juveniles are in room confinement from the moment they are separated from others until they are permitted to rejoin the population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Solitary confinement&quot; means a youth is involuntarily separated from the youth population and placed in a room or cell other than the room assigned to the youth for sleeping for longer than fifteen minutes for punitive purposes. Different terminology does not exempt practice from being &quot;solitary confinement.&quot;</p>

<li>
<p>Total isolation and room confinement of a juvenile shall be limited in duration to no more than four hours in any twenty-four hour period.

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A medical and mental health assessment may occur after the juvenile's release so as not to extend his or her time in isolation or confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the total isolation or room confinement exceeds twenty-four hours, then the secretary, or his or her designee, of the department or the juvenile court administrator must provide documented authorization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each juvenile placed in isolation or room confinement shall be visually checked at least every fifteen minutes, and staff shall attend to the needs of the juvenile at that time. Staff shall attempt to communicate with an awake juvenile during required checks to evaluate and encourage the juvenile on the goals and objectives the juvenile needs to achieve in order to be released from isolation or room confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every instance of isolation and room confinement shall be documented in accordance with RCW 13.22.040 or 13.22.050.</p>

<li>
<p>Reading material, paper, writing material, envelopes, and treatment material, unless precluded by suicide precaution level or the items would hinder staff efforts to resolve the problems that caused isolation or room confinement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff must remove the juvenile from isolation and room confinement when one of the following requirements is met:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The purpose of the confinement is met;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desired behavior is evident; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile has been evaluated by a professional who has determined the juvenile is no longer an imminent risk to self, staff, or the general population. The institution or detention facility may designate who counts as a professional.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolation can be used when:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Isolation is necessary to prevent imminent harm based on the juvenile's behavior, and less restrictive alternatives were unsuccessful;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile needs to be held in isolation awaiting transfer of facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile needs to be placed in isolation overnight due to disruptive behavior that prevents the nighttime routine of other juvenile residents; or</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section requires that juveniles be placed with adults while in custody.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall, by July 1, 2021, adopt a model policy prohibiting the use of solitary confinement of juveniles in detention facilities and institutions, with the goal of also limiting the use and duration of isolation and room confinement. In determining the model policy, the department must consult with appropriate stakeholders including, but not limited to, juvenile court administrators, impacted youth, and representatives of staff. At a minimum, the model policy must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Isolation. Isolation may only be used as a last resort when less restrictive methods have not been effective. Where needed, medical professionals must assess or evaluate any juvenile in isolation as soon as possible after the juvenile is placed in isolation, and qualified mental health professionals must evaluate and develop a care plan for juveniles placed in isolation to prevent self-harm as soon as possible after the juvenile is placed in isolation. The model policy must include measures to prevent the use of isolation, while protecting the safety and security of incarcerated juveniles and their peers, the staff of the detention facilities and institutions, other persons who work in the detention facilities and institutions, and visitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room confinement. Room confinement is the preferred option for maladaptive or negative behavior. Staff will use the least amount of time to meet the purpose of the intervention. The model policy must include measures to prevent the use of room confinement, while protecting the safety and security of incarcerated juveniles and their peers, the staff of the detention facilities and institutions, other persons who work in the detention facilities and institutions, and visitors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2021, the detention facility or institution shall review and either (a) adopt the model policy established in this section or (b) notify the department of the reasons the detention facility or institution will not adopt the model policy, including how the detention facility or institution's policies and procedures differ from the model policy.</p>
