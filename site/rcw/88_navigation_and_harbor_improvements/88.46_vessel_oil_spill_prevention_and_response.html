<p>In addition to any notifications that the owner or operator of a covered vessel must provide to the United States coast guard regarding a vessel emergency, the owner or operator of a covered vessel must notify the state of any vessel emergency that results in the discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil to state waters or that may affect the natural resources of the state within one hour of the onset of that emergency. The purpose of this notification is to enable the department to coordinate with the vessel operator, contingency plan holder, and the United States coast guard to protect the public health, welfare, and natural resources of the state and to ensure all reasonable spill preparedness and response measures are in place prior to a spill occurring.</p>

<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to provide the various components of the maritime industry with the tools necessary to satisfy the requirements of RCW 88.46.130 in the most cost-effective manner. In doing, the legislature encourages, but does not mandate, the maritime industry to unite behind their mutual interests and responsibilities and identify or form a single umbrella organization that allows all affected covered vessels to equitably share the costs inherent in the implementation of RCW 88.46.130.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that, given the broad range of covered vessel types and sizes, an equitable sharing of the costs of implementing RCW 88.46.130 will likely mean that not all covered vessels will be responsible for providing the same amount of funding. Any umbrella organization that is identified or formed to satisfy the requirements of chapter 11, Laws of 2009 should consider the multitude of factors that comprise the risk of vessel emergencies and the likelihood of initiating a response from the emergency response vessel required by RCW 88.46.130.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to provide the authority for any operator of a covered vessel that feels as though an umbrella organization that is identified, formed, or proposed for formation does not equitably share the costs of compliance with RCW 88.46.130 with the covered vessel in question, or the class of vessel to which the covered vessel belongs, to either contract directly with an adequate emergency response vessel or form or join a discreet umbrella organization representing the appropriate segment of the maritime industry. However, if the operator of a covered vessel chooses not to join a proposed or existing umbrella organization, or finds that negotiations leading to the formation of an umbrella organization are not progressing in an adequate manner, the legislature requests, but does not require, that the vessel operator contact the department and provide official notice of their concern as to how the umbrella group in question failed in establishing an equitable cost-share strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall collect and maintain all notices received under this section and shall summarize any reports received by the operators of covered vessels and report the summation to the appropriate committees of the legislature upon request by a legislative committee.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish a volunteer coordination system. The volunteer coordination system may be included as a part of the state's overall oil spill response strategy, and may be implemented by local emergency management organizations, in coordination with any analogous federal efforts, to supplement the state's timely and effective response to spills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department should consider how the volunteer coordination system will:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Coordinate with the incident commander or unified command of an oil spill and any affected local governments to receive, screen, and register volunteers who are not affiliated with the emergency management organization or a local nongovernmental organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate the management of volunteers with local nongovernmental organizations and their affiliated volunteers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate appropriate response operations with different classes of volunteers, including pretrained volunteers and convergent volunteers, to fulfill requests by the department or an oil spill incident commander or unified command;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate public outreach regarding the need for and use of volunteers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine minimum participation criteria for volunteers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify volunteer training requirements and, if applicable, provide training opportunities for volunteers prior to an oil spill response incident.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An act or omission by any volunteer participating in a spill response or training as part of a volunteer coordination system, while engaged in such activities, does not impose any liability on any state agency, any participating local emergency management organization, or the volunteer for civil damages resulting from the act or omission. However, the immunity provided under this subsection does not apply to an act or omission that constitutes gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decisions to utilize volunteers in an oil spill response, which volunteers to utilize, and to determine which response activities are appropriate for volunteer participation in any given response are the sole responsibilities of the designated incident commander or unified command.</p>

<li>
<p>The department is responsible for requiring joint large-scale, multiple plan equipment deployment drills of covered vessels to determine the adequacy of the owner's or operator's compliance with the contingency plan requirements of this chapter. The department must order at least one drill as outlined in this section every three years, which must address situations where oils, depending on their qualities, weathering, environmental factors, and method of discharge, may submerge or sink in water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drills required under this section must focus on, at a minimum, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The functional ability for multiple contingency plans to be simultaneously activated with the purpose of testing the ability for dedicated equipment and trained personnel cited in multiple contingency plans to be activated in a large scale spill; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The operational readiness during both the first six hours of a spill and, at the department's discretion, over multiple operational periods of response.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drills required under this section may be incorporated into other drill requirements under this chapter to avoid increasing the number of drills and equipment deployments otherwise required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each successful drill conducted under this section may be considered by the department as a drill of the underlying contingency plan and credit may be awarded to the plan holder accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall, when practicable, coordinate with applicable federal agencies, the state of Oregon, and the province of British Columbia to establish a drill incident command and to help ensure that lessons learned from the drills are evaluated with the goal of improving the underlying contingency plans.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department must approve an umbrella plan holder that covers vessels having a worst case discharge volume that exceeds the maximum volume if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department determines that the umbrella plan holder should be approved for a lower discharge volume;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vessel owner or operator provides documentation to the umbrella plan holder authorizing the umbrella plan holder to activate additional resources sufficient to meet the worst case discharge volume of the vessel; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department has previously approved a plan that provides access to the same resources identified in (3)(b) [(b) of this subsection] to meet the requirements of this chapter for worst case discharge volumes equal to or greater than the worst case discharge volume of the vessel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The umbrella plan holder must describe in the plan how the activation of additional resources will be implemented and provide the department the ability to review and inspect any documentation that the umbrella plan holder relies on to enroll a vessel with a worst case discharge that exceeds the plan's maximum volume.</p>
