<li>
<p>The legislature finds that there are factors unique to the relationship between a manufactured/mobile home tenant and a manufactured/mobile home community landlord. Once occupancy has commenced, the difficulty and expense in moving and relocating a manufactured/mobile home can affect the operation of market forces and lead to an inequality of the bargaining position of the parties. Once occupancy has commenced, a tenant may be subject to violations of the manufactured/mobile home landlord-tenant act without an adequate remedy at law. This chapter is created for the purpose of protecting the public, fostering fair and honest competition, and regulating the factors unique to the relationship between the manufactured/mobile home tenant and the manufactured/mobile home community landlord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that taking legal action against a manufactured/mobile home community landlord for violations of the manufactured/mobile home landlord-tenant act can be a costly and lengthy process, and that many people cannot afford to pursue a court process to vindicate statutory rights. Manufactured/mobile home community landlords will also benefit by having access to a process that resolves disputes quickly and efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide an equitable as well as a less costly and more efficient way for manufactured/mobile home tenants and manufactured/mobile home community landlords to resolve disputes, and to provide a mechanism for state authorities to quickly locate manufactured/mobile home community landlords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to authorize the department of revenue to register manufactured/mobile home communities and collect a registration fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to authorize the attorney general to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Produce and distribute educational materials regarding the manufactured/mobile home landlord-tenant act and the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program created in RCW 59.30.030;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administer the dispute resolution program by taking complaints, conducting investigations, making determinations, issuing fines and other penalties, and participating in administrative dispute resolutions, when necessary, when there are alleged violations of the manufactured/mobile home landlord-tenant act; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect and annually report upon data related to disputes and violations, and make recommendations on modifying chapter 59.20 RCW, to the appropriate committees of the legislature.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program is to provide manufactured/mobile home community landlords and tenants with a cost-effective and time-efficient process to resolve disputes regarding alleged violations of the manufactured/mobile home landlord-tenant act.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Inform the complainant of any notification requirements under RCW 59.20.080 for tenant violations or RCW 59.20.200 for landlord violations and encourage the complainant to appropriately notify the respondent of the complaint; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>After receiving a complaint under this chapter, the attorney general shall initiate the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program by investigating the alleged violations at its discretion and, if appropriate, facilitating negotiations between the complainant and the respondent.</p>

<li>
<p>If after an investigation the attorney general determines that an agreement cannot be negotiated between the parties, the attorney general shall make a written determination on whether a violation of chapter 59.20 RCW has occurred.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the attorney general finds by a written determination that a violation of chapter 59.20 RCW has occurred, the attorney general shall deliver a written notice of violation to the respondent who committed the violation by certified mail. The notice of violation must specify the violation, the corrective action required, the time within which the corrective action must be taken, the penalties including fines, other penalties, and actions that will result if corrective action is not taken within the specified time period, and the process for contesting the determination, fines, penalties, and other actions included in the notice of violation through an administrative hearing. The attorney general must deliver to the complainant a copy of the notice of violation by certified mail.</p>

<p>Corrective action must take place within fifteen business days of the respondent's receipt of a notice of violation, except as required otherwise by the attorney general, unless the respondent has submitted a timely request for an administrative hearing to contest the notice of violation as required under subsection (8) of this section. If a respondent, which includes either a landlord or a tenant, fails to take corrective action within the required time period and the attorney general has not received a timely request for an administrative hearing, the attorney general may impose a fine, up to a maximum of two hundred fifty dollars per violation per day, for each day that a violation remains uncorrected. The attorney general must consider the severity and duration of the violation and the violation's impact on other community residents when determining the appropriate amount of a fine or the appropriate penalty to impose on a respondent. If the respondent shows upon timely application to the attorney general that a good faith effort to comply with the corrective action requirements of the notice of violation has been made and that the corrective action has not been completed because of mitigating factors beyond the respondent's control, the attorney general may delay the imposition of a fine or penalty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attorney general may issue an order requiring the respondent, or its assignee or agent, to cease and desist from an unlawful practice and take affirmative actions that in the judgment of the attorney general will carry out the purposes of this chapter.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Refunds of rent increases, improper fees, charges, and assessments collected in violation of this chapter;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A fine or other penalty imposed under subsection (6) of this section; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order to cease and desist or an order to take affirmative actions under subsection (7) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The complainant or respondent must request an administrative hearing within fifteen business days of receipt of a notice of violation, notice of nonviolation, fine, other penalty, order, or action. If an administrative hearing is not requested within this time period, the notice of violation, notice of nonviolation, fine, other penalty, order, or action constitutes a final order of the attorney general and is not subject to review by any court or agency.</p>
<ol start="9">

<li>
<p>When the attorney general imposes a fine, refund, or other penalty against a respondent, the respondent may not seek any recovery or reimbursement of the fine, refund, or other penalty from a complainant or from other manufactured/mobile home tenants.</p>

<li>
<p>All receipts from the imposition of fines or other penalties collected under this section other than those due to a complainant must be deposited into the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program account created in RCW 59.30.070.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section is not exclusive and does not limit the right of landlords or tenants to take legal action against another party as provided in chapter 59.20 RCW or otherwise. Exhaustion of the administrative remedy provided in this chapter is not required before a landlord or tenants may bring a legal action. This section does not apply to unlawful detainer actions initiated under RCW 59.20.080 prior to the filing and service of an unlawful detainer court action; however, a tenant is not precluded from seeking relief under this chapter if the complaint claims the notice of termination violates RCW 59.20.080 prior to the filing and service of an unlawful detainer action.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An annual registration assessment of fifteen dollars for each manufactured/mobile home that is subject to chapter 59.20 RCW within a manufactured/mobile home community. Manufactured/mobile home community landlords may charge a maximum of five dollars of this assessment to tenants. Nine dollars of the registration assessment for each manufactured/mobile home must be deposited into the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program account created in RCW 59.30.070 to fund the costs associated with the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program. One dollar of the registration assessment must be deposited into the business license account created in RCW 19.02.210. The remaining five dollars of the registration assessment must be deposited into the manufactured/mobile home park relocation fund created in RCW 59.21.050. The annual registration assessment must be reviewed once each biennium by the department and the attorney general and may be adjusted to reasonably relate to the cost of administering this chapter. The registration assessment may not exceed fifteen dollars, but if the assessment is reduced, the portion allocated to the manufactured/mobile home dispute resolution program account, the business license account, and the manufactured/mobile home park relocation fund must be adjusted proportionately.</p>

<li>
<p>Initial registrations of manufactured/mobile home communities must be filed before November 1, 2007, or within three months of the availability of mobile home lots for rent within the community.

<li>
<p>Thirty days after sending late fee notices to a noncomplying landlord, the department may issue a warrant under RCW 59.30.090 for the unpaid registration assessment and delinquency fee. If a warrant is issued by the department under RCW 59.30.090, the department must add a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the unpaid registration assessment and delinquency fee, but not less than ten dollars. The warrant penalty must be deposited into the business license account created in RCW 19.02.210. Chapter 82.32 RCW applies to the collection of warrants issued under RCW 59.30.090.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration is effective on the date determined by the department, and the department must issue a registration number to each registered manufactured/mobile home community. The department must provide an expiration date, assigned by the department, to each manufactured/mobile home community who registers.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If any registration assessment or delinquency fee is not paid in full within thirty days after sending late fee notices to a noncomplying landlord, the department may issue a warrant in the amount of such unpaid sums, together with interest thereon from the date the warrant is issued until the date of payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest must be computed on a daily basis on the amount of outstanding registration assessment and delinquency fee imposed under RCW 59.30.050 at the rate as computed under RCW 82.32.050(2). The rate so computed must be adjusted on the first day of January of each year for use in computing interest for that calendar year. Interest must be deposited in the business license account created in RCW 19.02.210.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may file a copy of the warrant with the clerk of the superior court of any county of the state in which real or personal property of the owner of the manufactured/mobile home community may be found. The clerk is entitled to a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10). Upon filing, the clerk must enter in the judgment docket the name of the owner of the manufactured/mobile home community mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the registration assessment and delinquency fee, or portion thereof, and any increases and penalties for which the warrant is issued, and the date when the copy is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of the warrant so docketed becomes a lien upon the title to, and interest in, all real and personal property of the owner of the manufactured/mobile home community against whom the warrant is issued the same as a judgment in a civil case duly docketed in the office of the clerk. The warrant so docketed is sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the state in the manner provided by law in the case of judgments wholly or partially unsatisfied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lien is not superior to bona fide interests of third persons that had vested prior to the filing of the warrant. The phrase &quot;bona fide interests of third persons&quot; does not include any mortgage of real or personal property or any other credit transaction that results in the mortgagee or the holder of the security acting as trustee for unsecured creditors of the owner of the manufactured/mobile home community mentioned in the warrant who executed the chattel or real property mortgage or the document evidencing the credit transaction.</p>
