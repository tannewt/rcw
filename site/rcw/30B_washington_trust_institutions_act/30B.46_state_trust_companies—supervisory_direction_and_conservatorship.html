<li>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide expeditious methods for the department to exercise proper supervision over the safety and soundness of state trust companies in the interest of Washington state's fiduciary industry and the general public. To that end, this chapter prescribes a series of progressive corrective action measures available to the director, as necessary and in connection with the exercise of his or her examination authority, the ultimate object of which is to restore a state trust company to a state of safe and sound condition and practices and to prevent, if possible, involuntary dissolution of the state trust company under chapter 30B.44B RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order of progression, these corrective action measures include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The supervisory directive, which may be issued with the consent of a state trust company as a supervisory agreement or memorandum of understanding or without the state trust company's consent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The corrective action order, which may be issued with or without the consent of a state trust company; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order of conservatorship, which may be issued with or without the consent of a state trust company.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may issue and impose upon a state trust company, in lieu of or in addition to his or her authority to issue and serve a notice and statement of charges pursuant to chapter 30B.10 RCW, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A supervisory agreement or memorandum of understanding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A supervisory directive without the state trust company's consent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A corrective action order, with or without its consent; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order of conservatorship, with or without its consent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A supervisory agreement or memorandum of understanding, or corrective action order or order of conservatorship consented to by a state trust company, shall not be subject to review except upon a claim by the state trust company or other person with standing under RCW 34.05.530, made in good faith, that the terms and conditions of the supervisory agreement or memorandum of understanding, corrective action order, or order of conservatorship exceed the authority of the director under this title and that consent to the supervisory agreement or memorandum of understanding was unreasonably coerced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A supervisory directive issued and imposed without the consent of the state trust company shall not be subject to review except by petition for judicial review in the manner provided by the Washington administrative procedure act, RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598, inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A corrective action order or order of conservatorship issued and imposed against a state trust company without its consent shall be deemed an emergency order under RCW 30B.10.180, subject only to judicial review as permitted by RCW 30B.10.180.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No provision in this title shall preclude the director from issuing a corrective action order without having issued a supervisory directive, or issuing an order of conservatorship without having issued a supervisory directive or corrective action order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No provision in this title shall preclude the director from issuing an order for involuntary dissolution of a state trust company without first having issued corrective action measures if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Pursuant to RCW 30B.44B.005, the director has determined there is no reasonable likelihood that a state trust company can be restored to a safe and sound condition in the foreseeable future; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state trust company gives its consent pursuant to RCW 30B.44B.010.</p>

<li>
<p>If, upon examination or investigation, or at any other time, it appears to the director that a state trust company is in an unsafe condition and its condition is such as to render the continuance of its business, without the director's supervisory directive, harmful to the public or to its beneficiaries, shareholders, or trustors, then the director may either negotiate and enter into a supervisory agreement or memorandum of understanding with the state trust company, or issue and deliver a supervisory directive or corrective action order without its consent, the contents of which shall contain:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Notice to the state trust company of the director's supervisory determination; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A written list and description of the requirements necessary to abate the director's determination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If placed under a supervisory directive, with or without its consent, the state trust company shall comply with the director's lawful requirements as contained in the supervisory directive and within such time as provided in the supervisory directive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the state trust company fails to comply with the supervisory directive within the time provided, the director may issue and deliver to the state trust company, with or without its consent, a corrective action order or an order of conservatorship.</p>

<p>If the director determines that a state trust company has failed to comply with the lawful requirements imposed by such supervisory directive or corrective action order, the director may by order, with or without consent of the state trust company, appoint a conservator for the state trust company, who shall immediately take charge of such state trust company and all of its property, books, records, and effects.</p>

<p>During the pendency of the conservatorship, the conservator shall make such reports to the director from time to time as may be required by the director, and shall be empowered to take all necessary measures to preserve, protect, and recover any assets or property of such state trust company, including claims or causes of actions belonging to or which may be asserted by such state trust company, and to deal with the same in his or her own name as conservator, and shall be empowered to file, prosecute, and defend any suit and suits which have been filed or which may be filed by or against such state trust company that are deemed by the conservator to be necessary to protect all of the interested parties for a property affected thereby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director, an assistant director or other officer of the department, or an independent contractor appointed by the director may be appointed to serve as conservator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, after issuance of the order of conservatorship, the director determines, after consultation with the conservator, that the state trust company is in an unsafe and unsound condition and ought not to continue business, the director may proceed to give advance notice to and take possession of the state trust company for involuntary liquidation pursuant to chapter 30B.44B RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director, in his or her capacity as a conservator, or any other person appointed as conservator by the director, pursuant to this chapter is immune from criminal, civil, and administrative liability for any act done in good faith in the performance of the duties of conservator.</p>
