<p>An out-of-state trust institution that has, prior to July 28, 2019, obtained approval from the director under authority of Title 30 RCW, as it existed before January 5, 2015, or under authority of this title, as it existed prior to July 28, 2019, to engage in trust business in Washington state and has continuously since the date of such approval held itself out to the public as engaging in trust business in Washington state, shall be exempt from the requirement of notice to or obtaining approval from the director pursuant to chapter 30B.38 RCW.</p>

Authorization from the secretary of state to transact business in Washington state as a foreign corporation or foreign limited liability company is not by itself satisfactory evidence of such approval from the director.</p>
