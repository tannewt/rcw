<p>The legislature finds that the cost of medical care in general and hospital care in particular has risen dramatically in recent years, and that in 1981, such costs rose faster than in any year since World War II. The purpose of RCW 70.126.001 through * 70.126.050 is to support the provision of less expensive and more appropriate levels of care, home health care and hospice care, in order to avoid hospitalization or shorten hospital stays.</p>
