In order to effectively accomplish such purpose the department of social and health services, hereinafter called the department, is authorized and instructed and it shall be its duty to establish and administer facilities and a program of service for the discovery, care, education, hospitalization, treatment and training of educable persons afflicted with cerebral palsy, and to provide in connection therewith nursing, medical, surgical and corrective care, together with academic, occupational and related training. Such program shall extend to developing, extending and improving service for the discovery of such persons and for diagnostication and hospitalization and shall include cooperation with other agencies of the state charged with the administration of laws providing for any type of service or aid to persons with disabilities, and with the United States government through any appropriate agency or instrumentality in developing, extending and improving such service, program and facilities. Such facilities shall include field clinics, diagnosis and observation centers, boarding schools, special classes in day schools, research facilities and such other facilities as shall be required to render appropriate aid to such persons. Existing facilities, buildings, hospitals and equipment belonging to or operated by the state of Washington shall be made available for these purposes when use therefor does not conflict with the primary use of such existing facilities.
