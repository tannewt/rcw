<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Trauma is a severe health problem in the state of Washington and a major cause of death;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presently, trauma care is very limited in many parts of the state, and health care in rural areas is in transition with the danger that some communities will be without emergency medical care;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is in the best interest of the citizens of Washington state to establish an efficient and well-coordinated statewide emergency medical services and trauma care system to reduce costs and incidence of inappropriate and inadequate trauma care and emergency medical service and minimize the human suffering and costs associated with preventable mortality and morbidity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goals and objectives of an emergency medical services and trauma care system are to: (a) Pursue trauma prevention activities to decrease the incidence of trauma; (b) provide optimal care for the trauma victim; (c) prevent unnecessary death and disability from trauma and emergency illness; and (d) contain costs of trauma care and trauma system implementation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other parts of the United States where trauma care systems have failed and trauma care centers have closed, there is a direct relationship between such failures and closures and a lack of commitment to fair and equitable reimbursement for trauma care participating providers and system overhead costs.</p>
</li>

<p>Any hospital or health care facility that desires to be authorized to provide a designated trauma care service shall request designation from the department. Designation involves a contractual relationship between the state and a hospital or health care facility whereby each agrees to maintain a level of commitment and resources sufficient to meet responsibilities and standards required by the statewide emergency medical services and trauma care system plan. By January 1992, the department shall determine by rule the manner and form of such requests. Upon receiving a request, the department shall review the request to determine whether the hospital or health care facility is in compliance with standards for the trauma care service or services for which designation is desired. If requests are received from more than one hospital or health care facility within the same emergency medical planning and trauma care planning and service region, the department shall select the most qualified applicant or applicants to be selected through a competitive process. Any applicant not designated may request a hearing to review the decision.</p>
<p>Designations are valid for a period of three years and are renewable upon receipt of a request for renewal prior to expiration from the hospital or health care facility. When an authorization for designation is due for renewal other hospitals and health care facilities in the area may also apply and compete for designation. Regional emergency medical and trauma care councils shall be notified promptly of designated hospitals and health care facilities in their region so they may incorporate them into the regional plan as required by this chapter. The department may revoke or suspend the designation should it determine that the hospital or health care facility is substantially out of compliance with the standards and has refused or been unable to comply after a reasonable period of time has elapsed. The department shall promptly notify the regional emergency medical and trauma care planning and service region of suspensions or revocations. Any facility whose designation has been revoked or suspended may request a hearing to review the action by the department as provided for in chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
<p>As a part of the process to designate and renew the designation of hospitals authorized to provide level I, II, or III trauma care services or level I, II, and III pediatric trauma care services, the department shall contract for on-site reviews of such hospitals to determine compliance with required standards. The department may contract for on-site reviews of hospitals and health care facilities authorized to provide level IV or V trauma care services or level I, I-pediatric, II, or III trauma-related rehabilitative services to determine compliance with required standards. Members of on-site review teams and staff included in site visits are exempt from chapter 42.56 RCW. They may not divulge and cannot be subpoenaed to divulge information obtained or reports written pursuant to this section in any civil action, except, after in camera review, pursuant to a court order which provides for the protection of sensitive information of interested parties including the department: (1) In actions arising out of the department's designation of a hospital or health care facility pursuant to this section; (2) in actions arising out of the department's revocation or suspension of designation status of a hospital or health care facility under this section; or (3) in actions arising out of the restriction or revocation of the clinical or staff privileges of a health care provider as defined in RCW 7.70.020 (1) and (2), subject to any further restrictions on disclosure in RCW 4.24.250 that may apply. Information that identifies individual patients shall not be publicly disclosed without the patient's consent. When a facility requests designation for more than one service, the department may coordinate the joint consideration of such requests.</p>
<p>The department may establish fees to help defray the costs of this section, though such fees shall not be assessed to health care facilities authorized to provide level IV and V trauma care services.</p>
<p>This section shall not restrict the authority of a hospital or a health care provider licensed under Title 18 RCW to provide services which it has been authorized to provide by state law.</p>

<li>
<p>Any provider desiring to provide a verified prehospital trauma care service shall indicate on the licensing application how they meet the standards required for verification as a provider of this service. The department shall notify the regional emergency medical services and trauma care councils of the providers of verified trauma care services in their regions. The department may conduct on-site reviews of prehospital providers to assess compliance with the applicable standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the department determine that a prehospital provider is substantially out of compliance with the standards, the department shall notify the regional emergency medical services and trauma care council. If the failure of a prehospital provider to comply with the applicable standards results in the region being out of compliance with its regional plan, the council shall take such steps necessary to assure the region is brought into compliance within a reasonable period of time. The council may seek assistance and funding from the department and others to provide training or grants necessary to bring a prehospital provider into compliance. The council may appeal to the department for modification of the regional plan if it is unable to assure continued compliance with the regional plan. The department may authorize modification of the plan if such modifications meet the requirements of this chapter. The department may suspend or revoke the authorization of a prehospital provider to provide a verified prehospital service if the provider has refused or been unable to comply after a reasonable period of time has elapsed. The council shall be notified promptly of any revocations or suspensions. Any prehospital provider whose verification has been suspended or revoked may request a hearing to review the action by the department as provided for in chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may grant a variance from provisions of this section if the department determines: (a) That no detriment to public health and safety will result from the variance, and (b) compliance with provisions of this section will cause a reduction or loss of existing prehospital services. Variances may be granted for a period not to exceed one year. A variance may be renewed by the department. If a renewal is granted, a plan of compliance shall be prepared specifying steps necessary to bring a provider or region into compliance and expected date of compliance.</p>
