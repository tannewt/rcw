<p>The legislature finds that abusive patent litigation, and especially the assertion of bad faith infringement claims, can harm Washington's economy. A person or business that receives a demand asserting such claims faces the threat of expensive and protracted litigation and may determine that it has no choice but to settle and to pay a licensing fee, even if the claim is meritless. This is especially so for small and medium-sized entities and nonprofits lacking adequate resources to investigate and defend themselves against the infringement claims. Not only do bad faith patent infringement claims impose a significant burden on individual Washington businesses and other entities, they also undermine Washington's efforts to attract and nurture information technology and knowledge-based businesses. Resources expended to avoid the threat of bad faith litigation are no longer available to invest, develop and produce new products, expand, or hire new workers, thereby harming Washington's economy. Through this legislation, the legislature seeks to protect Washington's economy from abusive and bad faith assertions of patent infringement, while not interfering with federal law or legitimate patent enforcement actions.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any other factor the court determines to be relevant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in the demand letter or patent assertion may be used to move for declaratory judgment in underlying patent infringement litigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court may consider the following factors as evidence that a person has made an assertion of patent infringement in good faith:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The person has:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Engaged in reasonable analysis to establish a reasonable, good faith basis for believing the target has infringed the patent; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attempted to negotiate an appropriate remedy in a reasonable manner;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>

<p>The attorney general may bring an action in the name of the state, or as parens patriae on behalf of persons residing in the state, to enforce this chapter. For actions brought by the attorney general to enforce the provisions of this section, the legislature finds that the practices covered by this section are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. For actions brought by the attorney general to enforce this chapter, a violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for purposes of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
