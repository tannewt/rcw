<p>A manufacturer who sells a wheelchair to a consumer, either directly or through a wheelchair dealer, shall furnish the consumer with an express warranty for the wheelchair. The duration of the express warranty must be for at least one year after the first delivery of the wheelchair to the consumer.

<li>
<p>If a new wheelchair does not conform to an applicable express warranty and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, the wheelchair lessor, or any of the manufacturer's authorized wheelchair dealers and makes the wheelchair available for repair before one year after first delivery of the wheelchair to the consumer, the nonconformity must be repaired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, after a reasonable attempt to repair, the nonconformity is not repaired, the manufacturer shall do one of the following, whichever is appropriate:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

Under this subsection (2)(a)(ii), a reasonable allowance for use may not exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the full purchase price of the wheelchair by a fraction, the denominator of which is one thousand eight hundred twenty-five and the numerator of which is the number of days that the wheelchair was driven before the consumer first reported the nonconformity to the wheelchair dealer; or</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Under this subsection (2)(b), the current value of the written lease equals the total amount for which the lease obligates the consumer during the period of the lease remaining after its early termination, plus the wheelchair dealer's early termination costs and the value of the wheelchair at the lease expiration date if the lease sets forth the value, less the wheelchair lessor's early termination savings.</p>

<p>Under this subsection (2)(b), a reasonable allowance for use may not exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the total amount for which the written lease obligates the consumer by a fraction, the denominator of which is one thousand eight hundred twenty-five and the numerator of which is the number of days that the consumer drove the wheelchair before first reporting the nonconformity to the manufacturer, wheelchair lessor, or wheelchair dealer.</p>

<p>To receive a comparable new wheelchair or a refund due under subsection (2)(a) of this section, a consumer described under RCW 19.184.010(2) (a), (b), or (c) shall offer to the manufacturer of the wheelchair having the nonconformity to transfer possession of the wheelchair to the manufacturer. Within thirty days after the offer, the manufacturer shall provide the consumer with a comparable new wheelchair or a refund.
