<p>The legislature finds that there is a continued interest in mandating certain health coverages or offering of health coverages by health carriers; and that improved access to these health care services to segments of the population which desire them can provide beneficial social and health consequences which may be in the public interest.</p>
<p>The legislature finds further, however, that the cost ramifications of expanding health coverages is of continuing concern; and that the merits of a particular mandated benefit must be balanced against a variety of consequences which may go far beyond the immediate impact upon the cost of insurance coverage. The legislature hereby finds and declares that a systematic review of proposed mandated benefits, which explores all the ramifications of such proposed legislation, will assist the legislature in determining whether mandating a particular coverage or offering is in the public interest. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a procedure for the proposal, review, and determination of mandated benefit necessity.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Based on the availability of relevant information, the following criteria shall be used to assess the impact of proposed mandated benefits:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The social impact: (i) To what extent is the benefit generally utilized by a significant portion of the population? (ii) To what extent is the benefit already generally available? (iii) If the benefit is not generally available, to what extent has its unavailability resulted in persons not receiving needed services? (iv) If the benefit is not generally available, to what extent has its unavailability resulted in unreasonable financial hardship? (v) What is the level of public demand for the benefit? (vi) What is the level of interest of collective bargaining agents in negotiating privately for inclusion of this benefit in group contracts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financial impact: (i) To what extent will the benefit increase or decrease the cost of treatment or service? (ii) To what extent will the coverage increase the appropriate use of the benefit? (iii) To what extent will the benefit be a substitute for a more expensive benefit? (iv) To what extent will the benefit increase or decrease the administrative expenses of health carriers and the premium and administrative expenses of policyholders? (v) What will be the impact of this benefit on the total cost of health care services and on premiums for health coverage? (vi) What will be the impact of this benefit on costs for state purchased health care? (vii) What will be the impact of this benefit on affordability and access to coverage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence of health care service efficacy:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If a mandatory benefit of a specific service is sought, to what extent has there been conducted professionally accepted controlled trials demonstrating the health consequences of that service compared to no service or an alternative service?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a mandated benefit of a category of health care provider is sought, to what extent has there been conducted professionally accepted controlled trials demonstrating the health consequences achieved by the mandated benefit of this category of health care provider?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent will the mandated benefit enhance the general health status of the state residents?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall consider the availability of relevant information in assessing the completeness of the proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may supplement these criteria to reflect new relevant information or additional significant issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish, where appropriate, ad hoc panels composed of related experts, and representatives of carriers, consumers, providers, and purchasers to assist in the proposal review process. Ad hoc panel members shall serve without compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The health care authority shall evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of cost estimates associated with the proposed mandated benefit that are provided to the department by the proposer or other interested parties, and shall provide comment to the department. Interested parties may, in addition, submit data directly to the department.</p>
