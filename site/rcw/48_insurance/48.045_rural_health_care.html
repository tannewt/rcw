<p>The legislature finds that the residents of rural communities are having difficulties in locating and purchasing affordable health insurance. The legislature further finds that many rural communities have sufficient funds to pay for needed services, but those funds are being expended elsewhere causing insufficient funding of local health services. As part of the solution to this problem, rural communities need to be able to structure the financing of local health services to better serve local residents. The legislature further finds that as rural communities need well financed and organized health care, it is in the interest of residents of rural communities that existing unauthorized entities comply with appropriate fiscal solvency standards and consumer safeguards, and that those entities be given an opportunity to come into compliance with existing state laws.</p>
