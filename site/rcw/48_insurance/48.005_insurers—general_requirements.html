<p>The comparison of an insurer's total adjusted capital to any of its RBC levels is a regulatory tool that may indicate the need for possible corrective action with respect to the insurer, and is not a means to rank insurers generally.

However, if any materially false statement with respect to the comparison regarding an insurer's total adjusted capital to its RBC levels, or any of them, or an inappropriate comparison of any other amount to the insurer's RBC levels is published in any written publication and the insurer is able to demonstrate to the commissioner with substantial proof the falsity of such statement, or the inappropriateness, as the case may be, then the insurer may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false statement.</p>
