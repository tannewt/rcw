<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards for life insurance policy illustrations that will protect consumers and foster consumer education by providing illustration formats, prescribing standards to be followed when illustrations are used, and specifying the disclosures that are required in connection with illustrations. The goals of these standards are to ensure that illustrations do not mislead purchasers of life insurance and to make illustrations more understandable. Insurers will, as far as possible, eliminate the use of footnotes and caveates and define terms used in the illustration in language that would be understood by a typical person within the segment of the public to which the illustration is directed.</p>

<li>
<p>Each insurer marketing policies to which this chapter is applicable shall notify the commissioner whether a policy form is to be marketed with or without an illustration. For all policy forms being actively marketed on January 1, 1998, the insurer shall identify in writing those forms and whether or not an illustration will be used with them. For policy forms filed after January 1, 1998, the identification shall be made at the time of filing. Any previous identification may be changed by notice to the commissioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the insurer identifies a policy form as one to be marketed without an illustration, any use of an illustration for any policy using that form prior to the first policy anniversary is prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a policy form is identified by the insurer as one to be marketed with an illustration, a basic illustration prepared and delivered in accordance with this chapter is required, except that a basic illustration need not be provided to individual members of a group or to individuals insured under multiple lives coverage issued to a single applicant unless the coverage is marketed to these individuals. The illustration furnished an applicant for a group life insurance policy or policies issued to a single applicant on multiple lives may be either an individual or composite illustration representative of the coverage on the lives of members of the group or the multiple lives covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential enrollees of nonterm group life subject to this chapter shall be furnished a quotation with the enrollment materials. The quotation shall show potential policy values for sample ages and policy years on a guaranteed and nonguaranteed basis appropriate to the group and the coverage. This quotation is not considered an illustration for purposes of this chapter, but all information provided shall be consistent with the illustrated scale. A basic illustration shall be provided at delivery of the certificate to enrollees for nonterm group life who enroll for more than the minimum premium necessary to provide pure death benefit protection. In addition, the insurer shall make a basic illustration available to any nonterm group life enrollee who requests it.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The illustration shall be labeled with the date on which it was prepared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each page, including any explanatory notes or pages, shall be numbered and show its relationship to the total number of pages in the illustration (for example, the fourth page of a seven-page illustration shall be labeled &quot;page 4 of 7 pages&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assumed dates of payment receipt and benefit payout within a policy year shall be clearly identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the age of the proposed insured is shown as a component of the tabular detail, it shall be issue age plus the numbers of years the policy is assumed to have been in force.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assumed payments on which the illustrated benefits and values are based shall be identified as premium outlay or contract premium, as applicable. For policies that do not require a specific contract premium, the illustrated payments shall be identified as premium outlay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guaranteed death benefits and values available upon surrender, if any, for the illustrated premium outlay or contract premium shall be shown and clearly labeled guaranteed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the illustration shows any nonguaranteed elements, they cannot be based on a scale more favorable to the policy owner than the insurer's illustrated scale at any duration. These elements shall be clearly labeled nonguaranteed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guaranteed elements, if any, shall be shown before corresponding nonguaranteed elements and shall be specifically referred to on any page of an illustration that shows or describes only the nonguaranteed elements (for example, &quot;see page one for guaranteed elements&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The account or accumulation value of a policy, if shown, shall be identified by the name this value is given in the policy being illustrated and shown in close proximity to the corresponding value available upon surrender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value available upon surrender shall be identified by the name this value is given in the policy being illustrated and shall be the amount available to the policy owner in a lump sum after deduction of surrender charges, policy loans, and policy loan interest, as applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illustrations may show policy benefits and values in graphic or chart form in addition to the tabular form.</p>

<p>Actual results may be more or less favorable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the illustration shows that the premium payer may have the option to allow policy charges to be paid using nonguaranteed values, the illustration must clearly disclose that a charge continues to be required and that, depending on actual results, the premium payer may need to continue or resume premium outlays. Similar disclosure shall be made for premium outlay of lesser amounts or shorter durations than the contract premium. If a contract premium is due, the premium outlay display shall not be left blank or show zero unless accompanied by an asterisk or similar mark to draw attention to the fact that the policy is not paid up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the applicant plans to use dividends or policy values, guaranteed or nonguaranteed, to pay all or a portion of the contract premium or policy charges, or for any other purpose, the illustration may reflect those plans and the impact on future policy benefits and values.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A brief description of any policy features, riders, or options, guaranteed or nonguaranteed, shown in the basic illustration and the impact they may have on the benefits and values of the policy;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A statement containing in substance the following: &quot;This illustration assumes that the currently illustrated, nonguaranteed elements will continue unchanged for all years shown. This is not likely to occur, and actual results may be more or less favorable than those shown.&quot;</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Following the narrative summary, a basic illustration shall include a numeric summary of the death benefits and values and the premium outlay and contract premium, as applicable. For a policy that provides for a contract premium, the guaranteed death benefits and values shall be based on the contract premium. This summary shall be shown for at least policy years five, ten, and twenty and at age seventy, if applicable, on the three bases shown below.

<li>
<p>A statement to be signed and dated by the insurance producer or other authorized representative of the insurer reading as follows: &quot;I certify that this illustration has been presented to the applicant and that I have explained that any nonguaranteed elements illustrated are subject to change.

<li>
<p>Nonguaranteed elements may be shown if described in the contract. In the case of an illustration for a policy on which the insurer intends to credit terminal dividends, they may be shown if the insurer's current practice is to pay terminal dividends. If any nonguaranteed elements are shown, they must be shown at the same durations as the corresponding guaranteed elements, if any.
