<ol>
<li>
<p>An insurer, or the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, must, no later than June 1st of each calendar year, submit to the commissioner a corporate governance annual disclosure that contains the information described in RCW 48.195.030(2). If the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer must submit the report required by this section to the commissioner of the lead state for the insurance group, under the laws of the lead state, as determined by the procedures outlined in the most recent financial analysis handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The corporate governance annual disclosure must include a signature of the insurer or insurance group's chief executive officer or corporate secretary attesting to the best of the individual's belief and knowledge that the insurer has implemented the corporate governance practices and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An insurer not required to submit a corporate governance annual disclosure under this section must do so upon the commissioner's request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of completing the corporate governance annual disclosure, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at either (a) the ultimate controlling parent level, (b) an intermediate holding company level, or (c) the individual legal entity level, or any combination of (a) through (c) of this subsection, depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make the corporate governance annual disclosure at the level at which the insurer's or insurance group's risk appetite is determined, or at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors are coordinated and exercised, or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed. If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it must indicate which of the three criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in the level of reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The review of the corporate governance annual disclosure and any additional requests for information shall be made through the lead state as determined by the procedure within the most recent financial analysis handbook referenced in subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurers providing information substantially similar to the information required by this chapter in other documents provided to the commissioner, including proxy statements filed in conjunction with form B requirements, or other state or federal filings provided to the commissioner are not required to duplicate that information in the corporate governance annual disclosure, but are only required to cross-reference the document in which the information is included.</p>

<li>
<p>The insurer or insurance group has discretion over the responses to the corporate governance annual disclosure inquiries, provided the corporate governance annual disclosure contains the material information necessary to permit the commissioner to gain an understanding of the insurer's or insurance group's corporate governance structure, policies, and practices. The commissioner may request additional information that he or she deems material and necessary to provide the commissioner with a clear understanding of the corporate governance policies, the reporting or information system, or controls implementing those policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The corporate governance annual disclosure must be prepared consistent with the national association of insurance commissioners' corporate governance annual disclosure model rule which may be adopted by the commissioner. Documentation and supporting information must be maintained and made available upon examination or upon request of the commissioner.</p>
