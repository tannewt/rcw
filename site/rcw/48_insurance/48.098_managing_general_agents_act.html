<p>A managing general agent may not place business with an insurer unless there is in force a written contract between the managing general agent and the insurer that sets forth the responsibilities of each party and, where both parties share responsibility for a particular function, that specifies the division of the responsibilities, and that contains the following minimum provisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The insurer may terminate the contract for cause upon written notice to the managing general agent. The insurer may suspend the underwriting authority of the managing general agent during the pendency of a dispute regarding the cause for termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The managing general agent shall render accounts to the insurer detailing all transactions and remit all funds due under the contract to the insurer on not less than a monthly basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The managing general agent shall hold funds collected for the account of an insurer in a fiduciary capacity in an FDIC insured financial institution.

The managing general agent may retain no more than three months' estimated claims payments and allocated loss adjustment expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The managing general agent shall maintain separate records of business written for each insurer. The insurer has access to and the right to copy all accounts and records related to its business in a form usable by the insurer, and the commissioner has access to all books, bank accounts, and records of the managing general agent in a form usable to the commissioner. Those records must be retained according to the requirements of this title and rules adopted under it.</p>

<li>
<p>The managing general agent may not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Bind reinsurance or retrocessions on behalf of the insurer, except that the managing general agent may bind automatic reinsurance contracts under obligatory automatic agreements if the contract with the insurer contains reinsurance underwriting guidelines including, for both reinsurance assumed and ceded, a list of reinsurers with which the automatic agreements are in effect, the coverages and amounts or percentages that may be reinsured, and commission schedules;</p>
