<li>
<p>Shall be held legally and physically segregated from the other assets of the certificate of exemption holder;</p>

<p>Shall be invested in the same manner that persons of reasonable prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of a like enterprise, not in regard to speculating but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of their capital. Investments shall be of sufficient value, liquidity, and diversity to assure the insurer or institution's ability to meet its outstanding obligations; and</p>
