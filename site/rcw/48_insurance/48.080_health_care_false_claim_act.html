<p>The legislature finds and declares that the welfare of the citizens of this state is threatened by the spiraling increases in the cost of health care. It is further recognized that fraudulent health care claims contribute to these increases in health care costs. In recognition of these findings, it is declared that special attention must be directed at eliminating the unjustifiable costs of fraudulent health care claims by establishing specific penalties and deterrents. This chapter may be known and cited as &quot;the health care false claim act.&quot;</p>
