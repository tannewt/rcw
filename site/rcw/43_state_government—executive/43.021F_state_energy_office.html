<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the state needs to implement a comprehensive energy planning process that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Is based on high quality, unbiased analysis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engages public agencies and stakeholders in a thoughtful, deliberative process that creates a cohesive plan that earns sustained support of the public and organizations and institutions that will ultimately be responsible for implementation and execution of the plan; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishes policies and practices needed to ensure the effective implementation of the strategy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that energy drives the entire modern economy from petroleum for vehicles to electricity to light homes and power businesses. The legislature further finds that the nation and the world have started the transition to a clean energy economy, with significant improvements in energy efficiency and investments in new clean and renewable energy resources and technologies. The legislature further finds this transition may increase or decrease energy costs and efforts should be made to mitigate cost increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that it is the continuing purpose of state government, consistent with other essential considerations of state policy, to foster wise and efficient energy use and to promote energy self-sufficiency through the use of indigenous and renewable energy sources, consistent with the promotion of reliable energy sources, the general welfare, and the protection of environmental quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further declares that a successful state energy strategy must balance three goals to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Maintain competitive energy prices that are fair and reasonable for consumers and businesses and support our state's continued economic success;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase competitiveness by fostering a clean energy economy and jobs through business and workforce development; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet the state's obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

In developing the guidance, the director must consult with agencies with primary responsibilities for permitting and management of marine waters and bedlands, including the departments of natural resources, ecology, transportation, and fish and wildlife, and the state parks and recreation commission, the Puget Sound partnership, and the energy facility site evaluation council. The director must also consult and incorporate relevant information from the regional activities related to renewable energy siting in marine waters, including those under the west coast governors' agreement on ocean health.</p>

<p>The western interstate nuclear compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by the state of Washington as a party, and is in full force and effect between the state and any other states joining therein in accordance with the terms of the compact, which compact is substantially as follows:</p>
<p>ARTICLE I. POLICY AND PURPOSE</p>
<p>The party states recognize that the proper employment of scientific and technological discoveries and advances in nuclear and related fields and direct and collateral application and adaptation of processes and techniques developed in connection therewith, properly correlated with the other resources of the region, can assist substantially in the industrial progress of the West and the further development of the economy of the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from nuclear and related scientific or technological resources, facilities and skills requires systematic encouragement, guidance, assistance, and promotion from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort in nuclear and related fields, to enhance the economy of the West and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people.</p>
