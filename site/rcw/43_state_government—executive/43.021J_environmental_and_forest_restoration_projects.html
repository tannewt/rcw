<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the long-term health of the economy of Washington state depends on the sustainable management of its natural resources. Washington's forests, estuaries, waterways, and watersheds provide a livelihood for thousands of citizens of Washington state and millions of dollars of income and tax revenues every year from forests, fisheries, shellfisheries, recreation, tourism, and other water-dependent industries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the livelihoods and revenues produced by Washington's forests, estuaries, waterways, and watersheds would be enhanced by immediate investments in clean water infrastructure and habitat restoration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that an insufficiency in financial resources, especially in timber-dependent communities, has resulted in investments in clean water and habitat restoration too low to ensure the long-term economic and environmental health of Washington's forests, estuaries, waterways, and watersheds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that unemployed workers and Washington's economically distressed communities, especially timber-dependent areas, can benefit from opportunities for employment in environmental restoration projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature therefore declares that immediate investments in a variety of environmental restoration projects, based on sound principles of watershed management and environmental and forest restoration, are necessary to rehabilitate damaged watersheds and to assist dislocated workers and the unemployed gain job skills necessary for long-term employment.</p>

<p>It is the intent of this chapter to provide financial resources to make substantial progress toward: (a) Implementing the Puget Sound water quality management plan and other watershed-based management strategies and plans; (b) ameliorating degradation to watersheds; and (c) keeping and creating stable, environmentally sound, good wage employment in Washington state. The legislature intends that employment under this chapter is not to result in the displacement or partial displacement, whether by the reduction of hours of nonovertime work, wages, or other employment benefits, of currently employed workers, including but not limited to state civil service employees, or of currently or normally contracted services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Implement clean water, forest, and habitat restoration projects that will produce measurable improvements in water and habitat quality, that rate highly when existing environmental ranking systems are applied, and that provide economic stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate the coordination and consistency of federal, state, tribal, local, and private water and habitat protection and enhancement programs in the state's watersheds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fund necessary projects for which a public planning process has been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide immediate funding to create jobs and training for environmental restoration and enhancement jobs for unemployed workers and displaced workers in impact areas, especially rural natural resources-dependent communities.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter &quot;impact areas&quot; means: (a) Distressed counties as defined in *RCW 43.168.020; and (b) areas that the task force determines are likely to experience dislocations in the near future from downturns in natural resource-based industries.</p>

<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter, &quot;high-risk youth&quot; means youth eligible for Washington conservation corps programs under chapter 43.220 RCW or Washington service corps programs under chapter 50.65 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter, &quot;dislocated forest products worker&quot; has the meaning set forth in **RCW 50.70.010.</p>

<li>
<p>Only individuals who have entered training or employment provided by the *environmental and forest restoration account, and whose employment or training under such account was not considered covered under chapter 50.04 RCW, shall be allowed the special benefit provisions of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application for initial determination made under this chapter must be filed in writing with the employment security department within twenty-six weeks following the week in which the individual commenced employment or training obtained as a result of this chapter. Notice from the individual, from the employing entity, or notice of hire from employment security department administrative records shall satisfy this requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of this chapter, a special base year is established for an individual consisting of the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters, or if a benefit year is not established using the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters as the base year, the last four completed calendar quarters immediately prior to the first day of the calendar week in which the individual began employment or training provided by the *environmental and forest restoration account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A special individual benefit year is established consisting of the entire period of training or employment provided by the *environmental and forest restoration account and a fifty-two consecutive week period commencing with the first day of the calendar week in which the individual last participated in such employment or training. No special benefit year shall have a duration in excess of three hundred twelve calendar weeks. Such special benefit year will not be established unless the criteria contained in RCW 50.04.030 has been met, except that an individual meeting the requirements of this chapter and who has an unexpired benefit year established which would overlap the special benefit year may elect to establish a special benefit year under this chapter, notwithstanding the provisions in RCW 50.04.030 relating to establishment of a subsequent benefit year, and RCW 50.40.010 relating to waiver of rights. Such unexpired benefit year shall be terminated with the beginning of the special benefit year if the individual elects to establish a special benefit year under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual's weekly benefit amount and maximum amount payable during the special benefit year shall be governed by the provisions contained in RCW 50.20.120. The individual's basic and continuing right to benefits shall be governed by the general laws and rules relating to the payment of unemployment compensation benefits to the extent that they are not in conflict with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that wages, hours, or weeks worked during the special base year may have been used in computation of a prior valid claim for unemployment compensation shall not affect a claim for benefits made under the provisions of this chapter. However, wages, hours, and weeks worked used in computing entitlement on a claim filed under this chapter shall not be available or used for establishing entitlement or amount of benefits in any succeeding benefit year.</p>

<p>Benefits paid to an individual filing under the provisions of this section shall not be charged to the experience rating account of any contribution paying employer.</p>
