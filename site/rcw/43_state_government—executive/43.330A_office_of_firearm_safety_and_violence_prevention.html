</li>
<li>
<p>Program grants shall be used to support, expand, and replicate evidence-based violence reduction initiatives, including hospital-based violence intervention programs, evidence-based street outreach programs, and focused deterrence strategies, that seek to interrupt the cycles of violence, victimization, and retaliation in order to reduce the incidence of firearm violence. These initiatives must be primarily focused on providing violence intervention services to the small segment of the population that is identified as having the highest risk of perpetrating or being victimized by firearm violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program grants shall be made on a competitive basis to cities that are disproportionately impacted by violence, to law enforcement agencies in those cities, and to community-based organizations that serve the residents of those cities.

</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence indicating that the proposed firearm violence reduction initiative would likely reduce the incidence of firearm violence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In awarding program grants, the office shall give preference to applicants whose grant proposals demonstrate the greatest likelihood of reducing firearm violence in the applicant's community, without contributing to mass incarceration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each city that receives a program grant shall distribute no less than fifty percent of the grant funds to one or more of any of the following types of entities:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Community-based organizations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indian tribes and tribal organizations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
