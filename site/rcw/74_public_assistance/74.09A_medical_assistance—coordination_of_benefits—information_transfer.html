<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Simplification in the administration of payment of health benefits is important for the state, providers, and health insurers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state, providers, and health insurers should take advantage of all opportunities to streamline operations through automation and the use of common computer standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is in the best interests of the state, providers, and health insurers to identify all third parties that are obligated to cover the cost of health care coverage of joint beneficiaries; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health insurers, as a condition of doing business in Washington, must increase their effort to share information with the authority and accept the authority's timely claims consistent with 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the legislature declares that to improve the coordination of benefits between the health care authority and health insurers to ensure that medical insurance benefits are properly utilized, a transfer of information between the authority and health insurers should be instituted, and the process for submitting requests for information and claims should be simplified.</p>
