<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washington state is uniquely positioned as a gateway to the global economy. As the most trade-dependent state in the nation, per capita, Washington's economy is highly dependent on an efficient multimodal transportation network in order to remain competitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vitality of the state's economy is placed at risk by growing traffic congestion that impedes the safe and efficient movement of goods. The absence of a comprehensive and coordinated state policy that facilitates freight movements to local, national, and international markets limits trade opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freight corridors that serve international and domestic interstate and intrastate trade, and those freight corridors that enhance the state's competitive position through regional and global gateways are strategically important. In many instances, movement of freight on these corridors is diminished by: Barriers that block or delay access to intermodal facilities where freight is transferred from one mode of transport to another; conflicts between rail and road traffic; constraints on rail capacity; highway capacity constraints, congestion, and condition; waterway system depths that affect capacity; and institutional, regulatory, and operational barriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapidly escalating population growth is placing an added burden on streets, roads, and highways that serve as freight corridors. Community benefits from economic activity associated with freight movement often conflict with community concerns over safety, mobility, [and] environmental quality. Efforts to minimize community impacts in areas of high freight movements that encourage the active participation of communities in the early stages of proposed public and private infrastructure investments will facilitate needed freight mobility improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ownership of the freight mobility network is fragmented and spread across various public jurisdictions, private companies, and state and national borders. Transportation projects have grown in complexity and size, requiring more resources and longer implementation time frames. Currently, there is no comprehensive and integrated framework for planning the freight mobility needs of public and private stakeholders in the freight transportation system. A coordinated planning process should identify new infrastructure investments that are integrated by public and private planning bodies into a multimodal and multijurisdictional network in all areas of the state, urban and rural, east and west. The state should integrate freight mobility goals with state policy on related issues such as economic development, growth management, and environmental management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State investment in projects that enhance or mitigate freight movements, should pay special attention to solutions that utilize a corridor solution to address freight mobility issues with important transportation and economic impacts beyond any local area. The corridor approach builds partnerships and fosters coordinated planning among jurisdictions and the public and private sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the policy of the state of Washington that limited public transportation funding and competition between freight and general mobility improvements for the same fund sources require strategic, prioritized freight investments that reduce barriers to freight movement, maximize cost-effectiveness, yield a return on the state's investment, require complementary investments by public and private interests, and solve regional freight mobility problems. State financial assistance for freight mobility projects must leverage other funds from all potential partners and sources, including federal, county, city, port district, and private capital.</p>

<p>Review and evaluate project applications based on criteria established under this section, and prioritize and select projects comprising a portfolio to be funded in part with grants from state funds appropriated for the freight mobility strategic investment program. In determining the appropriate level of state funding for a project, the board shall ensure that state funds are allocated to leverage the greatest amount of partnership funding possible. The board shall ensure that projects included in the portfolio are not more appropriately funded with other federal, state, or local government funding mechanisms or programs. The board shall reject those projects that appear to improve overall general mobility with limited enhancement for freight mobility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The board shall provide periodic progress reports on its activities to the office of financial management and the senate and house transportation committees.</p>

<li>
<p>The board may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Accept from any state or federal agency, loans or grants for the financing of any transportation project and enter into agreements with any such agency concerning the loans or grants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide technical assistance to project applicants;</p>

<p>Accept any gifts, grants, or loans of funds, property, or financial, or other aid in any form from any other source on any terms and conditions which are not in conflict with this chapter;</p>

<p>Adopt rules under chapter 34.05 RCW as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do all things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers expressly granted or implied under this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall designate strategic freight corridors within the state. The board shall update the list of designated strategic corridors not less than every two years, and shall establish a method of collecting and verifying data, including information on city and county-owned roadways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall utilize threshold project eligibility criteria that, at a minimum, includes the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The project must be on a strategic freight corridor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project must meet one of the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>It is primarily aimed at reducing identified barriers to freight movement with only incidental benefits to general or personal mobility; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is primarily aimed at increasing capacity for the movement of freight with only incidental benefits to general or personal mobility; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is primarily aimed at mitigating the impact on communities of increasing freight movement, including roadway/railway conflicts; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project must have a total public benefit/total public cost ratio of equal to or greater than one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>From June 11, 1998, through the biennium ending June 30, 2001, the board shall use the multicriteria analysis and scoring framework for evaluating and ranking eligible freight mobility and freight mitigation projects developed by the freight mobility project prioritization committee and contained in the January 16, 1998, report entitled &quot;Project Eligibility, Priority and Selection Process for a Strategic Freight Investment Program.&quot; The prioritization process shall measure the degree to which projects address important program objectives and shall generate a project score that reflects a project's priority compared to other projects. The board shall assign scoring points to each criterion that indicate the relative importance of the criterion in the overall determination of project priority. After June 30, 2001, the board may supplement and refine the initial project priority criteria and scoring framework developed by the freight mobility project prioritization committee as expertise and experience is gained in administering the freight mobility program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that each freight mobility project contained in the project portfolio approved by the board utilize the greatest amount of nonstate funding possible. The board shall adopt rules that give preference to projects that contain the greatest levels of financial participation from nonprogram fund sources. The board shall consider twenty percent as the minimum partnership contribution, but shall also ensure that there are provisions allowing exceptions for projects that are located in areas where minimal local funding capacity exists or where the magnitude of the project makes the adopted partnership contribution financially unfeasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall develop and recommend policies that address operational improvements that primarily benefit and enhance freight movement, including, but not limited to, policies that reduce congestion in truck lanes at border crossings and weigh stations and provide for access to ports during nonpeak hours.</p>
