<p>It is hereby declared that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Milk is a necessary article of food for human consumption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The production, distribution, and maintenance of an adequate supply of healthful milk of proper chemical and physical content, free from contamination, is vital to the public health and welfare;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the policy of the state to promote, foster, and encourage the intelligent production and orderly marketing of adequate supplies of pure and wholesome milk and milk products necessary to its citizens, to promote competitive prices, and to eliminate economic waste, destructive trade practices, and improper accounting for milk purchased from producers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economic factors concerning the production, marketing, and sale of milk in the state may not be accurately reflected in federal programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conditions within the milk industry of this state are such that it may be necessary to establish marketing areas wherein pricing and pooling arrangements between producers are necessary, and for that purpose the director shall have the administrative authority, with such additional duties as are herein prescribed, after investigations and public hearings, to prescribe such marketing areas and modify the same when advisable or necessary.</p>

<p>The purposes of this chapter are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Authorize and enable the director to prescribe marketing areas and to establish pricing and pooling arrangements which are necessary to prevent disorderly marketing of milk due to varying factors of costs of production, health regulations, transportation, and other factors in said marketing areas of this state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorize and enable the director to formulate marketing plans subject to the provisions of this chapter, in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, which provide for pricing and pooling arrangements and declare such plans in effect for any marketing area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide funds for administration and enforcement of this chapter by assessments to be paid by producers.</p>

<li>
<p>In establishing a minimum milk price or a formula to determine a minimum milk price, as provided under RCW 15.35.060 and 15.35.100, the director shall, in addition to other appropriate criteria, consider the:</p>

<p>Cost of producing fluid milk for human consumption;</p>

<p>Transportation costs;</p>

<p>Alternative enterprises available to producers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economic impact on milk dealers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A milk dealer who believes that actual competition from outside the marketing area is having a significant economic impact on that milk dealer, may petition the director for a public hearing on an expedited basis to consider whether the minimum milk price in the market plan should be changed relative to the milk price to a competitor located outside the state plus transportation costs for that competitor to compete with the petitioning milk dealer.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To be considered, the petition must identify the specific action requested, and must be accompanied by a statement summarizing the facts and evidence that would be provided at a public hearing by or on behalf of the petitioner to support the need for the requested action, including an identification of circumstances that have changed since the last rule-making proceeding at which the minimum price was established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within twenty-one days of receiving the petition, the director shall either:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Adopt rules on an emergency basis, in accordance with RCW 34.05.350;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File, and distribute to all milk dealers and other interested parties, notice that a hearing will be held within sixty days of receiving the petition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise the petitioner in writing that the request for rule making is denied, and explain the reasons for the denial; or</p>

<li>
<p>Advise the petitioner in writing that the petition provides insufficient information from which to find that rule making should be initiated, and request that the petition be resubmitted with additional information.</p>

In conducting hearings on rules proposed for adoption under this subsection, the director shall invite public comment on whether milk regulation similar to the market area pooling plan proposed in the rules exists in neighboring states and whether a lack of such milk regulation in neighboring states would render such a market area pooling plan in this state ineffective or impractical.</p>

In such a case, a market area pooling plan shall not be established in the market area under subsection (3) of this section based upon the referendum that precipitated the hearings.</p>

<p>If such a person's sales of milk in fluid form subsequent to the adoption of the plan increases such that those sales in any year are more than fifty percent greater than the sales of milk in fluid form from the producer facilities during any of the previous five years, RCW 15.35.310(1) does not apply to that person with regard to that plan. Such a producer-dealer shall be a fully regulated producer under such an approved plan and shall receive a quota which is not less than the producer-dealer's sales of milk in fluid form during the reference period used by the director in determining quotas for producers.

Such initial quotas shall be determined by the department after due notice and the opportunity for a hearing as provided in chapter 34.05 RCW. In making this determination, consideration shall be given to a history of the producer's production record. In no case shall a producer-dealer receive as a quota an amount which is less than his or her fluid milk sales for the reference period used by the director in determining quotas for other producers.</p>

<p>In any system of establishing quotas, provision shall be made for new producers to qualify for allocation of quota in a reasonable proportion and for old and new producers to participate in any new increase in available quota in a reasonable proportion.
