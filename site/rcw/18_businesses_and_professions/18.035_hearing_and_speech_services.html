</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising a particular model, type, or kind of hearing instrument for sale which purchasers or prospective purchasers responding to the advertisement cannot purchase or are dissuaded from purchasing and where it is established that the purpose of the advertisement is to obtain prospects for the sale of a different model, type, or kind than that advertised;</p>

<li>
<p>Whenever any of the following conditions are found or should have been found to exist either from observations by the licensee or interim permit holder or on the basis of information furnished by the prospective hearing instrument user prior to fitting and dispensing a hearing instrument to any such prospective hearing instrument user, failing to advise that prospective hearing instrument user in writing that the user should first consult a licensed physician specializing in diseases of the ear or if no such licensed physician is available in the community then to any duly licensed physician:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>Visible congenital or traumatic deformity of the ear, including perforation of the eardrum;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Pain or discomfort in the ear; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other conditions that the board may by rule establish. It is a violation of this subsection for any licensee or that licensee's employees and putative agents upon making such required referral for medical opinion to in any manner whatsoever disparage or discourage a prospective hearing instrument user from seeking such medical opinion prior to the fitting and dispensing of a hearing instrument. No such referral for medical opinion need be made by any licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder in the instance of replacement only of a hearing instrument which has been lost or damaged beyond repair within twelve months of the date of purchase. The licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder or their employees or putative agents shall obtain a signed statement from the hearing instrument user documenting the waiver of medical clearance and the waiver shall inform the prospective user that signing the waiver is not in the user's best health interest: PROVIDED, That the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder shall maintain a copy of either the physician's statement showing that the prospective hearing instrument user has had a medical evaluation within the previous six months or the statement waiving medical evaluation, for a period of three years after the purchaser's receipt of a hearing instrument. Nothing in this section required to be performed by a licensee or interim permit holder shall mean that the licensee or interim permit holder is engaged in the diagnosis of illness or the practice of medicine or any other activity prohibited under the laws of this state;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Fitting and dispensing a hearing instrument to any person under eighteen years of age who has not been examined by an audiologist who holds at least a master's degree in audiology for recommendations during the previous six months, without first advising such person or his or her parents or guardian in writing that he or she should first consult an audiologist who holds at least a master's degree in audiology, except in cases of hearing instruments replaced within twelve months of their purchase;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representing that the services or advice of a person licensed to practice medicine and surgery under chapter 18.71 RCW or osteopathic medicine and surgery under chapter 18.57 RCW or of a clinical audiologist will be used or made available in the selection, fitting, adjustment, maintenance, or repair of hearing instruments when that is not true, or using the word &quot;doctor,&quot; &quot;clinic,&quot; or other like words, abbreviations, or symbols which tend to connote a medical or osteopathic medicine and surgery profession when such use is not accurate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permitting another to use his or her license or interim permit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stating or implying that the use of any hearing instrument will restore normal hearing, preserve hearing, prevent or retard progression of a hearing impairment, or any other false, misleading, or medically or audiologically unsupportable claim regarding the efficiency of a hearing instrument;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representing or implying that a hearing instrument is or will be &quot;custom-made,&quot; &quot;made to order,&quot; &quot;prescription made,&quot; or in any other sense specially fabricated for an individual when that is not the case; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directly or indirectly offering, giving, permitting, or causing to be given, money or anything of value to any person who advised another in a professional capacity as an inducement to influence that person, or to have that person influence others to purchase or contract to purchase any product sold or offered for sale by the hearing aid specialist, audiologist, or interim permit holder, or to influence any person to refrain from dealing in the products of competitors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging in any unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition in trade within the meaning of RCW 19.86.020.</p>

<p>In addition to any other rights and remedies a purchaser may have, the purchaser of a hearing instrument shall have the right to rescind the transaction for other than the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder's breach if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The purchaser, for reasonable cause, returns the hearing instrument or holds it at the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder's disposal, if the hearing instrument is in its original condition less normal wear and tear. &quot;Reasonable cause&quot; shall be defined by the board but shall not include a mere change of mind on the part of the purchaser or a change of mind related to cosmetic concerns of the purchaser about wearing a hearing instrument; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purchaser sends notice of the cancellation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the establishment employing the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder at the time the hearing instrument was originally purchased, and the notice is posted not later than thirty days following the date of delivery, but the purchaser and the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder may extend the deadline for posting of the notice of rescission by mutual, written agreement. In the event the hearing instrument develops a problem which qualifies as a reasonable cause for recision or which prevents the purchaser from evaluating the hearing instrument, and the purchaser notifies the establishment employing the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder of the problem during the thirty days following the date of delivery and documents such notification, the deadline for posting the notice of rescission shall be extended by an equal number of days as those between the date of the notification of the problem to the date of notification of availability for redeliveries. Where the hearing instrument is returned to the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder for any inspection for modification or repair, and the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder has notified the purchaser that the hearing instrument is available for redelivery, and where the purchaser has not responded by either taking possession of the hearing instrument or instructing the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder to forward it to the purchaser, then the deadline for giving notice of the recision shall extend no more than seven working days after this notice of availability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the transaction is rescinded under this section or as otherwise provided by law and the hearing instrument is returned to the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder, the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder shall refund to the purchaser any payments or deposits for that hearing instrument. However, the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder may retain, for each hearing instrument, fifteen percent of the total purchase price or one hundred twenty-five dollars, whichever is less. After December 31, 1996, the recision amount shall be determined by the board. The licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder shall also return any goods traded in contemplation of the sale, less any costs incurred by the licensed hearing aid specialist, licensed audiologist, or interim permit holder in making those goods ready for resale. The refund shall be made within ten business days after the rescission. The buyer shall incur no additional liability for such rescission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the purchaser shall have recourse against the bond held by the establishment entering into a purchase agreement with the buyer, as provided by RCW 18.35.240.</p>
