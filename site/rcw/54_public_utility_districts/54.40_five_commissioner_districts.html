The petition must be signed by a number of registered voters of the district equal to at least ten percent of the number of registered voters in the district who voted at the last general election and include each signer's residence address.</p>
<p>The petition shall be filed with the county auditor for verification of the validity of the signatures.

No signature may be withdrawn after the petition has been filed.</p>
<p>If the petition, including these additional signatures if any, is found sufficient, the county auditor shall certify its sufficiency to the public utility district and if the commissioners of the public utility district had certified to the county auditor the eligibility of the district for reclassification as provided in this chapter, the county auditor shall submit to the voters of the district the question of whether the district shall become a five commissioner district. The election shall be held at the next state general election occurring sixty or more days after the petition was certified as having sufficient valid signatures.</p>
