<p>The legislature recognizes that the number of children who have developmental disabilities along with intense behaviors is increasing, and more families are seeking out-of-home placement for their children.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to create services and to develop supports for these children, family members, and others involved in the children's lives to avoid disruption to families and eliminate the need for out-of-home placement.</p>
<p>The legislature directs the department to maintain a federal waiver through which services may be provided to allow children with developmental disabilities and intense behaviors to maintain permanent and stable familial relationships. The legislature intends for these services to be locally based and offered as early as possible to avoid family disruption and out-of-home placement.</p>
