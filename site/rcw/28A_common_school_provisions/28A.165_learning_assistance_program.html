<p>While the state allocations for the learning assistance program under this chapter are intended to be flexible dollars within the control of the public school and school district, this local control must be balanced with local accountability for improvement in student achievement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School district boards of directors must budget and expend the appropriations for the learning assistance program, under RCW 28A.165.005 through 28A.165.065, using the framework of the Washington integrated student supports protocol, established under RCW 28A.300.139.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A district may use up to 15 percent of the district's learning assistance program allocation to deliver academic, nonacademic, and social-emotional supports and services to students through partnerships with community-based or other out-of-school organizations in accordance with RCW 28A.300.139. Any agreement entered into by a school district and a community partner in accordance with RCW 28A.300.139 must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Specify that learning assistance program funds may be used only to provide direct supports and services to students;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearly identify the academic, nonacademic, or social-emotional supports and services that will be made available to students by the community partner and how those supports and services align to the needs of the students as identified in the student-level needs assessment required by RCW 28A.300.139; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the in-school supports that will be reinforced by the supports and services provided by the community partner to promote student progress towards meeting academic standards.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The funds for the learning assistance program shall be appropriated in accordance with RCW 28A.150.260 and the omnibus appropriations act. The distribution formula is for school district allocation purposes only, except as provided in RCW 28A.150.260(10)(a)(ii), but all funds appropriated for the learning assistance program must be expended for the purposes of RCW 28A.165.005 through 28A.165.065.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A district's high poverty-based allocation is generated by its qualifying schools as defined in RCW 28A.150.260(10) and must be expended by the district for those schools. This funding must supplement and not supplant the district's expenditures under this chapter for those schools.</p>

<p>To ensure that school districts are meeting the requirements of this chapter, the superintendent of public instruction shall monitor learning assistance programs using, at minimum, data reported as required under RCW 28A.165.100, no less than once every four years. The primary purpose of program monitoring is to evaluate the effectiveness of a school district's allocation and expenditure of resources and monitor school district fidelity in implementing best practices using the framework of the Washington integrated student supports protocol, established under RCW 28A.300.139. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may provide technical assistance to school districts to improve the effectiveness of a learning assistance program.</p>
