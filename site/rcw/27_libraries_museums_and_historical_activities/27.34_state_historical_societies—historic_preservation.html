</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A capital grant award may not exceed fifty thousand dollars, adjusted biennially for inflation. The department may not require applicants to provide matching funds.</p>

</li>
<li>

When evaluating and prioritizing projects, the committee shall consider the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the proposed project will result in lower costs of maintenance and operations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relative percentage of military burials in the cemetery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conditions in this subsection must be met by recipients of funding in order to satisfy the public benefit requirements of the historic cemetery preservation capital grant program.</p>

<li>
