<p>When used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>
<p>The term &quot;vocational education&quot; means a planned series of learning experiences, the specific objective of which is to prepare individuals for gainful employment as semiskilled or skilled workers or technicians or subprofessionals in recognized occupations and in new and emerging occupations, but shall not mean programs the primary characteristic of which is repetitive work for the purpose of production, including the correctional industries program. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the department of corrections from identifying and establishing trade advisory or apprenticeship committees to advise them on correctional industries work programs.</p>
