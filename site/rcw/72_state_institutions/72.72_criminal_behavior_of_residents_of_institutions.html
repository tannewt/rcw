<p>The legislature finds that political subdivisions in which state institutions are located incur a disproportionate share of the criminal justice costs due to criminal behavior of the residents of such institutions. To redress this inequity, it shall be the policy of the state of Washington to reimburse political subdivisions which have incurred such costs.</p>
