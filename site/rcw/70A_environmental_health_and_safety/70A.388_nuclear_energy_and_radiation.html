<p>It is the policy of the state of Washington in furtherance of its responsibility to protect the public health and safety and to encourage, insofar as consistent with this responsibility, the industrial and economic growth of the state and to institute and maintain a regulatory and inspection program for sources and uses of ionizing radiation so as to provide for (1) compatibility with the standards and regulatory programs of the federal government, (2) a single, effective system of regulation within the state, and (3) a system consonant insofar as possible with those of other states.</p>

The agency may at any time after the filing of the application, and before the expiration of the license, require further written statements and shall make such inspections as the agency deems necessary in order to determine whether the license should be granted or denied or whether the license should be modified, suspended, or revoked. In no event shall the agency grant a specific license to any applicant who has never possessed a specific license issued by a recognized state or federal authority until the agency has conducted an inspection which insures that the applicant can meet the rules, regulations and standards adopted pursuant to this chapter.

The incorporated city or town, through the official or employee selected by it, or the county legislative authority or the official or employee selected by it, shall have the right to file with the agency within twenty days after date of transmittal of such notice, written objections against the applicant or against the activity for which the license is sought, and shall include with such objections a statement of all facts upon which such objections are based, and in case written objections are filed, may request and the agency may in its discretion hold a formal hearing under chapter 34.05 RCW. Upon the granting of a license under this section the agency shall send a duplicate of the license or written notification to the chief executive officer of the incorporated city or town in which the license is granted, or to the county legislative authority if the license is granted outside the boundaries of incorporated cities or towns.</p>

<p>The agency is empowered to administer a user permit system and issue site use permits for generators, packagers, or brokers to use the commercial low-level radioactive waste disposal facility. The agency may issue a site use permit consistent with the requirements of this chapter and the rules adopted under it and the requirements of the Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management under chapter 70A.380 RCW. The agency may deny an application for a site use permit or modify, suspend, or revoke a site use permit in any case in which it finds that the permit was obtained by fraud or there is or has been a failure, refusal, or inability to comply with the requirements of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter or the requirements of the Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management under chapter 70A.380 RCW. The agency may also deny or suspend a site use permit for failure to comply with RCW 70A.384.110.</p>
</li>

<p>The agency shall collect a fee from the applicants for site use permits that is sufficient to fund the costs to the agency to administer the user permit system. The site use permit fee must be set at a level that is also sufficient to fund state participation in activities related to the Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management under chapter 70A.380 RCW. The site use permit fees must be deposited in the site closure account established in RCW 70A.384.050(2). Appropriations to the department of health or the department of ecology are required to permit expenditures using site use permit fee funds from the site closure account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agency shall collect a surveillance fee as an added charge on each cubic foot of low-level radioactive waste disposed of at the commercial low-level radioactive waste disposal site in this state which shall be set at a level that is sufficient to fund completely the radiation control activities of the agency directly related to the disposal site, including but not limited to the management, licensing, monitoring, and regulation of the site. The fee shall also provide funds to the Washington state patrol for costs incurred from inspection of low-level radioactive waste shipments entering this state. Disbursements for this purpose shall be by authorization of the secretary of the department of health or the secretary's designee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agency shall require that any person who holds or applies for a permit under this chapter indemnify and hold harmless the state from claims, suits, damages, or expenses on account of injuries to or death of persons and property damage, arising or growing out of any operations and activities for which the person holds the permit, and any necessary or incidental operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agency may adopt such rules as are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under this section.</p>
