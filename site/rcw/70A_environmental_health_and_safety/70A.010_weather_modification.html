The balance due shall be paid within three months from the date of the termination of the operation as prescribed in the permit. Failure to pay a permit fee as required shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the license of the delinquent permit holder and grounds for refusal to renew his or her license or to issue any further permits to such person.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that when prolonged lack of precipitation or shortages of water supply in the state cause severe hardships affecting the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the state, a program to increase precipitation is occasionally needed for the generation of hydroelectric power, for domestic purposes, and to alleviate hardships created by the threat of forest fires and shortages of water for agriculture. Cloud seeding has been demonstrated to be such a program of weather modification with increasing scientific certainty.</p>
