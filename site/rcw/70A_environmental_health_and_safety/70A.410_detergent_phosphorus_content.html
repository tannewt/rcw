<p>The legislature hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Phosphorus loading of surface waters can stimulate the growth of weeds and algae, and that such growth can have adverse environmental, health, and aesthetic effects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Household detergents contribute to phosphorus loading, and that a limit on detergents containing phosphorus can significantly reduce the discharge of phosphorus into the state's surface and ground waters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Household detergents containing no or very low phosphorus are readily available and that over thirty percent of the United States population lives in areas with a ban on detergents containing phosphorus;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phosphorus limits on household detergents can significantly reduce treatment costs at those sewage treatment facilities that remove phosphorus from the waste stream; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While significant reductions of phosphorus from laundry detergent have been accomplished, similar progress in reducing phosphorus contributions from dishwashing detergents has not been achieved.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is therefore the intent of the legislature to impose a statewide limit on the phosphorus content of household detergents.</p>
