<p>The legislature finds that leaking underground storage tanks containing petroleum and other regulated substances pose a serious threat to human health and the environment. To address this threat, the legislature intends for the department of ecology to establish an underground storage tank program designed, operated, and enforced in a manner that, at a minimum, meets the requirements for delegation of the federal underground storage tank program of the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. Sec. 6901, et seq.). The legislature intends that statewide requirements for underground storage tanks adopted by the department be consistent with and no less stringent than the requirements in the federal regulations and the underground storage tank compliance act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 15801 et seq., energy policy act of 2005, P.L. 109-58, Title XV, subtitle B).</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that certain areas of the state possess physical characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to threats from leaking underground storage tanks and that in these environmentally sensitive areas, local requirements more stringent than the statewide requirements may apply.</p>

<p>The department must adopt rules establishing requirements for all underground storage tanks that are regulated under the federal act, taking into account the various classes or categories of tanks to be regulated. The rules must be consistent with and no less stringent than the federal regulations and the underground storage tank compliance act of 2005 and consist of requirements for the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>New underground storage tank system design, construction, installation, and notification;</p>

<p>The department must issue a one-time &quot;facility compliance tag&quot; to underground storage tank facilities that have installed the equipment required to meet corrosion protection, spill prevention, overfill prevention, leak detection standards, have demonstrated financial responsibility, and have paid annual tank fees. The facility must continue to maintain compliance with corrosion protection, spill prevention, overfill prevention, and leak detection standards, financial responsibility, and have remitted annual tank fees to display a facility compliance tag. The facility compliance tag must be displayed on or near the fire emergency shutoff device, or in the absence of such a device in close proximity to the fill pipes and clearly identifiable to persons delivering regulated substance to underground storage tanks.</p>
