<p>The director may establish in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, by regulation, standards for the special packaging of any household substance if he or she finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The degree or nature of the hazard to children in the availability of such substance, by reason of its packaging is such that special packaging is required to protect children from serious personal injury or serious illness resulting from handling, using, or ingesting such substance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The special packaging to be required by such standard is technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate for such substance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In establishing a standard under this section, the director shall consider:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The reasonableness of such standard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available scientific, medical, and engineering data concerning special packaging and concerning childhood accidental ingestions, illness, and injury caused by household substances;</p>

<p>Nothing in this chapter authorizes the director to prescribe specific packaging designs, product content, package quantity, or, with the exception of authority granted in RCW 70A.425.110(1)(b), labeling. In the case of a household substance for which special packaging is required pursuant to a regulation under this section, the director may in such regulation prohibit the packaging of such substance in packages which he or she determines are unnecessarily attractive to children.</p>
</li>

<p>The director shall cause the regulations promulgated under this chapter to conform with the requirements or exemptions of the federal hazardous substances act and with the regulations or interpretations promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>

<li>
<p>For the purpose of making any household substance which is subject to a standard established under RCW 70A.425.100 readily available to elderly persons or persons with disabilities unable to use such substance when packaged in compliance with such standard, the manufacturer or packer, as the case may be, may package any household substance, subject to such a standard, in packaging of a single size which does not comply with such standard if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The manufacturer or packer also supplies such substance in packages which comply with such standard; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The packages of such substance which do not meet such standard bear conspicuous labeling stating: &quot;This package for households without young children&quot;; except that the director may by regulation prescribe a substitute statement to the same effect for packaging too small to accommodate such labeling.</p>

<p>In the case of a household substance subject to such a standard which is packaged under subsection (1) of this section in a noncomplying package, if the director determines that such substance is not also being supplied by a manufacturer or packer in popular size packages which comply with such standard, he or she may, after giving the manufacturer or packer an opportunity to comply with the purposes of this chapter, by order require such substance to be packaged by such manufacturer or packer exclusively in special packaging complying with such standard if he or she finds, after opportunity for hearing, that such exclusive use of special packaging is necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.</p>
