The articles of incorporation may limit or permit the preemptive rights of a shareholder to acquire unissued shares of the converted savings bank and may thereafter by amendment limit, deny, or grant to shareholders of any class of stock or of any series of preferred stock the preemptive right to acquire additional shares of the converted savings bank whether then or thereafter authorized. The articles of incorporation may establish or may specify procedures, in accordance with *RCW 30.08.083, for the division of a class of preferred stock into series.

One of the director of financial institutions' certificates of authorization shall be attached to each of the articles of incorporation, and one set of these shall be filed and retained by the director of financial institutions, one set shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state, and one set shall be transmitted to the bank for its files. Upon the receipt from the corporation of the same fees as are required for filing and recording other incorporation certificates or articles the secretary of state shall record the same; whereupon the conversion of the mutual savings bank shall be deemed complete, the requirements of RCW 32.08.010 relating to the incorporation certificate of an unconverted mutual savings bank shall no longer apply, and the signers of the articles of incorporation and their successors shall be a corporation having the powers and being subject to the duties and obligations prescribed by the laws of this state applicable to converted mutual savings banks, and the time of existence of the corporation shall be perpetual, unless terminated pursuant to law.</p>

<p>Every converted savings bank shall be managed by not less than five directors, except that a bank having a capital of fifty thousand dollars or less may have only three directors. Directors shall be elected by the stockholders and hold office for one year and until their successors are elected and have qualified. In the first instance the directors shall be those named in the articles of incorporation and afterwards, those elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held at least once each year on a day to be specified by the converted savings bank's bylaws but not later than May 15th of each year. If for any cause an election is not held at that time, it may be held at an adjourned meeting or at a subsequent meeting called for that purpose in the manner prescribed by the corporation's bylaws. Each director shall be a resident of a state of the United States. The directors shall meet at least nine times each year and whenever required by the director. A majority of the board of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. At all stockholders' meetings, each share shall be entitled to one vote, unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise. Any stockholder may vote in person or by written proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the board of directors consists of nine or more members, in lieu of electing the entire number of directors annually, the converted savings bank's articles of incorporation or bylaws may provide that the directors be divided into either two or three classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, the term of office of directors of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders after their election, that of the second class to expire at the second annual meeting after their election, and that of the third class, if any, to expire at the third annual meeting after their election. At each annual meeting after such classification, the number of directors equal to the number of the class whose term expires at the time of such meeting shall be elected to hold office until the second succeeding annual meeting, if there are two classes, or until the third succeeding annual meeting, if there are three classes. A classification of directors shall not be effective prior to the first annual meeting of shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each director, so far as the duty devolves upon him or her, shall diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the corporation and shall not knowingly violate or willingly permit to be violated any provision of law applicable to the corporation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of the director's predecessor in office.
