</li>
<li>
<p>If the writ is directed to an employer for the purpose of garnishing earnings of a defendant, on the grounds that the defendant:</p>

<p>In an action on the bond under RCW 6.26.020, if it is shown that the garnishment was wrongfully sued out, the defendant may recover the actual damages sustained and reasonable attorney's fees to be fixed by the court.

<li>
<p>When application is made for a prejudgment writ of garnishment, the court shall issue the writ in substantially the form prescribed in RCW 6.27.070 and 6.27.100 directing that the garnishee withhold an amount as prescribed in RCW 6.27.090, but, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the court shall issue the writ only after prior notice to the defendant, given in the manner prescribed in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, with an opportunity for a prior hearing at which the plaintiff shall establish the probable validity of the plaintiff's claim and that there is probable cause to believe that the alleged ground for garnishment exists.</p>

<p>When notice and a hearing are required under this section, notice may be given by a show cause order stating the date, time, and place of the hearing.

<p>NOTICE OF RIGHT TO HEARING</p>
<p>A writ of garnishment has been or will be issued by a Washington court and has been or will be served on the garnishee defendant.

Service of this notice of your rights is required by law.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO A PROMPT HEARING. If notice of a hearing date and time is not served with this notice, you have the right to request the hearing. At the hearing, the plaintiff must give evidence that there is probable cause to believe that the statements in the enclosed affidavit are true and also that the claim stated in the lawsuit is probably valid, or else the garnishment will be released.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>If service of notice on the defendant must be effected by publication, only the following notice need be published under the caption of the case:</li>
</ol>
<p>To, Defendant:</p>

<p>YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ASK FOR A HEARING. At the hearing, the plaintiff must give evidence that there is probable cause to believe that the ground for garnishment alleged in an affidavit filed with the court exists and also that the claim stated in the lawsuit is probably valid, or else the garnishment will be released.</p>
<p>If the defendant is an individual, the following paragraph shall be added to the published notice:</p>
<p>YOU MAY ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE THE GARNISHMENT RELEASED if amounts or property withheld are exempt under federal or state statutes, for example, bank accounts in which benefits such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security, United States pension, Unemployment Compensation, or Veterans' benefits have been deposited or certain personal property described in section 6.15.010 of the Revised Code of Washington.</p>
