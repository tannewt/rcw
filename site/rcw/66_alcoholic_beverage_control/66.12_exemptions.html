<p>The legislature finds that the production of alcohol for use as a fuel or fuel supplement is of great importance to the state. Alcohol, when used as a fuel source, is less polluting to the atmosphere than conventional fuels and its use reduces the state's dependence on limited oil resources. Production of alcohol for use as a fuel provides a new use and market for Washington agricultural products and aids Washington farmers in producing food and fiber for the citizens of the state, nation, and world. Therefore, the legislature declares public policy to be one of encouragement toward the production and use of alcohol as a fuel or fuel supplement.</p>
