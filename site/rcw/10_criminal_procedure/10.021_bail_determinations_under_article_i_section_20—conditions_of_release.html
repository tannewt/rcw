<p>It is the intent of the legislature to enact a law for the purpose of reasonably assuring public safety in bail determination hearings and hearings pursuant to the proposed amendment to Article I, section 20 of the state Constitution set forth in House Joint Resolution No. 4220. Other provisions of law address matters relating to assuring the appearance of the defendant at trial and preventing interference with the administration of justice.</p>

<li>
<p>Under this chapter, &quot;pretrial release program&quot; is any program in superior, district, or municipal court, either run directly by a county or city, or by a private or public entity through contract with a county or city, into whose custody an offender is released prior to trial and which agrees to supervise the offender. As used in this section, &quot;supervision&quot; includes, but is not limited to, work release, day monitoring, electronic monitoring, or participation in a 24/7 sobriety program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pretrial release program may not agree to supervise, or accept into its custody, an offender who is currently awaiting trial for a violent offense or sex offense, as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, who has been convicted of one or more violent offenses or sex offenses in the ten years before the date of the current offense, unless the offender's release before trial was secured with a payment of bail.</p>

<p>The hearing must be held immediately upon the defendant's first appearance before the judicial officer unless the defendant, or the attorney for the government, seeks a continuance. Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of such person may not exceed five days (not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday), and a continuance on motion of the attorney for the government may not exceed three days (not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday). During a continuance, such person must be detained.</p>

<p>At the hearing, such defendant has the right to be represented by counsel, and, if financially unable to obtain representation, to have counsel appointed. The defendant must be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise. The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the hearing. The facts the judicial officer uses to support a finding that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community must be supported by clear and convincing evidence of a propensity for violence that creates a substantial likelihood of danger to the community or any persons.</p>
