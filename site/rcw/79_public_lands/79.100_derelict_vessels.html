<p>The legislature finds that there has been an increase in the number of derelict and abandoned vessels that are either grounded or anchored upon publicly or privately owned submerged lands. These vessels are public nuisances and safety hazards as they often pose hazards to navigation, detract from the aesthetics of Washington's waterways, and threaten the environment with the potential release of hazardous materials. The legislature further finds that the costs associated with the disposal of derelict and abandoned vessels are substantial, and that in many cases there is no way to track down the current vessel owners in order to seek compensation. As a result, the costs associated with the removal of derelict vessels becomes a burden on public entities and the taxpaying public.</p>

<li>
<p>An authorized public entity has the authority, subject to the processes and limitations of this chapter, to store, strip, use, auction, sell, salvage, scrap, or dispose of an abandoned or derelict vessel found on or above aquatic lands within the jurisdiction of the authorized public entity. A vessel disposal must be done in an environmentally sound manner and in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws, including the state solid waste disposal provisions provided for in chapter 70A.205 RCW. Scuttling or sinking of a vessel is only permissible after obtaining the express permission of the owner or owners of the aquatic lands below where the scuttling or sinking would occur, and obtaining all necessary state and federal permits or licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary responsibility to remove a derelict or abandoned vessel belongs to the owner, operator, or lessee of the moorage facility or the aquatic lands where the vessel is located. If the authorized public entity with the primary responsibility is unwilling or unable to exercise the authority granted by this section, it may request the department to assume the authorized public entity's authority for a particular vessel. The department may at its discretion assume the authorized public entity's authority for a particular vessel after being requested to do so. For vessels not at a moorage facility, an authorized public entity with jurisdiction over the aquatic lands where the vessel is located may, at its discretion, request to assume primary responsibility for that particular vessel from the owner of the aquatic lands where the vessel is located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority granted by this chapter is permissive, and no authorized public entity has a duty to exercise the authority. No liability attaches to an authorized public entity that chooses not to exercise this authority. An authorized public entity, in the good faith performance of the actions authorized under this chapter, is not liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in the performance of the actions other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. Any person whose assistance has been requested by an authorized public entity, who has entered into a written agreement pursuant to RCW 79.100.070, and who, in good faith, renders assistance or advice with respect to activities conducted by an authorized public entity pursuant to this chapter, is not liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in the rendering of the assistance or advice, other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.</p>

<p>Prior to exercising the authority granted in RCW 79.100.030, the authorized public entity must first obtain custody of the vessel. To do so, the authorized public entity must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Mail notice of its intent to obtain custody, at least twenty days prior to taking custody, to the last known address of the previous owner to register the vessel in any state or with the federal government and to any lienholders or secured interests on record.

</li>
<li>
<p>Post notice of its intent clearly on the vessel for thirty days and publish its intent at least once, more than ten days but less than twenty days prior to taking custody, in a newspaper of general circulation for the county in which the vessel is located; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post notice of its intent on the department's internet website on a page specifically designated for such notices. If the authorized public entity is not the department, the department must facilitate the internet posting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All notices sent, posted, or published in accordance with this section must, at a minimum, explain the intent of the authorized public entity to take custody of the vessel, the rights of the authorized public entity after taking custody of the vessel as provided in RCW 79.100.030, the procedures the owner must follow in order to avoid custody being taken by the authorized public entity, the procedures the owner must follow in order to reclaim possession after custody is taken by the authorized public entity, and the financial liabilities that the owner may incur as provided for in RCW 79.100.060.</p>

<p>Any authorized public entity may tow, beach, or otherwise take temporary possession of a vessel if the owner of the vessel cannot be located or is unwilling or unable to assume immediate responsibility for the vessel and if the vessel:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Is in immediate danger of sinking, breaking up, or blocking navigational channels; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poses a reasonably imminent threat to human health or safety, including a threat of environmental contamination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before taking temporary possession of the vessel, the authorized public entity must make reasonable attempts to consult with the department or the United States coast guard to ensure that other remedies are not available. The basis for taking temporary possession of the vessel must be set out in writing by the authorized public entity within seven days of taking action and be submitted to the owner, if known, as soon thereafter as is reasonable. If the authorized public entity has not already provided the required notice, immediately after taking possession of the vessel, the authorized public entity must initiate the notice provisions in subsection (1) of this section. The authorized public entity must complete the notice requirements of subsection (1) of this section before using or disposing of the vessel as authorized in RCW 79.100.050.</p>

<li>
<p>An authorized public entity may invite the department of ecology to use the authority granted to it under RCW 90.56.410 prior to, or concurrently with, obtaining custody of a vessel under this section.

<p>After taking custody of a vessel, the authorized public entity may use or dispose of the vessel in any appropriate and environmentally sound manner without further notice to any owners, but must give preference to uses that derive some monetary benefit from the vessel, either in whole or in scrap. If no value can be derived from the vessel, the authorized public entity must give preference to the least costly, environmentally sound, reasonable disposal option. Any disposal operations must be consistent with the state solid waste disposal provisions provided for in chapter 70A.205 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>Costs associated with the removal and disposal of an abandoned or derelict vessel under the authority granted in RCW 53.08.320 also qualify for reimbursement from the derelict vessel removal account.</p>

<p>In each biennium, up to twenty percent of the expenditures from the derelict vessel removal account may be used for administrative expenses of the department of licensing and department of natural resources in implementing this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>Priority for use of this account is for the removal of derelict and abandoned vessels that are in danger of sinking, breaking up, or blocking navigation channels, or that present environmental risks such as leaking fuel or other hazardous substances. The department must develop criteria, in the form of informal guidelines, to prioritize removal projects associated with this chapter, but may not consider whether the applicant is a state or local entity when prioritizing. The guidelines must also include guidance to the authorized public entities as to what removal activities and associated costs are reasonable and eligible for reimbursement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must keep all authorized public entities apprised of the balance of the derelict vessel removal account and the funds available for reimbursement. The guidelines developed by the department must also be made available to the other authorized public entities. This subsection (3) must be satisfied by utilizing the least costly method, including maintaining the information on the department's internet website, or any other cost-effective method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authorized public entity may contribute its ten percent of costs that are not eligible for reimbursement by using in-kind services, including the use of existing staff, equipment, and volunteers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter does not guarantee reimbursement for an authorized public entity. Authorized public entities seeking certainty in reimbursement prior to taking action under this chapter may first notify the department of their proposed action and the estimated total costs. Upon notification by an authorized public entity, the department must make the authorized public entity aware of the status of the fund and the likelihood of reimbursement being available. The department may offer technical assistance and assure reimbursement for up to two years following the removal action if an assurance is appropriate given the balance of the fund and the details of the proposed action.</p>
