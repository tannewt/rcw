<p>The Washington state legislature is purposefully designed to be a part-time legislature to provide people from all areas of life the opportunity to participate. All businesses and industries, in the private and public sector, benefit when the legislature is made up of the broadest possible representation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a significant public policy to encourage citizens to serve in the legislature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other states have enacted legislation addressing the duties and responsibilities of legislators and prospective legislators in relation to their regular employment. It is the intent of chapter 271, Laws of 2022 to address potential uncertainties that can occur between employers and employees who are part-time legislators because of the time requirements of the legislature.</p>
