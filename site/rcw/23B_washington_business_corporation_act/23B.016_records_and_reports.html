<p>If a corporation does not allow a shareholder who complies with RCW 23B.16.020(1) to inspect and copy any records required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the superior court of the county where the corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located may summarily order inspection and copying of the records demanded at the corporation's expense upon application of the shareholder.</p>
