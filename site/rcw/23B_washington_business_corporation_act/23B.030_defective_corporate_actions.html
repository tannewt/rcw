<p>As used in this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Date of the defective corporate action&quot; means the date the defective corporate action was purported to have been taken, or, if the exact date is unknown, the approximate date thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Defective corporate action&quot; means (a) any corporate action purportedly taken that is, and at the time such corporate action was purportedly taken would have been, within the power of the corporation, but is void or voidable due to a failure of authorization, and (b) an overissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Failure of authorization&quot; means the failure to authorize, approve, or otherwise effect a corporate action in compliance with the provisions of this title, the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, a corporate resolution, or any plan or agreement to which the corporation is a party, if and to the extent such failure would render such corporate action void or voidable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Overissue&quot; means the purported issuance of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Shares of a class or series in excess of the number of shares of a class or series the corporation was authorized to issue in accordance with RCW 23B.06.010 at the time of such purported issuance; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shares of any class or series that was not authorized for issuance by the articles of incorporation at the time of such purported issuance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Putative shares&quot; means the shares of any class or series of the corporation (including shares issuable upon exercise of rights, options, warrants, or other securities convertible into shares of the corporation, or interests with respect thereto) that were purportedly created or issued as a result of a defective corporate action, that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>But for any failure of authorization would constitute valid shares; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot be determined by the board of directors to be valid shares.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Valid shares&quot; means the shares of any class or series of the corporation that have been duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with this title, including as a result of ratification or validation in accordance with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Validation effective time,&quot; with respect to any defective corporate action ratified or validated in accordance with this chapter, means the later of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The time at which the ratification of the defective corporate action is approved by shareholders, or if approval of shareholders is not required, the time at which the notice required by RCW 23B.30.050 becomes effective in accordance with RCW 23B.01.410; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time at which any articles of validation filed in accordance with RCW 23B.30.070 become effective.</p>
</li>

<p>A defective corporate action is not void or voidable solely as a result of a failure of authorization if ratified in accordance with RCW 23B.30.030 or validated in accordance with RCW 23B.30.080.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ratification under RCW 23B.30.030 or validation under RCW 23B.30.080 is not the exclusive means of ratifying or validating any defective corporate action, and the absence or failure of ratification or validation in accordance with this chapter does not, of itself, affect the validity or effectiveness of any corporate action properly ratified under common law or otherwise, nor does it create a presumption that any such corporate action is or was a defective corporate action or void or voidable.</p>

<p>The defective corporate action to be ratified and, if the defective corporate action involved the purported issuance of putative shares, the number and class or series of putative shares purportedly issued;</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ratify a defective corporate action under this chapter involving the election of the initial board of directors of the corporation under RCW 23B.02.050(1)(b), a majority of the persons who, at the time of the ratification, are exercising the powers of directors must adopt a resolution stating:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The name of the person or persons who first purportedly approved corporate action as initial directors of the corporation;</p>

<p>That the ratification of the election of that person or those persons as the initial directors of the corporation is approved.</p>

<p>If any provision of this title, the articles of incorporation or bylaws, any corporate resolution, or any plan or agreement to which the corporation is a party at the time the resolution required by subsection (1) of this section is adopted, would have required shareholder approval of the defective corporate action to be ratified, either on the date of the defective corporate action or at the time the resolution required by subsection (1) of this section is adopted, for the ratification of the defective corporate action to be approved:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The board of directors must submit the ratification of the defective corporate action for approval by the shareholders in accordance with RCW 23B.30.040;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the quorum and voting requirements applicable to the approval by shareholders of the ratification of the defective corporate action required by RCW 23B.30.030(3) are the quorum and voting requirements that would be applicable if the defective corporate action was being approved at the time the ratification of the defective corporate action is approved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The approval by shareholders of the ratification of a defective corporate action under this chapter involving the election of directors requires that the votes cast within a voting group favoring such ratification exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing such ratification at a meeting at which a quorum is present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putative shares on the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to vote on any matter submitted to shareholders in accordance with RCW 23B.30.030(3) (and without giving effect to any ratification of a defective corporate action involving the purported issuance of putative shares that would become valid shares as a result of the approval of such matter) are neither entitled to vote nor to be counted for quorum purposes in any vote to approve the ratification of any defective corporate action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the ratification of a defective corporate action involving the purported issuance of putative shares would result in an overissue, in addition to the approval required by RCW 23B.30.030, the board of directors and shareholders must approve an amendment to the articles of incorporation in accordance with chapter 23B.10 RCW to increase the number of shares of a class or series that the corporation is authorized to issue or to create a class or series of shares that the corporation is authorized to issue so there would be no overissue.</p>
