<p>The purposes of this chapter are to permit the state and local governments to conform with registration requirements of federal law which are necessary to exempt interest payments from federal income taxes when the state or local governments issue bonds or incur other obligations and to authorize the establishment and maintenance of differing systems of registering bonds and other obligations as these systems are developed and recognized, which may be instituted, discontinued, and reinstituted from time to time. It is further the purpose of this chapter to grant local governments an alternative flexible authority to structure and sell their bond issues and to include a variety of features on their bonds.</p>
<p>This act shall be liberally construed to effect its purposes.</p>

<p>The state and local governments are authorized to establish a system of registering the ownership of their bonds or other obligations as to principal and interest, or principal only. Registration may include, without limitation: (a) A book entry system of recording the ownership of a bond or other obligation whether or not a physical instrument is issued; or (b) recording the ownership of a bond or other obligation together with the requirement that the transfer of ownership may only be effected by the surrender of the old bond or other obligation and either the reissuance of the old bond or other obligation or the issuance of a new bond or other obligation to the new owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system of registration shall define the method or methods by which transfer of the registered bonds or other obligations shall be effective, and by which payment of principal and any interest shall be made. The system of registration may permit the issuance of bonds or other obligations in any denomination to represent several registered bonds or other obligations of smaller denominations. The system of registration may also provide for any writing relating to a bond or other obligation that is not issued as a physical instrument, for identifying numbers or other designations, for a sufficient supply of certificates for subsequent transfers, for record and payment dates, for varying denominations, for communications to the owners of bonds or other obligations, for accounting, canceled certificate destruction, registration and release of securing interests, and for such other incidental matters pertaining to the registration of bonds or other obligations as the issuer may deem to be necessary or appropriate.</p>

<p>General obligation bonds constitute an indebtedness of the local government issuing the bonds that are subject to the indebtedness limitations provided in Article VIII, section 6 of the state Constitution and are payable from tax revenues of the local government and such other money lawfully available and pledged or provided by the governing body of the local government for that purpose. Such governing body may pledge the full faith, credit and resources of the local government for the payment of general obligation bonds. The payment of such bonds shall be enforceable in mandamus against the local government and its officials.

<p>Any local government authorized to issue revenue bonds may issue revenue bonds under this section and RCW 39.46.160. If a local government chooses to issue revenue bonds under this section and RCW 39.46.160, the issue shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions of these sections. The authority to issue revenue bonds under this section and RCW 39.46.160 is supplementary and in addition to any authority otherwise existing. The maximum term of any revenue bonds shall be forty years unless another statute authorizing the local government to issue revenue bonds provides for a different maximum term, in which event the local government may issue revenue bonds only with terms not in excess of such different maximum term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governing body of a local government issuing revenue bonds shall create a special fund or funds, or use an existing special fund or funds, exclusively from which, along with reserve funds which may be created by the governing body, the principal and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable. These reserve funds include those authorized to be created by RCW 39.46.160.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Subject to the limitations contained in this section, the governing body of a local government may provide such covenants as it may deem necessary to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on revenue bonds, and premium on revenue bonds, if any. Such covenants may include, but are not limited to, depositing certain revenues into a special fund or funds as provided in subsection (3) of this section; establishing, maintaining, and collecting fees, rates, charges, tariffs, or rentals, on facilities and services, the income of which is pledged for the payment of such bonds; operating, maintaining, managing, accounting, and auditing the local government; appointing trustees, depositaries, and paying agents; and any and all matters of like or different character, which affect the security or protection of the revenue bonds.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The governing body may obligate the local government to set aside and pay into a special fund or funds created under subsection (2) of this section a proportion or a fixed amount of the revenues from the following: (a) The public improvements, projects, or facilities that are financed by the revenue bonds; or (b) the public utility or system, or an addition or extension to the public utility or system, where the improvements, projects, or facilities financed by the revenue bonds are a portion of the public utility or system; or (c) all the revenues of the local government; or (d) any other money legally available for such purposes. As used in this subsection, the term &quot;revenues&quot; includes the operating revenues of a local government that result from fees, rates, charges, tariffs, or rentals imposed upon the use or availability or benefit from projects, facilities, or utilities owned or operated by the local government and from related services provided by the local government and other revenues legally available to be pledged to secure the revenue bonds.</li>
</ol>
<p>The proportion or fixed amount of revenue so obligated shall be a lien and charge against these revenues, subject only to maintenance and operating expenses. The governing body shall have due regard for the cost of maintenance and operation of the public utility, system, improvement, project, facility, addition, or extension that generates revenues obligated to be placed into the special fund or funds from which the revenue bonds are payable, and shall not set aside into the special fund or funds a greater amount or proportion of the revenues that in its judgment will be available over and above such cost of maintenance and operation and the proportion or fixed amount, if any, of the revenue so previously pledged. Other revenues, including tax revenues, lawfully available for maintenance or operation of revenue generating facilities may be used for maintenance and operation purposes even though the facilities are acquired, constructed, expanded, replaced, or repaired with moneys arising from the sale of revenue bonds. However, the use of these other revenues for maintenance and operation purposes shall not be deemed to directly or indirectly guarantee the revenue bonds or create a general obligation. The obligation to maintain and impose fees, rates, charges, tariffs, or rentals at levels sufficient to finance maintenance and operations shall remain if the other revenues available for such purposes diminish or cease.</p>
<p>The governing body may also provide that revenue bonds payable out of the same source or sources of revenue may later be issued on a parity with any revenue bonds being issued and sold.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>A revenue bond issued by a local government shall not constitute an obligation of the state, either general or special, nor a general obligation of the local government issuing the bond, but is a special obligation of the local government issuing the bond, and the interest and principal on the bond shall only be payable from the special fund or funds established pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the revenues lawfully pledged to the special fund or funds, and any lawfully created reserve funds. The owner of a revenue bond shall not have any claim for the payment thereof against the local government arising from the revenue bond except for payment from the special fund or funds, the revenues lawfully pledged to the special fund or funds, and any lawfully created reserve funds. The owner of a revenue bond issued by a local government shall not have any claim against the state arising from the revenue bond.
