<p>It is declared to be the public policy of the state of Washington to promote and facilitate the orderly development and economic stability of its urban areas. The provision of adequate government services and the creation of employment opportunities for the citizens within urban areas depends upon the economic growth and the strength of their tax base. The construction of necessary public improvements in accordance with local community planning will encourage investment in job-producing private development and will expand the public tax base.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to allocate a portion of regular property taxes for limited periods of time to assist in the financing of public improvements which are needed to encourage private development of urban areas; to prevent or arrest the decay of urban areas due to the inability of existing financing methods to provide needed public improvements; to encourage local taxing districts to cooperate in the allocation of future tax revenues arising in urban areas in order to facilitate the long-term growth of their common tax base; and to encourage private investment within urban areas.</p>
