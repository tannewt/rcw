<p>The term &quot;employment&quot; includes service performed in the employ of an Indian tribe, as defined in section 3306(u) of the federal unemployment tax act, provided such service is excluded from &quot;employment&quot; as defined in the federal unemployment tax act solely by reason of section 3306(c)(7), the federal unemployment tax act, and is not otherwise excluded from &quot;employment&quot; under this title. For purposes of this section, the exclusions from employment in RCW 50.44.040, except *RCW 50.44.040(12) addressing nongovernmental preschools, are applicable to services performed in the employ of an Indian tribe.</p>
