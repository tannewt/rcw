<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature declares that an individual with capacity has the ability to control decisions relating to his or her own behavioral health care. The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Some behavioral health disorders cause individuals to fluctuate between capacity and incapacity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During periods when an individual's capacity is unclear, the individual may be unable to access needed treatment because the individual may be unable to give informed consent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early treatment may prevent an individual from becoming so ill that involuntary treatment is necessary; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals with behavioral health disorders need some method of expressing their instructions and preferences for treatment and providing advance consent to or refusal of treatment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that a mental health advance directive can be an essential tool for an individual to express his or her choices at a time when the effects of a behavioral health disorder have not deprived him or her of the power to express his or her instructions or preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A mental health advance directive must provide the individual with a full range of choices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals with behavioral health disorders have varying perspectives on whether they want to be able to revoke a directive during periods of incapacity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a mental health advance directive to be an effective tool, individuals must be able to choose how they want their directives treated during periods of incapacity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must be clear standards so that treatment providers can readily discern an individual's treatment choices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Consequently, the legislature affirms that, pursuant to other provisions of law, a validly executed mental health advance directive is to be respected by agents, guardians, and other surrogate decision makers, health care providers, professional persons, and health care facilities.</p>

<p>A principal with capacity may, by written statement by the principal or at the principal's direction in the principal's presence, revoke a directive in whole or in part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incapacitated principal may revoke a directive only if he or she elected at the time of executing the directive to be able to revoke when incapacitated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The revocation need not follow any specific form so long as it is written and the intent of the principal can be discerned. In the case of a directive that is stored in the health care declarations registry created by RCW 70.122.130, the revocation may be by an online method established by the department of health. Failure to use the online method of revocation for a directive that is stored in the registry does not invalidate a revocation that is made by another method described under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The principal shall provide a copy of his or her written statement of revocation to his or her agent, if any, and to each health care provider, professional person, or health care facility that received a copy of the directive from the principal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The written statement of revocation is effective:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>As to a health care provider, professional person, or health care facility, upon receipt. The professional person, health care provider, or health care facility, or persons acting under their direction shall make the statement of revocation part of the principal's medical record; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As to the principal's agent, upon receipt. The principal's agent shall notify the principal's health care provider, professional person, or health care facility of the revocation and provide them with a copy of the written statement of revocation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A directive also may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Be revoked, in whole or in part, expressly or to the extent of any inconsistency, by a subsequent directive; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be superseded or revoked by a court order, including any order entered in a criminal matter. A directive may be superseded by a court order regardless of whether the order contains an explicit reference to the directive. To the extent a directive is not in conflict with a court order, the directive remains effective, subject to the provisions of RCW 71.32.150. A directive shall not be interpreted in a manner that interferes with: (i) Incarceration or detention by the department of corrections, in a city or county jail, or by the department of social and health services; or (ii) treatment of a principal who is subject to involuntary treatment pursuant to chapter 10.77, 71.05, 71.09, or 71.34 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A directive that would have otherwise expired but is effective because the principal is incapacitated remains effective until the principal is no longer incapacitated unless the principal has elected to be able to revoke while incapacitated and has revoked the directive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a principal with capacity consents to treatment that differs from, or refuses treatment consented to in, the provisions of his or her directive, the consent or refusal constitutes a waiver of that provision and does not constitute a revocation of the provision or directive unless the principal also revokes the directive or provision.</p>
