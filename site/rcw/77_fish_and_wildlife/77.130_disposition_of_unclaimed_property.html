<li>
<p>Retain the property for the use of the department subject to giving notice in the manner prescribed in RCW 63.35.030 and the right of the owner, or the owner's legal representative, to reclaim the property within one year after receipt of notice, without compensation for ordinary wear and tear if, in the opinion of the director, the property consists of firearms or other items specifically usable in law enforcement work. At the end of each calendar year during which there has been such a retention, the department shall provide the office of financial management and retain for public inspection a list of such retained items and an estimation of each item's replacement value;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The item has been unclaimed by any person after notice procedures have been met, as prescribed in this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director has determined that the item is illegal to possess or sell or unsafe and unable to be made safe for use by any member of the general public;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the item is not unsafe or illegal to possess or sell, such item, after satisfying the notice requirements as prescribed in this section may be offered by the director to bona fide dealers, in trade for law enforcement equipment, which equipment must be treated as retained property for the purpose of annual listing requirements of subsection (2) of this section; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of one year, any unclaimed firearm must be disposed of pursuant to RCW 9.41.098(2). Any other item that is not unsafe or illegal to possess or sell, but has been, or may be used, in the judgment of the director, in a manner that is illegal, may be destroyed.</p>
