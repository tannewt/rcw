<p>&quot;Goods&quot; means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8) and things in action. &quot;Goods&quot; also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from realty (RCW 62A.2-107).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are &quot;future&quot; goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.</p>

<p>There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods.</p>

<li>
<p>An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common.</p>

<p>In this Article unless the context otherwise requires &quot;contract&quot; and &quot;agreement&quot; are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. &quot;Contract for sale&quot; includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A &quot;sale&quot; consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (RCW 62A.2-401). A &quot;present sale&quot; means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are &quot;conforming&quot; or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Termination&quot; occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On &quot;termination&quot; all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Cancellation&quot; occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of &quot;termination&quot; except that the canceling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.</p>

<li>
<p>A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract.

<p>An agreement modifying a contract within this Article needs no consideration to be binding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A party may perform his or her duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his or her original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in RCW 62A.9A-406, unless otherwise agreed, all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him or her by his or her contract, or impair materially his or her chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his or her entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) of this section unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (a) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (b) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary, a prohibition of assignment of &quot;the contract&quot; is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assignment of &quot;the contract&quot; or of &quot;all my rights under the contract&quot; or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him or her to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his or her rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (RCW 62A.2-609).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, an assignment that would be a breach but for the provisions of RCW 62A.9A-406 may create reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the due performance of the assignor (RCW 62A.2-609).</p>

<li>
<p>Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as &quot;warrant&quot; or &quot;guarantee&quot; or that he or she have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.</p>

<p>Failure of the buyer seasonably to furnish an agreed letter of credit is a breach of the contract for sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The delivery to seller of a proper letter of credit suspends the buyer's obligation to pay. If the letter of credit is dishonored, the seller may on seasonable notification to the buyer require payment directly from him or her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed, the term &quot;letter of credit&quot; or &quot;banker's credit&quot; in a contract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute. The term &quot;confirmed credit&quot; means that the credit must also carry the direct obligation of such an agency which does business in the seller's financial market.</p>

<li>
<p>In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lots each lot is the subject of a separate sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Where a bid is made while the hammer is falling in acceptance of a prior bid the auctioneer may in his or her discretion reopen the bidding or declare the goods sold under the bid on which the hammer was falling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve, the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he or she announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his or her bid until the auctioneer's announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder's retraction does not revive any previous bid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the auctioneer knowingly receives a bid on the seller's behalf or the seller makes or procures such a bid, and notice has not been given that liberty for such bidding is reserved, the buyer may at his or her option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of the last good faith bid prior to the completion of the sale. This subsection shall not apply to any bid at a forced sale.</p>

<p>Each provision of this Article with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this Article and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (RCW 62A.2-501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this title. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9A), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his or her performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him or her to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he or she delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a &quot;sale.&quot;</p>

<p>Subject to any security interest in the buyer (RCW 62A.2-711(3)), when the seller has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection a merchant buyer is under a duty after rejection of goods in his or her possession or control to follow any reasonable instructions received from the seller with respect to the goods and in the absence of such instructions to make reasonable efforts to sell them for the seller's account if they are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the buyer sells goods under subsection (1) of this section, he or she is entitled to reimbursement from the seller or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling them, and if the expenses include no selling commission then to such commission as is usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten per cent on the gross proceeds.</p>
