<p>When real property is acquired by purchase or condemnation by the state of Washington, any county or municipal corporation or is placed under a recorded agreement for immediate possession and use or an order of immediate possession and use pursuant to RCW 8.04.090, such property shall continue to be subject to the tax lien for the years prior to the year in which the property is so acquired or placed under such agreement or order, of any tax levied by the state, county, municipal corporation or other tax levying public body, except as is otherwise provided in RCW 84.60.070.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lien for taxes applicable to the real property being acquired or placed under immediate possession and use for the year in which such real property is so acquired or placed under immediate possession and use shall be for only the pro rata portion of taxes allocable to that portion of the year prior to the date of execution of the instrument vesting title, date of recording such agreement of immediate possession and use, date of such order of immediate possession and use, or date of judgment. No taxes levied or tax lien on such property allocable to a period subsequent to the dates identified in this subsection shall be valid and any such taxes levied shall be canceled as provided in RCW 84.48.065. In the event the owner has paid taxes allocable to that portion of the year subsequent to the dates identified in this subsection he or she shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of the amount paid on the property so acquired or placed under a recorded agreement or an order of immediate possession and use. If the dates identified in this subsection precede the completion of the property tax rolls for the current year's collection in the year in which such taxes become payable, no lien for such taxes shall be valid and any such taxes levied but not payable shall be canceled as provided in RCW 84.48.065.</p>

<p>When only part of a parcel of real property is required by a public body either of the parties may require the assessor to segregate the taxes and the assessed valuation as between the portion of property so required and the remainder thereof. If the assessed valuation of the portion of the property not required exceeds the amount of all delinquent taxes and taxes payable on the entire parcel, and if the owner so elects the lien for the taxes owing and payable on all the property shall be set over to the property retained by the owner. All county assessors are hereby authorized and required to segregate taxes as provided above.</p>
