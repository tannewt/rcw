<p>The department of archaeology and historic preservation may grant, by nontransferable certificate, the authority to maintain and protect an abandoned cemetery upon application made by a state or local governmental organization, such as a city or county, or by a preservation organization that has been incorporated for the purpose of restoring, maintaining, and protecting an abandoned cemetery. Such authority is limited to the care, maintenance, restoration, protection, and historical preservation of the abandoned cemetery, and does not include authority to make burials. In order to activate a historical cemetery for burials, an applicant must apply for a certificate of authority to operate a cemetery from the funeral and cemetery board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those organizations that are granted authority to maintain and protect an abandoned cemetery are entitled to hold and possess burial records, maps, and other historical documents as may exist. Organizations that are granted authority to maintain and protect an abandoned cemetery are not liable to those claiming burial rights, ancestral ownership, or to any other person or organization alleging to have control by any form of conveyance not previously recorded at the county auditor's office within the county in which the abandoned cemetery exists. Such organizations are not liable for any reasonable alterations made during restoration work on memorials, roadways, walkways, features, plantings, or any other detail of the abandoned cemetery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the maintenance and preservation corporation be dissolved, the department of archaeology and historic preservation shall revoke the certificate of authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintenance and preservation corporations that are granted authority to maintain and protect an abandoned cemetery may establish care funds.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the department of archaeology and historic preservation may, in its sole discretion, authorize any Washington nonprofit corporation that is not expressly incorporated for the purpose of restoring, maintaining, and protecting an abandoned cemetery, to restore, maintain, and protect one or more abandoned cemeteries. The authorization may include the right of access to any burial records, maps, and other historical documents, but may not include the right to be the permanent custodian of original records, maps, or documents. This authorization must be granted by a nontransferable certificate of authority. Any nonprofit corporation authorized and acting under this subsection is immune from liability to the same extent as if it were a preservation organization holding a certificate of authority under subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of archaeology and historic preservation must establish standards and guidelines for granting certificates of authority under subsections (1) and (2) of this section to assure that any restoration, maintenance, and protection activities authorized under this subsection are conducted and supervised in an appropriate manner.</p>

<p>The coroner must make a determination whether the skeletal human remains are forensic or nonforensic within five business days of receiving notification of a finding of such remains provided that there is sufficient evidence to make such a determination within that time period. The coroner will retain jurisdiction over forensic remains.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Upon determination that the remains are nonforensic, the coroner must notify the department of archaeology and historic preservation within two business days.

A determination that remains are nonforensic does not create a presumption of removal or nonremoval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving notice from a coroner of a finding of nonforensic skeletal human remains, the department must notify the appropriate local cemeteries, and all affected Indian tribes via certified mail to the head of the appropriate tribal government, and contact the appropriate tribal cultural resources staff within two business days of the finding. The determination of what are appropriate local cemeteries to be notified is at the discretion of the department. A notification to tribes of a finding of such nonforensic skeletal human remains does not create a presumption that the remains are Indian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state physical anthropologist must make an initial determination of whether nonforensic skeletal human remains are Indian or non-Indian to the extent possible based on the remains within two business days of notification of a finding of such nonforensic remains. If the remains are determined to be Indian, the department must notify all affected Indian tribes via certified mail to the head of the appropriate tribal government within two business days and contact the appropriate tribal cultural resources staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The affected tribes have five business days to respond via telephone or writing to the department as to their interest in the remains.</p>

<li>
<p>Other tribes with historical and cultural affiliation in the jurisdiction where the remains were found.</p>
