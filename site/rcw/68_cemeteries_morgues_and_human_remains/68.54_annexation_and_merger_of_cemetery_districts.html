<p>Any territory contiguous to a cemetery district and not within the boundaries of a city or town other than as set forth in RCW 68.52.210 or other cemetery district may be annexed to such cemetery district by petition of ten percent of the registered voters residing within the territory proposed to be annexed who voted in the last general municipal election. Such petition shall be filed with the cemetery commissioners of the cemetery district and if the cemetery commissioners shall concur in the petition they shall then file such petition with the county auditor who shall within thirty days from the date of filing such petition examine the signatures thereof and certify to the sufficiency or insufficiency thereof. After the county auditor shall have certified to the sufficiency of the petition, the proceedings thereafter by the county legislative authority, and the rights and powers and duties of the county legislative authority, petitioners and objectors and the election and canvass thereof shall be the same as in the original proceedings to form a cemetery district: PROVIDED, That the county legislative authority shall have authority and it shall be its duty to determine on an equitable basis, the amount of obligation which the territory to be annexed to the district shall assume, if any, to place the taxpayers of the existing district on a fair and equitable relationship with the taxpayers of the territory to be annexed by reason of the benefits of coming into a going district previously supported by the taxpayers of the existing district, and such obligation may be paid to the district in yearly installments to be fixed by the county legislative authority if within the limits as outlined in RCW 68.52.310 and included in the annual tax levies against the property in such annexed territory until fully paid. The amount of the obligation and the plan of payment thereof filed by the county legislative authority shall be set out in general terms in the notice of election for annexation: PROVIDED, That the special election shall be held only within the boundaries of the territory proposed to be annexed to the cemetery district. Upon the entry of the order of the county legislative authority incorporating such contiguous territory within such existing cemetery district, the territory shall become subject to the indebtedness, bonded or otherwise, of the existing district in like manner as the territory of the district. Should such petition be signed by sixty percent of the registered voters residing within the territory proposed to be annexed, and should the cemetery commissioners concur therein, an election in such territory and a hearing on such petition shall be dispensed with and the county legislative authority shall enter its order incorporating such territory within the existing cemetery district.</p>

Such books and records shall be prima facie evidence of truth of the certificate. No signatures may be withdrawn from the petition after the filing.</p>

<li>
<p>If a territory has qualified voters residing within it, then the territory may not be withdrawn from the cemetery district unless a special election is held and a majority of votes cast by qualified voters residing within the district approve the withdrawal. Agreement between the district board of commissioners and the county legislative authority on the findings of fact under RCW 57.28.080 does not preclude an election under this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a territory has no qualified voters residing within it, then no special election is required as applied to procedures for withdrawal of territory under this section. However, if withdrawal of such territory is commenced by the district board of commissioners as provided under RCW 57.28.035, then the territory may not be withdrawn from the cemetery district unless written approval is attained from the owners, according to the records of the county auditor or auditors, of not less than sixty percent of the area of land included in the resolution for withdrawal. The written approval must be attained within sixty days from the date of the final hearing of any county legislative authority on the resolution for withdrawal. Agreement between the district board of commissioners and the county legislative authority on the findings of fact under RCW 57.28.080 does not preclude the written approval requirement under this subsection.</p>
