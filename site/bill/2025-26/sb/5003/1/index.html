<li>
<p>The school security and preparedness infrastructure grant program is created in the office of the superintendent of public instruction.

</li>
<li>
<p>Public school districts are eligible to apply for the grants. Eligible projects include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Entrance and door security including panic buttons;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fencing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perimeter security infrastructure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construction or infrastructure projects designed to direct the public entering school grounds through as few entrances as possible, such as through the main entrance of a school administrative office;</p>

<p>No more than three percent of each grant may be expended by the grant recipients for management and administration of the grant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must develop an application process and project evaluation criteria to evaluate applications. Priority for awards must be based on physical security needs and resulting improved safety. No award per school district may exceed $2,000,000 in a biennium.</p>
</li>
<li>
