    e. Repair or upgrades of existing physical security infrastructure;

    f. Infrastructure designed to assist with or expedite law enforcement response to a threat or emergency within the school grounds; and

    g. Planning grants for improved security on campuses.

3. No more than three percent of each grant may be expended by the grant recipients for management and administration of the grant.

4. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must develop an application process and project evaluation criteria to evaluate applications.
