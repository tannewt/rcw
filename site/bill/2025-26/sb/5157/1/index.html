<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, all sales of valuable materials exceeding $25,000 in appraised value must be at public auction or by sealed bid to the highest bidder, provided that on public lands granted to the state for educational purposes sealed bids may be accepted for sales of timber or stone only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A direct sale of valuable materials may be sold to the applicant for cash at full appraised value without notice or advertising. The board must, by resolution, establish the value amount of a direct sale not to exceed $25,000 in appraised sale value, and establish procedures to ensure that competitive market prices and accountability are guaranteed.</p>
