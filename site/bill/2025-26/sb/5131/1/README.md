# SB 5131 - Religious foods/correctional

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5131.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the constitutionally protected rights of incarcerated persons to believe, express, and exercise the religion of their choice. The legislature further recognizes the positive benefit of religious practice in the form of positive behavior in institutions and in the community. The legislature intends to affirm and support religious practices for faith and cultural groups by providing opportunities to celebrate practices and events. The legislature therefore resolves to codify the opportunity for religious diets in state correctional facilities.

## Section 2
1. The department shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate religious diets in state correctional facilities based on the request of the incarcerated individual.

2. Reasonable efforts under this section include but are not limited to coordination and arrangements with a partnering nonprofit organization in the provision and delivery of a religious diet, including special menu items, meal enhancements, and donated foods. The department may establish reasonable deadlines for sponsorship and contribution of special menu items including special menu items, meal enhancements, and donated foods, but no deadline may exceed 30 days in advance of a religious event.

3. Provision of a religious diet must be made at no cost to the incarcerated person.

4. If a therapeutic diet is recommended for the incarcerated individual, the department shall provide a therapeutic diet that also accommodates the religious diet requested by the incarcerated individual.
