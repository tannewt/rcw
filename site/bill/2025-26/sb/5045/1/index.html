<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is in the public interest of the citizens of Washington to encourage the recovery and reuse of materials, such as metals, that replace the output of mining and other extractive industries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without a dedicated battery stewardship program, battery user confusion regarding proper disposal options will continue to persist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring the proper handling, recycling, and end-of-life management of used batteries prevents the release of toxic materials into the environment and removes materials from the waste stream that, if mishandled, may present safety concerns to workers, such as by igniting fires at solid waste handling facilities. For this reason, batteries should not be placed into commingled recycling containers or disposed of via traditional garbage collection containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jurisdictions around the world have successfully implemented battery stewardship laws that have helped address the challenges posed by the end-of-life management of batteries. Because it is difficult for customers to differentiate between types and chemistries of batteries, it is the best practice for battery stewardship programs to collect all battery types and chemistries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larger batteries used in emerging market sectors such as electric vehicles, solar power arrays, and data centers should be managed to ensure environmentally positive outcomes similar to those achieved by a battery stewardship program because of their potential economic value and anticipated profusion as these market sectors mature. Although the management of some larger batteries continues to be studied, the legislature intends to include electric vehicle batteries in the state battery stewardship program while recognizing the unique characteristics of those batteries.</p>
