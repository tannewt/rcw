2. January of each year will be designated as a time for people of this state to commemorate the contributions of Chinese Americans and Americans of Chinese descent to the history and heritage of Washington state and shall be designated as Chinese American/Americans of Chinese descent history month.

## Section 2
1. Public schools are required to designate time for appropriate activities in commemoration of the lives, history, achievements, and contributions of Chinese Americans and Americans of Chinese descent during January, which is designated as Chinese American/Americans of Chinese descent history month under RCW 43.117.130.
