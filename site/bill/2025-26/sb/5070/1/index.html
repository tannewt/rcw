<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the use of credit or debit cards can prevent an employee from receiving the full amount of their earned tips and gratuities. Currently some employers deduct a proportional amount of any fees the employer is assessed on a credit or debit card transaction from an employee's tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that credit or debit card usage in commercial transactions places an undue financial burden on merchants required to collect taxes on behalf of the state of Washington when the merchant must pay fees assessed on the taxed amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to bring greater transparency, clarity, and accountability to certain acts of commerce. Prohibiting all interchange fees on tips and gratuities will ensure employees receive their full earned tips and gratuities. Prohibiting all interchange fees on taxes merchants collect on behalf of the state will reduce the financial burden merchants bear on behalf of the state.</p>
