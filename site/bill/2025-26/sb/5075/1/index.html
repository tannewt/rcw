<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a health plan issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, that provides coverage for maternity services may not impose any cost-sharing requirements for covered prenatal services including, but not limited to, office visits, laboratory services, ultrasounds and other imaging, prenatal screening tests, prescription drugs, and prenatal vitamins, and covered postnatal services including, but not limited to, office visits, lactation specialists, cesarian section follow-up care, laboratory services, ultrasounds and other imaging, counseling and therapy services, and prescription drugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a health plan that provides coverage of prenatal and postnatal care and is offered as a qualifying health plan for a health savings account, the health carrier shall establish the plan's cost sharing for the coverage of the services described in this section at the minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax exempt contributions from their health savings account under internal revenue service laws and regulations.</p>
