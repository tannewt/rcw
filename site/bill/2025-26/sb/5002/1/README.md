# SB 5002 - Concerning federal immigration enforcement.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5002.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the state's policy interest in protecting immigrant communities and cooperating and assisting the federal government in the enforcement of federal immigration laws within this state. The legislature further finds that immigrant communities are often the most victimized by illegal immigration and that criminal organizations involved in illegal immigration disproportionally target immigrant communities with criminal activity and flagrant abuses of human rights. The legislature intends to respect and protect the health, safety, and dignity of all immigrant communities by establishing a statewide policy that encourages a collaborative partnership with United States immigration and customs enforcement to address and prevent criminal illegal immigration activities and the criminal organizations that facilitate illegal immigration and related crimes.
