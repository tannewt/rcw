<ol>
<li>
<p>The Washington state patrol shall establish a firearms background check program to serve as a centralized single point of contact for dealers to conduct background checks for firearms sales or transfers required under chapter 9.41 RCW and the federal Brady handgun violence prevention act (18 U.S.C. Sec. 921 et seq.). The Washington state patrol shall establish an automated firearms background check system to conduct background checks on applicants for the purchase or transfer of a firearm. The system must include the following characteristics:</p>
<ol type="a">

<li>
<p>Provide a dealer with a notification that a firearm purchase or transfer application has been received;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assign a unique identifier to the background check inquiry;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an automated response to the dealer indicating whether the transfer may proceed or is denied, or that the check is indeterminate and will require further investigation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include measures to ensure data integrity and the confidentiality and security of all records and data transmitted and received by the system; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a performance metrics tracking system to evaluate the performance of the background check system.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a request from a dealer for a background check in connection with the sale or transfer of a firearm, the Washington state patrol shall:</p>

<li>
<p>Provide the dealer with a notification that a firearm transfer application has been received;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the dealer without delay that the records indicate the individual is prohibited from possessing a firearm and the transfer is denied or that the individual is approved to complete the transfer.
