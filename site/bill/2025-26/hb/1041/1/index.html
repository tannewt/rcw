<p>The legislature recognizes that Washington has a target of zero injuries and deaths for users of its roadways and transportation system. Replacement tires with increased tread and durability are important options in helping provide increased safety for drivers in rugged, wet, or icy conditions. The federal government is responsible for the motor vehicle standards, including tires. Therefore, state and local governments may not restrict the manufacture, use, or sale of tires that are in compliance with the federal motor vehicle safety standards prescribed pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 30111. The legislature is protecting the freedom of choice for people to purchase and use tires they want that meet federal motor vehicle safety standards.</p>
