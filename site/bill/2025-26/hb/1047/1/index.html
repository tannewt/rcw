<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that some fire districts, especially those in rural counties, bear disproportionate costs due to the expansive geographic area they must serve with a sparsely populated tax base. It is the intent of the legislature to reduce the costs for certain fire districts in rural counties by exempting their purchases of equipment from sales and use taxes.</p>
