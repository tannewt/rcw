[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1196.pdf)

## Section 1
An "infamous crime" is a state crime punishable by death . Neither an adjudication in juvenile court pursuant to chapter 13.40 RCW, nor a conviction for a misdemeanor , gross misdemeanor, or felony that is not punishable by death, is an "infamous crime." This definition applies for purposes of voter qualifications and does not apply when the term "infamous crime" is used in other titles of the Revised Code of Washington, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise.

## Section 2
A person's right to vote is revoked by reason of a criminal conviction only if that person is convicted in a Washington state court of an infamous crime and sentenced to a term of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, as defined in RCW 29A.04.079. Such a person's right to vote is automatically restored in accordance with RCW 29A.08.520.

## Section 3
1. For a person whose right to vote was revoked pursuant to section 2 of this act, the right to vote is automatically restored as long as the person is not serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections.  A person who has been convicted in a Washington state court of an infamous crime and whose right to vote has been automatically restored must reregister to vote prior to voting.

2. At least once a month, the secretary of state shall compare the list of registered voters to a list of persons who are not eligible to vote as provided in section 2 of this act and subsection (1) of this section. If a registered voter is not eligible to vote as provided in this section, the secretary of state or county auditor shall confirm the match through a date of birth comparison and suspend the voter registration from the official state voter registration list. The secretary of state or county auditor shall send to the person at his or her last known voter registration address and at the department of corrections, if the person is serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department, a notice of the proposed cancellation and an explanation of the requirements for restoring the right to vote and reregistering. To the extent possible, the secretary of state shall time the comparison required by this subsection to allow notice and cancellation of voting rights for ineligible voters prior to a primary or general election.

3. For the purposes of this section, a sentence of total confinement does not include confinement imposed as a sanction for a community custody violation under RCW 9.94A.633(1).

## Section 4
For all voter registrations, the registrant shall sign the following oath:

"I declare that the facts on this voter registration form are true. I am a citizen of the United States, I will have lived at this address in Washington for at least thirty days immediately before the next election at which I vote, and I am at least sixteen years old. I am not disqualified from voting due to a court order, and I am not currently serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections for a conviction in a Washington state court of an infamous crime."

## Section 5
1. Registration of a person as a voter is presumptive evidence of his or her right to vote. A challenge to the person's right to vote must be based on personal knowledge of one of the following:

    a. The challenged voter has been convicted of an infamous crime and the person's voting rights have not been restored under RCW 29A.08.520;

    c. The challenged voter resides at a different address than the residential address provided, and is not subject to RCW 29A.04.151 or 29A.08.112, in which case the challenger must either:

        i. Provide the challenged voter's actual residence on the challenge form; or

        ii. Submit evidence that he or she exercised due diligence to verify that the challenged voter does not reside at the address provided. The challenger must, at minimum, provide evidence that the challenger personally:

(B) Searched local telephone directories, including online directories, to determine whether the voter maintains a telephone listing at any address in the county;

(C) Searched county auditor property records to determine whether the challenged voter owns any property in the county;

(D) Searched the statewide voter registration database to determine if the voter is registered at any other address in the state; and

    d. The challenged voter will not be eighteen years of age by the next general election; or

    e. The challenged voter is not a citizen of the United States.

2. A person's right to vote may be challenged by another registered voter or the county prosecuting attorney.

3. The challenger must file a signed affidavit subject to the penalties of perjury swearing that, to his or her personal knowledge and belief, having exercised due diligence to personally verify the evidence presented, the challenged voter either is not qualified to vote or does not reside at the address given on his or her voter registration record based on one of the reasons allowed in subsection (1) of this section. The challenger must provide the factual basis for the challenge, including any information required by subsection (1)(c) of this section, in the signed affidavit. The challenge may not be based on unsupported allegations or allegations by anonymous third parties. All documents pertaining to the challenge are public records.

4. Challenges based on a  conviction for an infamous crime under section 2 of this act and RCW 29A.08.520 must be heard according to RCW 29A.08.520 and rules adopted by the secretary of state.
