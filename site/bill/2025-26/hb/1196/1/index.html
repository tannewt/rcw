<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>An &quot;infamous crime&quot; is a state crime punishable by death . Neither an adjudication in juvenile court pursuant to chapter 13.40 RCW, nor a conviction for a misdemeanor , gross misdemeanor, or felony that is not punishable by death, is an &quot;infamous crime.&quot; This definition applies for purposes of voter qualifications and does not apply when the term &quot;infamous crime&quot; is used in other titles of the Revised Code of Washington, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>A person's right to vote is revoked by reason of a criminal conviction only if that person is convicted in a Washington state court of an infamous crime and sentenced to a term of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections, as defined in RCW 29A.04.079. Such a person's right to vote is automatically restored in accordance with RCW 29A.08.520.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For a person whose right to vote was revoked pursuant to section 2 of this act, the right to vote is automatically restored as long as the person is not serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections.  A person who has been convicted in a Washington state court of an infamous crime and whose right to vote has been automatically restored must reregister to vote prior to voting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least once a month, the secretary of state shall compare the list of registered voters to a list of persons who are not eligible to vote as provided in section 2 of this act and subsection (1) of this section. If a registered voter is not eligible to vote as provided in this section, the secretary of state or county auditor shall confirm the match through a date of birth comparison and suspend the voter registration from the official state voter registration list. The secretary of state or county auditor shall send to the person at his or her last known voter registration address and at the department of corrections, if the person is serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department, a notice of the proposed cancellation and an explanation of the requirements for restoring the right to vote and reregistering. To the extent possible, the secretary of state shall time the comparison required by this subsection to allow notice and cancellation of voting rights for ineligible voters prior to a primary or general election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, a sentence of total confinement does not include confinement imposed as a sanction for a community custody violation under RCW 9.94A.633(1).</p>

I am a citizen of the United States, I will have lived at this address in Washington for at least thirty days immediately before the next election at which I vote, and I am at least sixteen years old. I am not disqualified from voting due to a court order, and I am not currently serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections for a conviction in a Washington state court of an infamous crime.&quot;</p>
