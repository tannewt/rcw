<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that law enforcement best protects the community when evidence-based investigative tools are utilized.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that a large and growing body of scientific evidence has established that rapport-based, noncoercive interview methods are the most effective means for law enforcement to illicit true, accurate, and reliable information from suspects and witnesses during criminal investigations.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that abandoning deceptive tactics in exchange for rapport-based, noncoercive techniques enhances public trust in the police, encourages public cooperation to facilitate investigations, protects the recall and capacity to exercise sound judgement by those being interviewed, preserves the integrity and professionalism of law enforcement officers, and increases public safety.</p>
<p>The legislature therefore intends to develop and implement training on the use of rapport-based, noncoercive interview techniques by law enforcement, and to facilitate the adoption of such techniques by law enforcement in lieu of the use of deception.</p>
