[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1030.pdf)

## Section 1
1. If inspection of the ballot reveals a physically damaged ballot or ballot that may be otherwise unreadable or uncountable by the tabulating system, the county auditor may refer the ballot to the county canvassing board or duplicate the ballot if so authorized by the county canvassing board. The voter's original ballot may not be altered. A ballot may be duplicated only if the intent of the voter's marks on the ballot is clear and the electronic voting equipment might not otherwise properly tally the ballot to reflect the intent of the voter. Ballots must be duplicated by teams of two or more people working together. When duplicating ballots, the county auditor shall take the following steps to create and maintain an audit trail of the action taken:

    a. Each original ballot and duplicate ballot must be assigned the same unique control number, with the number being marked upon the face of each ballot, to ensure that each duplicate ballot may be tied back to the original ballot;

    b. A log must be kept of the ballots duplicated, which must at least include:

        i. The control number of each original ballot and the corresponding duplicate ballot;

        ii. The initials of at least two people who participated in the duplication of each ballot; and

        iii. The total number of ballots duplicated; and

    c. Original and duplicate ballots must be sealed in secure storage at all times, except during duplication, inspection by the canvassing board, tabulation, or to conduct an audit under RCW 29A.60.185.

2. Prior to certification of the election as required by RCW 29A.60.190, the county auditor shall conduct an audit of ballots duplicated under this section. The audit of duplicated ballots must involve a comparison of the duplicated ballot to the original ballot. The county canvassing board must establish procedures for auditing duplicated ballots.

## Section 2
Prior to certification of the election as required by RCW 29A.60.190, the county auditor shall conduct an audit using at minimum one of the following methods:

1. A limited hand-count audit of randomly selected precincts or batches of ballots to confirm the results of the ballot counting equipment consistent with section 3 of this act; or

2. A risk-limiting audit as defined in section 4 of this act.

## Section 3
A limited hand-count of randomly selected precincts or batches of ballots to confirm the accuracy of the ballot counting equipment may be conducted at the discretion of the county auditor. If political party observers are present, they must be permitted to observe the limited hand-count audit.

1. The county canvassing board must adopt procedures for the limited hand-count audit consistent with rules adopted under RCW 29A.04.611, consistent with RCW 29A.64.021 concerning mandatory recounts prior to the processing of ballots.

2. The limited hand-count audit must involve a comparison of a manual count of ballots to the results for the selected precincts or batches recorded by the original ballot counting equipment. The audit must include at least one precinct or two batches per ballot scanner depending on the ballot counting procedures in place in the county. More precincts or batches can be selected at the discretion of the county auditor. The hand-count audit is limited to one office or issue on the ballots in the precincts or batches that are selected for the audit. The selection of the precincts or batches to be audited must be randomly selected according to procedures established by the county canvassing board.

3. The limited hand-count procedures adopted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section must include a process, consistent with rules adopted under RCW 29A.04.611, for expanding the audit to include additional ballots when a random check conducted under this section results in an unresolvable discrepancy. The procedure must specify under what circumstances a discrepancy will lead to an audit of additional ballots and the method to determine how many additional ballots will be selected. The manual tally process must be completed no later than 72 hours after election day.

4. The results of the limited hand-count audit must be reported to the secretary of state within three business days of completion.

## Section 4
1. At the discretion of the county auditor, or secretary of state, audits may be conducted to confirm the outcome of an election employing a defined "risk limit." The risk-limiting audit confirms that the election outcome reported by the ballot counting system is correct to a desired confidence level. The risk limit must be defined in rule by the secretary of state using best available standards and statistical analysis.

2. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section, section 5 of this act, and RCW 29A.04.611 unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Ballot comparison risk-limiting audit" is the comparison of voter markings on randomly selected ballots with the ballot-level cast vote record produced by the ballot counting equipment until the prespecified risk limit is met.

    b. "Ballot polling risk-limiting audit" involves the selection of a random sample of ballots for hand counting for a selected contest. The voter markings on randomly selected ballots are examined and reported until the sample meets the prespecified risk limit.

    c. "Batch comparison risk-limiting audit" involves the selection of a random sample of batches of ballots for hand counting for a selected contest. The voter markings on all ballots in the randomly selected batches are examined and reported until the sample meets the prespecified risk limit.

    d. "Cast vote record" means a physical or electronic record of the choices of an individual voter in a particular primary, general election, or special election. Cast vote records must be treated in the same manner as voted physical ballots and must be securely handled and stored with the same privacy and security as voted physical ballots and are not subject to public disclosure.

    e. "Risk limit" means the largest statistical probability that an incorrect reported tabulation outcome is not detected by a risk-limiting audit.

    f. "Risk-limiting audit" means an audit protocol that uses statistical principles and methods and is intended to limit the risk of certifying an incorrect election outcome.

3. A county conducting a risk-limiting audit must use software or processes approved by the secretary of state and independent of the voting system used by the county.

## Section 5
1. At such time that the ballot counting systems in all counties are capable of conducting a ballot comparison risk-limiting audit, the secretary of state may choose to conduct a ballot comparison risk-limiting audit on an issue or office that files with the secretary of state under RCW 29A.24.070 or chapter 29A.72 RCW.

2. A state risk-limiting audit must be conducted in a manner consistent with rules adopted under RCW 29A.04.611. The secretary of state shall:

    a. Coordinate the reporting and compilation of results from the counties; and

    b. Report the results of the audit.

3. For each county employing a ballot counting system capable of conducting a comparison risk-limiting audit, at the county auditor's discretion, the county auditor may randomly select at least one ballot contest contained within that county to perform a comparison risk-limiting audit. The audit must be conducted in a manner consistent with rules adopted under RCW 29A.04.611.

4. In addition to the randomly selected contest or contests and in coordination with the secretary of state's office, counties may choose to conduct a risk-limiting audit of a shared district if all counties represented by the district agree to participate. The audit must be conducted in a manner consistent with rules adopted under RCW 29A.04.611.

## Section 6
1. At least 28 days prior to any special election, general election, or primary, the county auditor shall request from the chair of the county central committee of each major political party a list of individuals who are willing to serve as observers. The county auditor has discretion to also request observers from any campaign or organization. The county auditor may delete from the lists names of those persons who indicate to the county auditor that they cannot or do not wish to serve as observers, and names of those persons who, in the judgment of the county auditor, lack the ability to properly serve as observers after training has been made available to them by the auditor.

2. The counting center is under the direction of the county auditor and must be open to observation by one representative from each major political party, if representatives have been appointed by the respective major political parties and these representatives are present while the counting center is operating. The proceedings must be open to the public, but no persons except those employed and authorized by the county auditor may touch any ballot or ballot container or operate a vote tallying system.

## Section 7
The secretary of state as chief election officer shall make reasonable rules in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW not inconsistent with the federal and state election laws to effectuate any provision of this title and to facilitate the execution of its provisions in an orderly, timely, and uniform manner relating to any federal, state, county, city, town, and district elections.
