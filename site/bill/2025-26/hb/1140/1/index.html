<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The state Constitution makes clear that it is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex. The legislature finds the state is failing to meet that paramount duty by providing an education system that, as it exists in statute, discriminates based on these protected classes by forcing children into schools based on their zip code. This creates a system where children and their families often have no other choice but a failing local public school. The state does not provide for the education of children outside of the public school system which means the quality of their education is set by what neighborhood they live in. This is a blatant injustice and a profound violation of civil rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also recognizes the power entrusted to parents to do what is best for their children. Parents can choose to place their student in a common school, charter public school, private school, micro school, or provide home-based instruction. However, not all parents have access to every option. Public charter schools are limited in number and space, while private school options require an extra financial investment from families. Home school requires both, extra financial and time investments, from parents. The legislature knows that wealthy families can pay to send their students to a private school but the families for many kids in rural and poor communities often do not have this ability. The legislature intends to allow all students regardless of protected or socioeconomic status to have the same opportunity to succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the legislature has spent years increasing funding to the public school system, the legislature acknowledges many students have been left behind. National test scores for Washington students have been falling over the last decade and, after extensive school closures, state test scores are down to the lowest levels since administration of the smarter balanced assessment began. For the 2023-24 school year, over 60 percent of Washington's students did not meet grade level standards in math and half did not meet grade level standards in English. School closures also disproportionately impacted students with the most need, specifically those from underrepresented communities. Students with disabilities who were eligible for special education services were delayed in getting their needed supports for too long. It is clear Washington state's public school system is failing families by not preparing students for their future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Academic outcomes are not the only reason public schools in Washington are failing students and families. Our schools are unsafe, and it is unacceptable. With a shift in focus toward divisive instruction, rising childhood mental and behavioral health problems, ineffective discipline policies, rampant bullying, drug abuse, and troubling allegations of sexual misconduct, parents, teachers, and communities are abandoning the system. Recent data paints a disturbing picture: 18 percent of students statewide report feeling unsafe at school, and a staggering 70 percent of teachers feel afraid to go to work. Even more alarming, 79 percent of teachers have been subjected to physical violence, and 67 percent say that violence has driven them to consider leaving the profession. Yet, school districts and the state continue failing to fix these issues, allowing this crisis to fester. Since the 2018-19 school year, there has been a 10 percent increase in private school students and an over 32 percent increase in students receiving home-based instruction. This means less funding for public schools. Pair that with communities failing to pass levies and bonds and you have an even tougher financial dilemma for public schools. If Washington is serious about fixing its schools, we must allow funding to follow students, shattering the public school monopoly and forcing the system to address its deep-rooted problems. By introducing more educational competition, the legislature has the opportunity to rebuild trust, confront these urgent challenges, and provide every child with a safe and world-class education, worthwhile of the investment from Washington taxpayers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature understands many interests served by the current system of public education in our state will oppose families having the freedom to find an adequate education for their children. Longstanding jurisprudence has said that education is a foundational purpose of government, therefore education savings accounts are in no way a gift of public funds. It is in the best interest of Washington state to educate its citizenry and empower parents to do what is best for their child, regardless of their zip code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also acknowledges that some will object to some of the choices families may make. Namely that some families will choose for a myriad of reasons to send their student to a religious private school. However, the United States supreme court has made it clear through two recent cases, Carson v. Makin and Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, that if the government creates a program, it cannot then discriminate against religious institutions' participation. This is not a new concept for Washington state. This state has a history of providing education funding support in private religious institutions, specifically for postsecondary education programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature anticipates that some advocates for public schools and public school teachers will argue this scholarship will defund or damage public schools. However, in no state where education savings accounts have been implemented has this been the case. To the contrary, research shows that test results and outcomes for students in public schools have universally improved in states that have implemented education savings accounts. The competition introduced into these state systems have actually alleviated the harms that a public school monopoly creates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the increased funding and current leadership of the public school system has not led to any positive measurable outcomes for students. The current approach of increasing funding to teachers and administration in hopes of it trickling down to better educational outcomes for students has failed. It is time to empower parents to do what is best for their children by joining the majority of states in expanding school choice. Measures like this enjoy overwhelming, bipartisan support wherever they are implemented. Washington now has the opportunity to not just follow suit, but to take the lead in improving their model of success. This is the civil rights issue of our time, and it is time for Washington to follow the majority of other states in confronting it head on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to allow the money invested in students to follow the student by establishing the empowerED scholarship program. The program would fund education savings accounts for students with priority given to those students who are being failed by the current model, specifically students eligible for special education services, low-income students, and students in failing schools. Parents who apply for the scholarship on behalf of their students are legally required to only use the funds for education-related expenses. The legislature intends to make the funds accessible with the use of a debit card managed by the state with oversight capability so that the system can be audited. The accounts will be funded on a progressive scale, with the lowest income students, qualifying for a greater award. Students eligible for special education services will qualify for additional support. The fund will receive revenue from the legislature, as well as a B&amp;O tax credit, so businesses can provide direct support to students. This measure will empower parents to do what is best for their student regardless of income level or zip code, while also meeting the state's moral and constitutional obligation to put all students first, not just the wealthy ones.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The requirements of this section, and the development protocols described in RCW 74.13.560 for making best interest determinations for students who are the subject of a dependency proceeding pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW, may also be applied to students who are the subject of a federally recognized tribal court shelter care or dependency order that is the equivalent of a shelter care or dependency order issued pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW, and students who are eligible for benefits under the federal foster care system as defined in RCW 28B.117.020.</p>

<p>Best interest determinations should be made as quickly as possible in order to prevent educational discontinuity for the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making best interest determinations, every effort should be made to gather meaningful input from relevant and appropriate persons on their perspectives regarding which school the student should attend while the subject of a dependency proceeding, consistent with the student's case plan. Relevant and appropriate persons include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Representatives of the department of children, youth, and families for students who are the subject of a dependency proceeding pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW, or representatives of other applicable child welfare agencies;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Biological parents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster parents;</p>
</li>

<p>Depending on the student's age, the student.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In accordance with RCW 74.13.550, whenever practical and in their best interest, students who are the subject of a dependency proceeding must remain enrolled in their school of origin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student-centered factors must be used to determine what is in a student's best interest. In order to make a well-informed best interest determination, a variety of student-centered factors should be considered, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>How long is the student's current care placement expected to last?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the student's permanency plan and how does it relate to school stability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many schools has the student attended in the current year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many schools has the student attended over the past few years?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering the impacts of past transfers, how may transferring to a new school impact the student academically, emotionally, physically, and socially?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the immediate and long-term educational plans of, and for, the student?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How strong is the student academically?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the student has special needs, what impact will transferring to a new school have on the student's progress and services?</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>To what extent are the programs and activities at the potential new school comparable to, or more appropriate than, those at the school of origin?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does one school have programs and activities that address the unique needs or interests of the student that the other school does not have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which school does the student prefer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How deep are the student's ties to the student's school of origin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would the timing of the school transfer coincide with a logical juncture, such as after testing, after an event that is significant to the student, or at the end of the school year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would changing schools affect the student's ability to earn full academic credit, participate in sports or other extracurricular activities, proceed to the next grade, or graduate on time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would the commute to the school under consideration impact the student, in terms of distance, mode of transportation, and travel time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How anxious is the student about having been removed from the home or about any upcoming moves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What school does the student's sibling attend?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there safety issues to consider?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would the availability of the empowerED scholarship program established in section 4 of this act make private school or another alternative to traditional public school the best option for the student?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student must remain in the student's school of origin while a best interest determination is made and while disputes are resolved in order to minimize disruption and reduce the number of school transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts are encouraged to use any:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Best interest determination guide developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction during the discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping the student in the school of origin or transferring the student to a new school; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dispute resolution process developed by the office of the superintendent of public instruction when there is a disagreement about school placement, a best interest determination, or a dispute between agencies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The special education services of a student must not be interrupted by a transfer to a new school.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the student's care placement changes to an area served by another school district, and it is determined to be in the best interest of the student to remain in the school of origin, the school district of origin and the school district in which the student is living shall agree upon a method to apportion the responsibility and costs for providing the student with transportation to and from the school of origin. If the school districts are unable to agree upon an apportionment method, the responsibility and costs for transportation shall be shared equally between the districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In accordance with this subsection, the department of children, youth, and families will reimburse school districts for half of all excess transportation costs for students under the placement and care authority of the department of children, youth, and families.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;students who are the subject of a dependency proceeding&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 28A.150.510, and &quot;school of origin&quot; means the school in which a child is enrolled at the time of placement in foster care. If a child's foster care placement changes, the school of origin must be considered the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of the placement change.</p>
