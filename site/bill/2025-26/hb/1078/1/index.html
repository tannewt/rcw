Waiting periods for accidents are prohibited. Waiting periods may not be applied to renewals of existing coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pet insurer utilizing a waiting period permitted in (a) of this subsection shall include a provision in its policy that allows the waiting periods to be waived upon completion of a medical examination.

<p>A pet insurer may not require a veterinary examination of the covered pet for the insured to have their policy renewed.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An insured's eligibility to purchase a pet insurance policy must not be based on participation, or lack of participation, in a separate wellness program.</p>
</li>

<ol type="a">

<p>constitute a preexisting condition as defined in RCW 48.205.020.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>If an insurer ceases writing pet insurance through one affiliated company and moves that business to another affiliated company, current policyholders must receive an offer of insurance from the replacement affiliated company, and the replacement affiliated company may not do any of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Impose a waiting period on the new policy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require a veterinary examination of the covered pet in order to issue or subsequently renew the policy; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancel, refuse to issue, or refuse to renew the new pet insurance policy for any reason in subsection (6) of this section.</p>
