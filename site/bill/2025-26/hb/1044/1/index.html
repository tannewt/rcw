<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the legislature and the state rely on county assessors to timely and accurately value taxable property and rely upon county treasurers to collect and distribute property tax revenues. Both offices have a role in the administration of property transactions. Therefore, the legislature intends to create administrative assistance funds for county assessors and treasurers and to increase REET fees from $5.00 to $20.00 per transaction.</p>
