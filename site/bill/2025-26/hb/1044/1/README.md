# HB 1044 - County REET admin. fees

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1044.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the legislature and the state rely on county assessors to timely and accurately value taxable property and rely upon county treasurers to collect and distribute property tax revenues. Both offices have a role in the administration of property transactions. Therefore, the legislature intends to create administrative assistance funds for county assessors and treasurers and to increase REET fees from $5.00 to $20.00 per transaction.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. For taxes collected by the county under this chapter, the county treasurer shall collect a five dollar fee on all transactions required by this chapter where the transaction does not require the payment of tax.

The county treasurer shall place one and three-tenths percent of the taxes collected by the county under this chapter and the treasurer's fee in the county current expense fund to defray costs of collection.

        ii. "Month's transmittal" means all proceeds deposited by the county through the close of business of the day that is two working days before the last working day of the month.
