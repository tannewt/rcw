<li>
<p>Neither parent's child support obligation owed for all his or her biological or legal children may exceed 45 percent of net income except for good cause shown.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each child is entitled to a pro rata share of the income available for support, but the court only applies the pro rata share to the children in the case before the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before determining whether to apply the 45 percent limitation, the court must consider whether it would be unjust to apply the limitation after considering the best interests of the child and the circumstances of each parent. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, leaving insufficient funds in the custodial parent's household to meet the basic needs of the child, comparative hardship to the affected households, assets or liabilities, and any involuntary limits on either parent's earning capacity including incarceration, disabilities, or incapacity.</p>
</li>

<p>(a) When a parent's monthly net income is below 180 percent of the federal poverty guideline for a one-person family, a support order of not less than $50 per child per month shall be entered unless the obligor parent establishes that it would be unjust to do so in that particular case. The decision whether there is a sufficient basis to deviate below the presumptive minimum payment must take into consideration the best interests of the child and the circumstances of each parent. Such circumstances can include leaving insufficient funds in the custodial parent's household to meet the basic needs of the child, comparative hardship to the affected households, assets or liabilities, and earning capacity.</p>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>
<p>The basic support obligation of the parent making the transfer payment, excluding health care, day care, and special child-rearing expenses, shall not reduce his or her net income below the self-support reserve of 180 percent of the federal poverty level for a one-person family, except for the presumptive minimum payment of $50 per child per month or when it would be unjust to apply the self-support reserve limitation after considering the best interests of the child and the circumstances of each parent. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, leaving insufficient funds in the custodial parent's household to meet the basic needs of the child, comparative hardship to the affected households, assets or liabilities, and earning capacity. This section shall not be construed to require monthly substantiation of income.</p>

<p>The court shall impute income to a parent when the parent is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed. The court shall determine whether the parent is voluntarily underemployed or voluntarily unemployed based upon that parent's assets, residence, employment and earnings history, job skills, educational attainment, literacy, health, age, criminal record, dependency court obligations, and other employment barriers, record of seeking work, the local job market, the availability of employers willing to hire the parent, the prevailing earnings level in the local community, or any other relevant factors. A court shall not impute income to a parent who is gainfully employed on a full-time basis, unless the court finds that the parent is voluntarily underemployed and finds that the parent is purposely underemployed to reduce the parent's child support obligation. Income shall not be imputed for an unemployable parent. Income shall not be imputed to a parent to the extent the parent is unemployed or significantly underemployed due to the parent's efforts to comply with court-ordered reunification efforts under chapter 13.34 RCW or under a voluntary placement agreement with an agency supervising the child.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, in the absence of records of a parent's actual earnings, the court shall impute a parent's income in the following order of priority:</p>

<p>Full-time earnings at the current rate of pay;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-time earnings at the historical rate of pay based on reliable information, such as employment security department data;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-time earnings at a past rate of pay where information is incomplete or sporadic;</p>
</li>

<p>Earnings of 32 hours per week at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where the parent resides if the parent is on or recently coming off temporary assistance for needy families or recently coming off aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefits, pregnant women assistance benefits, essential needs and housing support, supplemental security income, or disability, has recently been released from incarceration, or is a recent high school graduate. Imputation of earnings at 32 hours per week under this subsection is a rebuttable presumption;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-time earnings at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where the parent resides if the parent has a recent history of minimum wage earnings, has never been employed and has no earnings history, or has no significant earnings history;</p>

If a parent who is currently enrolled in high school is determined to be voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed, the court shall impute income at earnings of 20 hours per week at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where that parent resides. Imputation of earnings at 20 hours per week under this subsection is a rebuttable presumption.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The basic child support obligation derived from the economic table shall be allocated between the parents based on each parent's share of the combined monthly net income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care costs are not included in the economic table. Monthly health care costs shall be shared by the parents in the same proportion as the basic child support obligation. Health care costs shall include, but not be limited to, medical, dental, orthodontia, vision, chiropractic, mental health treatment, prescription medications, and other similar costs for care and treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day care and special child rearing expenses, such as tuition and long-distance transportation costs to and from the parents for visitation purposes, are not included in the economic table. These expenses shall be shared by the parents in the same proportion as the basic child support obligation. If an obligor pays court or administratively ordered day care or special child rearing expenses that are not actually incurred, the obligee must reimburse the obligor for the overpayment if the overpayment amounts to at least 20 percent of the obligor's annual day care or special child rearing expenses. The obligor may institute an action in the superior court or file an application for an adjudicative hearing with the department of social and health services for reimbursement of day care and special child rearing expense overpayments that amount to 20 percent or more of the obligor's annual day care and special child rearing expenses. Any ordered overpayment reimbursement shall be applied first as an offset to child support arrearages of the obligor. If the obligor does not have child support arrearages, the reimbursement may be in the form of a direct reimbursement by the obligee or a credit against the obligor's future support payments. If the reimbursement is in the form of a credit against the obligor's future child support payments, the credit shall be spread equally over a 12-month period. Absent agreement of the obligee, nothing in this section entitles an obligor to pay more than his or her proportionate share of day care or other special child rearing expenses in advance and then deduct the overpayment from future support transfer payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory educational expenses and optional educational expenses are not included in the economic table. These expenses must be shared by the parents in the same proportion as the basic child support obligation.</p>

<p>When a child support order contains language providing for abatement based on incapacitation of the person required to pay child support, there is a rebuttable presumption that an incapacitated person is unable to pay the child support obligation.

</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the presumption is rebutted, the provisions of subsection (3) of this section apply.</p>

<p>If the court or administrative forum determines that abatement of support is appropriate:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The child support obligation under the order in front of the court will be abated to $50 per month per child while the person required to pay support is undergoing court-ordered behavioral health treatment.</p>

<li>
<p>Abatement of a child support obligation based on incapacitation of the person required to pay support does not constitute modification or adjustment of the order.</p>

<p>As used in this subsection and subsection (3) of this section, &quot;good cause not to require immediate income withholding&quot; means a written determination of why implementing immediate wage withholding would not be in the child's best interests and, in modification cases, proof of timely payment of previously ordered support.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In all other cases not under subsection (1) of this section, the court may order the person required to pay support to make payments directly to the person entitled to receive the payments, to the Washington state support registry, or may order that payments be made in accordance with an alternate arrangement agreed upon by the parties.</p>

<p>As used in this subsection, &quot;good cause not to require immediate income withholding&quot; is any reason that the court finds appropriate.</p>
<pre><code>b. The superior court may order immediate or delayed income withholding as follows:

    i. Immediate income withholding may be ordered if the person required to pay support has earnings. If immediate income withholding is ordered under this subsection, all support payments shall be paid to the Washington state support registry. The superior court shall issue a mandatory wage assignment order as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW when the support order is signed by the court. The payee under the order or the person entitled to receive the transfer payment is responsible for serving the employer with the order and for its enforcement as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW.

    ii. If immediate income withholding is not ordered, the court shall require that income withholding be delayed until a payment is past due. The support order shall contain a statement that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits, and liens enforced against real and personal property under the child support statutes of this or any other state, without further notice to the person required to pay support, after a payment is past due.

c. If a mandatory income withholding order under chapter 26.18 RCW is issued under this subsection and the division of child support provides support enforcement services under RCW 26.23.045, the existing wage withholding assignment is prospectively superseded upon the division of child support's subsequent service of an income withholding order.

<p>If both the person required to pay support and the person entitled to receive support fail to file an application within 20 days, the notice and finding shall become a final administrative order.

<p>If the person required to pay support or the person entitled to receive support files the application more than 20 days after, but within one year of the date of service, the office of administrative hearings shall schedule an adjudicative proceeding to hear the party's or parties' objection and determine the support obligation for the entire period covered by the notice and finding of financial responsibility.

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the presiding officer finds that good cause exists, the presiding officer shall proceed to hear the party's objection to the notice and determine the support obligation;</p>

The presiding officer shall determine the support obligation for the entire period covered by the notice, based upon credible evidence presented by the division of child support, the person required to pay support, or the person entitled to receive support, or may determine that the support obligation set forth in the notice is correct. The division of child support demonstrates good cause by showing that the support obligation was based upon imputed median net income, the grant standard, or the family need standard. The filing of the application by the division of child support does not stay further collection action, pending the entry of a final administrative order, and does not affect any prior collection action;</p>

<p>If an application for an adjudicative proceeding is filed, the presiding or reviewing officer shall determine the past liability and responsibility, if any, of the person required to pay support and shall also determine the amount of periodic payments to be made in the future, which amount is not limited by the amount of any public assistance payment made to or for the benefit of the child. If deviating from the child support schedule in making these determinations, the presiding or reviewing officer shall apply the standards contained in the child support schedule and enter written findings of fact supporting the deviation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If either the person required to pay support or the person entitled to receive support fails to attend or participate in the hearing or other stage of an adjudicative proceeding, upon a showing of valid service, the presiding officer shall enter an order of default against each party who did not appear and may enter an administrative order declaring the support debt and payment provisions stated in the notice and finding of financial responsibility to be assessed and determined and subject to collection action. The parties who appear may enter an agreed settlement or consent order, which may be different than the terms of the department's notice. Any party who appears may choose to proceed to the hearing, after the conclusion of which the presiding officer or reviewing officer may enter an order that is different than the terms stated in the notice, if the obligation is supported by credible evidence presented by any party at the hearing.</p>

<p>The final administrative order establishing liability and/or future periodic support payments shall be superseded upon entry of a superior court order for support to the extent the superior court order is inconsistent with the administrative order.</p>

The division of child support does not refund nor return any amounts collected under a notice that becomes final under this section or RCW 74.20A.055, even if a court later determines that the acknowledgment is void.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An acknowledged parent or other party to the notice who objects to the amount of support requested in the notice may file an application for an adjudicative proceeding up to 20 days after the date the notice was served. An application for an adjudicative proceeding may be filed within one year of service of the notice and finding of parental responsibility without the necessity for a showing of good cause or upon a showing of good cause thereafter. An adjudicative proceeding under this section shall be pursuant to RCW 74.20A.055. The only issues shall be the amount of the accrued debt and the amount of the current and future support obligation.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the application for an adjudicative proceeding is filed within 20 days of service of the notice, collection action shall be stayed pending a final decision by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the application for an adjudicative proceeding is not filed within 20 days of the service of the notice, any amounts collected under the notice shall be neither refunded nor returned if the person required to pay support under the notice is later found not to be required to pay support.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If neither the acknowledged parent nor the person entitled to receive support requests an adjudicative proceeding, or if no timely action is brought to rescind or challenge the acknowledgment or denial after service of the notice, the notice of financial responsibility becomes final for all intents and purposes and may be overturned only by a subsequent superior court order entered under RCW 26.26A.400 through 26.26A.515.</p>

<li>
<p>The department, the payee under the order or the person entitled to receive support, or the person required to pay support may petition for a prospective modification of a final administrative order if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The administrative order has not been superseded by a superior court order; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There has been a substantial change of circumstances, except as provided under RCW 74.20A.055(4)(d) or subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, the person entitled to receive support, the payee under the order, or : (a) The person required to pay support may petition for a prospective modification of a final administrative order if the person required to pay support is currently confined in a jail, prison, or correctional facility for at least six months or is serving a sentence greater than six months in a jail, prison, or correctional facility, and the support order does not contain language regarding abatement due to incarceration; or (b) the person required to pay support is currently undergoing court-ordered behavioral health treatment issued under chapter 71.05 RCW and the support order does not contain language regarding abatement due to incapacitation.</p>
<pre><code> i. The petition may be filed at any time after the administrative support order became a final order, as long as the person required to pay support is currently incarcerated or undergoing court-ordered behavioral health treatment.

 ii. As part of the petition for modification, the petitioner may also request that the support obligation be abated to $10 per month per order due to incarceration, as provided in RCW 26.09.320, or abated to $50 per month per child due to incapacitation, as provided in section 5 of this act.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order of child support may be modified at any time without a showing of substantially changed circumstances if incarceration of the person required to pay support is the basis for the inconsistency between the existing child support order amount and the amount of support determined as a result of a review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order of child support may be modified one year or more after it has been entered without showing a substantial change of circumstances:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the order in practice works a severe economic hardship on either party or the child; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a child is a full-time student and reasonably expected to complete secondary school or the equivalent level of vocational or technical training before the child becomes 19 years of age upon a finding that there is a need to extend support beyond the eighteenth birthday.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order may be modified without showing a substantial change of circumstances if the requested modification is to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Require medical support under RCW 26.09.105 for a child covered by the order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify an existing order for health care coverage; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify an existing order when the person required to pay support has been released from incarceration, as provided in RCW 26.09.320(3)(d), or when the person has been discharged from court-ordered behavioral health treatment issued under chapter 71.05 RCW, as provided in section 5 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support orders may be adjusted once every 24 months based upon changes in the income of the parties to the order without a showing of substantially changed circumstances. This provision does not mean that the income of a person entitled to receive support who is not a parent of the child or children covered by the order must be disclosed or be included in the calculations under chapter 26.19 RCW when determining the support obligation.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All administrative orders entered on, before, or after September 1, 1991, may be modified based upon changes in the child support schedule established in chapter 26.19 RCW without a substantial change of circumstances. The petition may be filed based on changes in the child support schedule after 12 months has expired from the entry of the administrative order or the most recent modification order setting child support, whichever is later. However, if a party is granted relief under this provision, 24 months must pass before another petition for modification may be filed pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, pursuant to subsection (6) of this section or (a) of this subsection, the order modifies a child support obligation by more than 30 percent and the change would cause significant hardship, the change may be implemented in two equal increments, one at the time of the entry of the order and the second six months from the entry of the order. Twenty-four months must pass following the second change before a petition for modification under subsection (6) of this section may be filed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An increase in the wage or salary of the person entitled to receive the support transfer payments is not a substantial change in circumstances for purposes of modification under subsection (1)(b) of this section. The voluntary unemployment or voluntary underemployment of the person required to pay support, by itself, is not a substantial change of circumstances. The income of the person entitled to receive support is only disclosed or considered if that person is a parent of the child or children covered by the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall file the petition and a supporting affidavit with the office of administrative hearings when the department petitions for modification.</p>

<p>The person required to pay support or the payee under the order or the person entitled to receive support shall follow the procedures in this chapter for filing an application for an adjudicative proceeding to petition for modification.</p>
