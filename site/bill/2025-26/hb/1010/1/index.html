<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washingtonians are in a housing crisis and the state needs to produce another 1.1 million homes by 2044 to meet its housing needs. The legislature also finds that accessory dwelling units provide affordable housing, can be built quickly, and can provide supplemental income for property owners. Accessory dwelling units are especially needed in rural communities that do not yet have the infrastructure for larger scale development. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide pathways for the construction of accessory dwelling units in both urban and rural areas.</p>

<li>
<p>A county or a city may use a variety of innovative zoning techniques in areas designated as agricultural lands of long-term commercial significance under RCW 36.70A.170. The innovative zoning techniques should be designed to conserve agricultural lands and encourage the agricultural economy. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a county or city should encourage nonagricultural uses to be limited to lands with poor soils or otherwise not suitable for agricultural purposes.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that counties are regional governments within their boundaries, and cities are primary providers of urban governmental services within urban growth areas. For the purposes of this section, a &quot;countywide planning policy&quot; is a written policy statement or statements used solely for establishing a countywide framework from which county and city comprehensive plans are developed and adopted pursuant to this chapter. This framework shall ensure that city and county comprehensive plans are consistent as required in RCW 36.70A.100. Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the land-use powers of cities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative authority of a county that plans under RCW 36.70A.040 shall adopt a countywide planning policy in cooperation with the cities located in whole or in part within the county as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No later than 60 calendar days from July 16, 1991, the legislative authority of each county that as of June 1, 1991, was required or chose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall convene a meeting with representatives of each city located within the county for the purpose of establishing a collaborative process that will provide a framework for the adoption of a countywide planning policy. In other counties that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, this meeting shall be convened no later than 60 days after the date the county adopts its resolution of intention or was certified by the office of financial management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process and framework for adoption of a countywide planning policy specified in (a) of this subsection shall determine the manner in which the county and the cities agree to all procedures and provisions including but not limited to desired planning policies, deadlines, ratification of final agreements and demonstration thereof, and financing, if any, of all activities associated therewith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a county fails for any reason to convene a meeting with representatives of cities as required in (a) of this subsection, the governor may immediately impose any appropriate sanction or sanctions on the county from those specified under RCW 36.70A.340.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no agreement by October 1, 1991, in a county that was required or chose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 as of June 1, 1991, or if there is no agreement within 120 days of the date the county adopted its resolution of intention or was certified by the office of financial management in any other county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, the governor shall first inquire of the jurisdictions as to the reason or reasons for failure to reach an agreement. If the governor deems it appropriate, the governor may immediately request the assistance of the department of commerce to mediate any disputes that preclude agreement. If mediation is unsuccessful in resolving all disputes that will lead to agreement, the governor may impose appropriate sanctions from those specified under RCW 36.70A.340 on the county, city, or cities for failure to reach an agreement as provided in this section. The governor shall specify the reason or reasons for the imposition of any sanction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than July 1, 1992, the legislative authority of each county that was required or chose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 as of June 1, 1991, or no later than 14 months after the date the county adopted its resolution of intention or was certified by the office of financial management the county legislative authority of any other county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, shall adopt a countywide planning policy according to the process provided under this section and that is consistent with the agreement pursuant to (b) of this subsection, and after holding a public hearing or hearings on the proposed countywide planning policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A countywide planning policy shall at a minimum, address the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Policies to implement RCW 36.70A.110;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for promotion of contiguous and orderly development and provision of urban services to such development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for siting public capital facilities of a countywide or statewide nature, including transportation facilities of statewide significance as defined in RCW 47.06.140;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for countywide transportation facilities and strategies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies that consider the need for affordable housing, such as housing for all economic segments of the population and parameters for its distribution;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for joint county and city planning within urban growth areas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies for countywide economic development and employment, which must include consideration of the future development of commercial and industrial facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An analysis of the fiscal impact; and</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Policies that address the protection of tribal cultural resources in collaboration with federally recognized Indian tribes that are invited pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, provided that a tribe, or more than one tribe, chooses to participate in the process.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal agencies and federally recognized Indian tribes whose reservation or ceded lands lie within the county shall be invited to participate in and cooperate with the countywide planning policy adoption process. Adopted countywide planning policies shall be adhered to by state agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to adopt a countywide planning policy that meets the requirements of this section may result in the imposition of a sanction or sanctions on a county or city within the county, as specified in RCW 36.70A.340. In imposing a sanction or sanctions, the governor shall specify the reasons for failure to adopt a countywide planning policy in order that any imposed sanction or sanctions are fairly and equitably related to the failure to adopt a countywide planning policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities and the governor may appeal an adopted countywide planning policy to the growth management hearings board within 60 days of the adoption of the countywide planning policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multicounty planning policies shall be adopted by two or more counties, each with a population of 450,000 or more, with contiguous urban areas and may be adopted by other counties, according to the process established under this section or other processes agreed to among the counties and cities within the affected counties throughout the multicounty region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The countywide planning policy or multicounty planning policy for any county that authorizes the development of detached accessory dwelling units in rural areas under section 2 of this act must be amended, at its next regularly scheduled update, to allow development of detached accessory dwelling units in rural areas consistent with section 2 of this act. Population growth from the development of detached accessory dwelling units that comply with the requirements of section 2(1) of this act may not be counted for the purpose of determining whether a county is achieving rural or urban growth targets contained in a countywide planning policy or multicounty planning policy.</p>
