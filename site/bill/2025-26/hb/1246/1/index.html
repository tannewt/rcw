<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Complaints referred to the juvenile court alleging the commission of an offense shall be referred directly to the prosecutor. The prosecutor, upon receipt of a complaint, shall screen the complaint to determine whether:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The alleged facts bring the case within the jurisdiction of the court; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a basis of available evidence there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile did commit the offense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the identical alleged acts constitute an offense under both the law of this state and an ordinance of any city or county of this state, state law shall govern the prosecutor's screening and charging decision for both filed and diverted cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the requirements of subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section are met, the prosecutor shall either file an information in juvenile court or divert the case, as set forth in subsections (5), (6), and (8) of this section. If the prosecutor finds that the requirements of subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section are not met, the prosecutor shall maintain a record, for one year, of such decision and the reasons therefor. In lieu of filing an information or diverting an offense a prosecutor may file a motion to modify community supervision where such offense constitutes a violation of community supervision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An information shall be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall be signed by the prosecuting attorney and conform to chapter 10.37 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prosecutor shall file an information with the juvenile court if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An alleged offender is accused of an offense that is defined as a sex offense or violent offense under RCW 9.94A.030, other than assault in the second degree or robbery in the second degree;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alleged offender has been referred by a diversion unit for prosecution or desires prosecution instead of diversion; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alleged offender has three or more diversion agreements on the alleged offender's criminal history.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a case is legally sufficient the prosecutor shall divert the case if the alleged offense is a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor or violation and the alleged offense is the offender's first offense or violation. If the alleged offender is charged with a related offense that may be filed under subsections (5) and (8) of this section, a case under this subsection may also be filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a case is legally sufficient to charge an alleged offender with:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Prostitution loitering and the alleged offense is the offender's first prostitution loitering offense, the prosecutor shall divert the case;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voyeurism in the second degree, the offender is under 17 years of age, and the alleged offense is the offender's first voyeurism in the second degree offense, the prosecutor shall divert the case, unless the offender has received two diversions for any offense in the previous two years;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor selling depictions of himself or herself engaged in sexually explicit conduct under RCW 9.68A.053(5) and the alleged offense is the offender's first violation of RCW 9.68A.053(5), the prosecutor shall divert the case; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A distribution, transfer, dissemination, or exchange of sexually explicit images of other minors 13 years of age or older offense as provided in RCW 9.68A.053(1) and the alleged offense is the offender's first violation of RCW 9.68A.053(1), the prosecutor shall divert the case.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a case is legally sufficient and falls into neither subsection (5) nor (6) of this section, it may be filed or diverted. In deciding whether to file or divert an offense under this section the prosecutor may be guided by the length, seriousness, and recency of the alleged offender's criminal history and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a juvenile is placed in custody or, where not placed in custody, referred to a diversion interview, the parent or legal guardian of the juvenile shall be notified as soon as possible concerning the allegation made against the juvenile and the current status of the juvenile. Where a case involves victims of crimes against persons or victims whose property has not been recovered at the time a juvenile is referred to a diversion unit, the victim shall be notified of the referral and informed how to contact the unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The responsibilities of the prosecutor under subsections (1) through (9) of this section may be performed by a juvenile court probation counselor for any complaint referred to the court alleging the commission of an offense which would not be a felony if committed by an adult, if the prosecutor has given sufficient written notice to the juvenile court that the prosecutor will not review such complaints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prosecutor, juvenile court probation counselor, or diversion unit may, in exercising their authority under this section or RCW 13.40.080, refer juveniles to community-based programs, restorative justice programs, mediation, or victim offender reconciliation programs. Such mediation or victim offender reconciliation programs shall be voluntary for victims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prosecutors and juvenile courts are encouraged to engage with and partner with community-based programs to expand, improve, and increase options to divert youth from formal processing in juvenile court. Nothing in this chapter should be read to limit partnership with community-based programs to create diversion opportunities for juveniles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A diversion agreement shall be a contract between a juvenile accused of an offense and a diversion unit whereby the juvenile agrees to fulfill certain conditions in lieu of prosecution. Such agreements may be entered into only after the prosecutor, or probation counselor pursuant to this chapter, has determined that probable cause exists to believe that a crime has been committed and that the juvenile committed it. Such agreements shall be entered into as expeditiously as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion agreement shall be limited to one or more of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Community restitution not to exceed 150 hours, not to be performed during school hours if the juvenile is attending school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restitution limited to the amount of actual loss incurred by any victim, excluding restitution owed to any insurance provider under Title 48 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attendance at up to 10 hours of counseling and/or up to twenty hours of positive youth development, educational or informational sessions at a community agency. The educational or informational sessions may include sessions relating to respect for self, others, and authority; victim awareness; accountability; self-worth; responsibility; work ethics; good citizenship; literacy; and life skills. If an assessment identifies mental health or chemical dependency needs, a youth may access up to 30 hours of counseling. The counseling sessions may include services demonstrated to improve behavioral health and reduce recidivism.  The state shall not be liable for costs resulting from the diversion unit exercising the option to permit diversion agreements to mandate attendance at up to 30 hours of counseling and/or up to 20 hours of educational or informational sessions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements to remain during specified hours at home, school, or work, and restrictions on leaving or entering specified geographical areas; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon request of any victim or witness, requirements to refrain from any contact with victims or witnesses of offenses committed by the juvenile.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, youth courts are not limited to the conditions imposed by subsection (2) of this section in imposing sanctions on juveniles pursuant to RCW 13.40.630.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In assessing periods of community restitution to be performed and restitution to be paid by a juvenile who has entered into a diversion agreement, the court officer to whom this task is assigned shall consult with the juvenile's custodial parent or parents or guardian. To the extent possible, the court officer shall advise the victims of the juvenile offender of the diversion process, offer victim impact letter forms and restitution claim forms, and involve members of the community. Such members of the community may meet with the juvenile and may advise the court officer as to the terms of the diversion agreement and may supervise the juvenile in carrying out its terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A diversion agreement may not exceed a period of six months and may include a period extending beyond the eighteenth birthday of the divertee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If additional time is necessary for the juvenile to complete the terms of the agreement or restitution to a victim, the time period limitations of this subsection may be extended by an additional six months at the request of the juvenile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the juvenile has not paid the full amount of restitution by the end of the additional six-month period, then the juvenile shall be referred to the juvenile court for entry of a civil order establishing the amount of restitution still owed to the victim. In this order, the court shall also determine the terms and conditions of the restitution, including a payment plan extending up to ten years if the court determines that the juvenile does not have the means to make full restitution over a shorter period. For the purposes of this subsection (5)(c), the juvenile shall remain under the court's jurisdiction for a maximum term of 10 years after the juvenile's 18th birthday. Prior to the expiration of the initial ten-year period, the juvenile court may extend the judgment for restitution an additional 10 years. The court may relieve the juvenile of the requirement to pay full or partial restitution if the juvenile reasonably satisfies the court that he or she does not have the means to make full or partial restitution and could not reasonably acquire the means to pay the restitution over a 10-year period. If the court relieves the juvenile of the requirement to pay full or partial restitution, the court may order an amount of community restitution that the court deems appropriate. The county clerk shall make disbursements to victims named in the order. The restitution to victims named in the order shall be paid prior to any payment for other penalties or monetary assessments. A juvenile under obligation to pay restitution may petition the court for modification of the restitution order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion agreement may be completed by the juvenile any time prior to an order terminating the agreement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile shall retain the right to be referred to the court at any time prior to the signing of the diversion agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divertees and potential divertees shall be afforded due process in all contacts with a diversion unit regardless of whether the juveniles are accepted for diversion or whether the diversion program is successfully completed. Such due process shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A written diversion agreement shall be executed stating all conditions in clearly understandable language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of the terms of the agreement shall be the only grounds for termination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No divertee may be terminated from a diversion program without being given a court hearing, which hearing shall be preceded by:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Written notice of alleged violations of the conditions of the diversion program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclosure of all evidence to be offered against the divertee;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hearing shall be conducted by the juvenile court and shall include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Opportunity to be heard in person and to present evidence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to confront and cross-examine all adverse witnesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A written statement by the court as to the evidence relied on and the reasons for termination, should that be the decision; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstration by evidence that the divertee has substantially violated the terms of his or her diversion agreement;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prosecutor may file an information on the offense for which the divertee was diverted:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>In juvenile court if the divertee is under 18 years of age; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In superior court or the appropriate court of limited jurisdiction if the divertee is 18 years of age or older.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diversion unit shall, subject to available funds, be responsible for providing interpreters when juveniles need interpreters to effectively communicate during diversion unit hearings or negotiations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diversion unit shall be responsible for advising a divertee of his or her rights as provided in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diversion unit may refer a juvenile to a restorative justice program, community-based counseling, or treatment programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to counsel shall inure prior to the initial interview for purposes of advising the juvenile as to whether he or she desires to participate in the diversion process or to appear in the juvenile court. The juvenile may be represented by counsel at any critical stage of the diversion process, including intake interviews and termination hearings. The juvenile shall be fully advised at the intake of his or her right to an attorney and of the relevant services an attorney can provide. For the purpose of this section, intake interviews mean all interviews regarding the diversion agreement process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The juvenile shall be advised that a diversion agreement shall constitute a part of the juvenile's criminal history as defined by RCW 13.40.020(8). A signed acknowledgment of such advisement shall be obtained from the juvenile, and the document shall be maintained by the diversion unit together with the diversion agreement, and a copy of both documents shall be delivered to the prosecutor if requested by the prosecutor. The supreme court shall promulgate rules setting forth the content of such advisement in simple language.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<p>When a juvenile enters into a diversion agreement, the juvenile court may receive only the following information for dispositional purposes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The fact that a charge or charges were made;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that a diversion agreement was entered into;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The juvenile's obligations under such agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the alleged offender performed his or her obligations under such agreement; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facts of the alleged offense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion unit may refuse to enter into a diversion agreement with a juvenile. When a diversion unit refuses to enter a diversion agreement with a juvenile, it shall immediately refer such juvenile to the court for action and shall forward to the court the criminal complaint and a detailed statement of its reasons for refusing to enter into a diversion agreement. The diversion unit shall also immediately refer the case to the prosecuting attorney for action if such juvenile violates the terms of the diversion agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion unit may, in instances where it determines that the act or omission of an act for which a juvenile has been referred to it involved no victim, or where it determines that the juvenile referred to it has no prior criminal history and is alleged to have committed an illegal act involving no threat of or instance of actual physical harm and involving not more than fifty dollars in property loss or damage and that there is no loss outstanding to the person or firm suffering such damage or loss, counsel and release or release such a juvenile without entering into a diversion agreement. A diversion unit's authority to counsel and release a juvenile under this subsection includes the authority to refer the juvenile to community-based counseling or treatment programs or a restorative justice program. Any juvenile released under this subsection shall be advised that the act or omission of any act for which he or she had been referred shall constitute a part of the juvenile's criminal history as defined by RCW 13.40.020(8). A signed acknowledgment of such advisement shall be obtained from the juvenile, and the document shall be maintained by the unit, and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the prosecutor if requested by the prosecutor. The supreme court shall promulgate rules setting forth the content of such advisement in simple language. A juvenile determined to be eligible by a diversion unit for release as provided in this subsection shall retain the same right to counsel and right to have his or her case referred to the court for formal action as any other juvenile referred to the unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A diversion unit may supervise the fulfillment of a diversion agreement entered into before the juvenile's eighteenth birthday and which includes a period extending beyond the divertee's eighteenth birthday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If restitution required by a diversion agreement cannot reasonably be paid due to a change of circumstance, the diversion agreement may be modified at the request of the divertee and with the concurrence of the diversion unit to convert unpaid restitution into community restitution. The modification of the diversion agreement shall be in writing and signed by the divertee and the diversion unit. The number of hours of community restitution in lieu of a monetary penalty shall be converted at the rate of the prevailing state minimum wage per hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A community agency contracted to provide services to a juvenile as part of a diversion agreement that falsifies information or does not accurately report juvenile attendance or juvenile progress is subject to a fine of up to $25,000 enforceable by the office of the attorney general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;community agency&quot; may also mean a community-based nonprofit organization, a physician, a counselor, a school, or a treatment provider, if approved by the diversion unit.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The vertical axis of the grid is the current offense category. The current offense category is determined by the offense of adjudication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The horizontal axis of the grid is the number of prior adjudications included in the juvenile's criminal history. Each prior felony adjudication shall count as one point. Each prior violation, misdemeanor, and gross misdemeanor adjudication shall count as 1/4 point. Fractional points shall be rounded down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The standard range disposition for each offense is determined by the intersection of the column defined by the prior adjudications and the row defined by the current offense category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RCW 13.40.180 applies if the offender is being sentenced for more than one offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A current offense that is a violation is equivalent to an offense category of E. However, a disposition for a violation shall not include confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender is subject to a standard range disposition involving confinement by the department, the court may impose the standard range and suspend the disposition on condition that the offender comply with one or more local sanctions and any educational or treatment requirement. The treatment programs provided to the offender must be either research-based best practice programs as identified by the Washington state institute for public policy or the joint legislative audit and review committee, or for chemical dependency treatment programs or services, they must be evidence-based or research-based best practice programs. For the purposes of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Evidence-based&quot; means a program or practice that has had multiple site random controlled trials across heterogeneous populations demonstrating that the program or practice is effective for the population; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Research-based&quot; means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the offender fails to comply with the suspended disposition, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or may revoke the suspended disposition and order the disposition's execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offender is ineligible for the suspended disposition option under this section if the offender:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Is adjudicated of an A+ or A++ offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is 14 years of age or older and is adjudicated of one or more of the following offenses:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Violation of the uniform controlled substances act (RCW 69.50.401(2) (a) and (b)), when the offense includes infliction of bodily harm upon another or when during the commission or immediate withdrawal from the offense the respondent was armed with a deadly weapon;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Has a prior option B disposition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed a B++ or B+ offense, the court may impose a disposition under RCW 13.40.160(4) and 13.40.165.</p>
<p>If the court determines that a disposition under option A, B, or C would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition outside the standard range under RCW 13.40.160(2).</p>

<li>
<p>If a respondent is found to have been in possession of a firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040, the disposition must include a requirement that the respondent participate in a qualifying program as described in (b) of this subsection, when available, unless the court makes a written finding based on the outcome of the juvenile court risk assessment that participation in a qualifying program would not be appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;qualifying program&quot; means an aggression replacement training program, a functional family therapy program, or another program applicable to the juvenile firearm offender population that has been identified as evidence-based or research-based and cost-beneficial in the current list prepared at the direction of the legislature by the Washington state institute for public policy.</p>

<li>
<p>If the court finds that the respondent or an accomplice was armed with a firearm, the court shall determine the standard range disposition for the offense pursuant to RCW 13.40.160. If the offender or an accomplice was armed with a firearm when the offender committed any felony other than possession of a machine gun or bump-fire stock, possession of a stolen firearm, drive-by shooting, theft of a firearm, unlawful possession of a firearm in the first and second degree, or use of a machine gun or bump-fire stock in a felony, the following periods of total confinement must be added to the sentence: (a) Except for (b) of this subsection, for a class A felony, six months; for a class B felony, four months; and for a class C felony, two months; (b) for any violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, committed by a respondent who is 16 or 17 years old at the time of the offense, a period of 12 months.

The additional time must be imposed regardless of the offense's juvenile disposition offense category as designated in RCW 13.40.0357 and must be served consecutively with any other sentencing enhancement.</p>

When a judge finds a manifest injustice and imposes a disposition of confinement exceeding 30 days, the court shall commit the juvenile to a maximum term, and the provisions of RCW 13.40.030(2) shall be used to determine the range. When a judge finds a manifest injustice and imposes a disposition of confinement less than thirty days, the disposition shall be comprised of confinement or community supervision or both.</p>
