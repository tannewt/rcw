## Section 1
1. Whenever any person is convicted as an adult in the courts of this state of a felony offense committed under the age of 18, and is committed for a term of confinement, that person shall be initially placed in a facility operated by the department of  corrections to determine the person's earned release date.

    a. If the earned release date is prior to the person's 21st birthday, the department of corrections shall transfer the person to the custody of the department of children, youth, and families until the person completes the ordered term of confinement or arrives at the age of 21.

    b. While in the custody of the department of children, youth, and families, the person must have the same treatment, housing options, transfer, and access to program resources as any other person committed to that juvenile correctional facility or institution pursuant to chapter 13.40 RCW. Except as provided under (e) of this subsection, treatment, placement, and program decisions shall be at the sole discretion of the department of children, youth, and families. The person shall not be transferred to the custody of the department of corrections without the approval of the department of children, youth, and families until the person reaches the age of 21.

    c. If the person's sentence includes a term of community custody, the department of children, youth, and families shall not release the person to community custody until the department of corrections has approved the person's release plan pursuant to RCW 9.94A.729(5)(b). If a person is held past his or her earned release date pending release plan approval, the department of children, youth, and families shall retain custody until a plan is approved or the person completes the ordered term of confinement prior to age 21.

    d. If the department of children, youth, and families determines that retaining custody of the person in a facility of the department of children, youth, and families presents a significant safety risk, the department of children, youth, and families may transfer the person to the custody of the department of corrections.

    e. The department of corrections must retain authority over custody decisions relating to a person whose earned release date is on or after the person's 21st birthday and who is placed in a facility operated by the department of children, youth, and families under this section, unless the person qualifies for partial confinement under RCW 72.01.412, and must approve any leave from the facility. When the person turns age 21, he or she must be transferred to the department of corrections, except as described under RCW 72.01.412. The department of children, youth, and families has all routine and day-to-day operations authority for the person while the person is in its custody.

    a. Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, a person under the age of 18 who is transferred to the custody of the department of corrections must be placed in a housing unit, or a portion of a housing unit, that is separated from other persons in custody who are 18 years of age or older, until the person reaches the age of 18.

    b. A person who is transferred to the custody of the department of corrections and reaches 18 years of age may remain in a housing unit for persons under the age of 18 if the secretary of corrections determines that: (i) The person's needs and the rehabilitation goals for the person could continue to be better met by the programs and housing environment that is separate from other persons in custody who are 18 years of age and older; and (ii) the programs or housing environment for persons under the age of 18 will not be substantially affected by the continued placement of the person in that environment. The person may remain placed in a housing unit for persons under the age of 18 until such time as the secretary of corrections determines that the person's needs and goals are no longer better met in that environment but in no case past the person's 21st birthday.

    c. A person transferred to the custody of the department of corrections who is under the age of 18 may be housed in an intensive management unit or administrative segregation unit containing offenders 18 years of age or older if it is necessary for the safety or security of the offender or staff. In these cases, the offender must be kept physically separate from other offenders at all times.
