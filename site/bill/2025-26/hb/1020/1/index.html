<ol>
<li>
<p>This section and RCW 28A.175.105 through 28A.175.115 provide a statutory framework for a statewide dropout reengagement system to provide appropriate educational opportunities and access to services for eligible students as defined in RCW 28A.175.105.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the system, school districts may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enter into the model interlocal agreement developed under RCW 28A.175.110 with an educational service district, community or technical college, or other public entity to provide a dropout reengagement program for eligible students of the district; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter into the model contract developed under RCW 28A.175.110 with a community-based organization to provide a dropout reengagement program for eligible students of the district.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a school district does not enter an interlocal agreement or contract with an educational service district, community or technical college, other public entity, or community-based organization to provide a dropout reengagement program for eligible students residing in the district, the educational service district, community or technical college, other public entity, or community-based organization may petition a school district other than the resident school district to enroll the eligible students under RCW 28A.225.220 through 28A.225.230 and enter the interlocal agreement or contract with the petitioning entity to provide a dropout reengagement program for the eligible students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not affect the authority of school districts to contract for educational services under RCW 28A.150.305 and 28A.320.035. This section also does not affect the authority of school districts to offer dropout reengagement programs or other educational services for eligible students directly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

A dropout reengagement program is not required to offer instruction in only those subject areas where a student is deficient in accumulated credits. Academic instruction must be provided by teachers certified by the Washington professional educator standards board or by instructors employed by a community or technical college whose required credentials are established by the college;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case management, academic and career counseling, and assistance with accessing services and resources that support at-risk youth and reduce barriers to educational success; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the program provider is a community or technical college, the opportunity for qualified students to enroll in college courses that lead to a postsecondary degree or certificate. The college may not charge an eligible student tuition for such enrollment.</p>

<li>
<p>&quot;Eligible student&quot; means a student who:</p>
<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>Is not accumulating sufficient credits toward a high school diploma to reasonably complete a high school diploma from a public school before the age of 21, or is recommended for the program by case managers from the department of social and health services or the juvenile justice system; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is enrolled or enrolls in the school district in which the student resides, or is enrolled or enrolls in an institutional education program as defined in RCW 28A.190.005 or a nonresident school district under RCW 28A.225.220 through 28A.225.230.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Full-time equivalent eligible student&quot; means an eligible student whose enrollment and attendance meet criteria adopted by the office of the superintendent of public instruction specifically for dropout reengagement programs. The criteria shall be:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Based on the community or technical college credits generated by the student if the program provider is a community or technical college; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on a minimum amount of planned programming or instruction and minimum attendance by the student rather than hours of seat time if the program provider is a community-based organization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
