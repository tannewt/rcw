</li>

<li>
<p>Hold and maintain an active home state license as a respiratory therapist;</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>The compact privilege is valid until the expiration date or revocation of the home state license unless terminated pursuant to adverse action. The licensee must comply with all of the requirements of subsection (1) of this section to maintain the compact privilege in a remote state. If those requirements are met, no adverse actions are taken, and the licensee has paid any applicable compact privilege renewal fees, then the licensee will maintain the licensee's compact privilege.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee providing respiratory therapy in a remote state under the compact privilege shall function within the scope of practice authorized by the remote state for the type of respiratory therapist license the licensee holds.

<li>
<p>If a home state license is encumbered, the licensee shall lose the compact privilege in all remote states until the following occur:</p>
