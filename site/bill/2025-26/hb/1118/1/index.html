<ol>
<li>
<p>A person who is prohibited from possession of a firearm under RCW 9.41.040 may not petition a court to have the person's right to possess a firearm restored if the person has been convicted or found not guilty by reason of insanity of: A felony sex offense; a class A felony; or a felony offense with a maximum sentence of at least 20 years, other than sentences under RCW 69.50.408 or 69.50.435.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who is prohibited from possession of a firearm under RCW 9.41.040, and is not disqualified from petitioning for restoration of firearm rights under subsection (1) of this section or required to petition as provided for in RCW 9.41.047, may petition a superior court to have the person's right to possess a firearm restored.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The person must have, for the period of consecutive years as specified below immediately preceding the filing of the petition, been in the community without being convicted or found not guilty by reason of insanity of any crime that prohibits the possession of a firearm, as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Five years for a conviction or finding of not guilty by reason of insanity for any felony offense, or any of the following gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor offenses:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Domestic violence (RCW 10.99.020);</p>
<p>(B) Stalking;</p>
<p>(C) Cyberstalking;</p>
<p>(D) Cyber harassment, excluding cyber harassment committed solely pursuant to the element set forth in RCW 9A.90.120(1)(a)(i);</p>
<p>(E) Harassment;</p>

<p>(H) Animal cruelty in the second degree committed under RCW 16.52.207(1);</p>
<p>(I) Prior offense as defined by RCW 46.61.5055; or</p>
<p>(J) Violation of the provisions of an order to surrender and prohibit weapons, an extreme risk protection order, or the provisions of a protection order or no-contact order restraining the person or excluding the person from a residence; and</p>
<pre><code>    ii. Three years for a conviction or finding of not guilty by reason of insanity for one or more nonfelony crimes not covered in (a)(i) of this subsection.

b. The person petitioning for firearm rights to be restored must also meet the following requirements:

    i. Has no pending charges for any felony, gross misdemeanor, or misdemeanor crime at the time the petition is filed or during the petition process;

    ii. Has completed all sentencing conditions, other than nonrestitution fines and fees, for each felony, gross misdemeanor, or misdemeanor conviction on which the prohibition was based, including all court-ordered treatment. The court shall waive the requirement of this subsection (2)(b)(ii) if the petitioner provides verification from the sentencing court that relevant court records are no longer available, or attests to the unavailability of relevant records from other entities;

    iii. Has no prior felony convictions that would count as part of an offender score under RCW 9.94A.525 and has no out-of-state conviction for an offense which would disqualify the person from purchasing or possessing a firearm in the state of conviction. This determination shall be the responsibility of, and conducted by, the prosecuting attorney. An individual shall not be precluded from filing a petition to restore their firearm rights on the basis that they cannot verify whether they are disqualified from purchasing or possessing a firearm in the state of conviction; and
