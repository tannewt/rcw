</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The health care setting must submit a report to the committee identified under RCW 49.19.020(1)(b) at least quarterly, unless the health care setting is a critical access hospital under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395i-4, in which case it must submit a report at least twice per year, with the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
