The move ahead WA account is created in the motor vehicle fund. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account must be used only for projects or improvements identified as move ahead WA projects or improvements in an omnibus transportation appropriations act, including any principal and interest on bonds authorized for the projects or improvements. During the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium, the legislature may direct the state treasurer to make transfers of moneys from the move ahead WA account to the motor vehicle fund and the transportation 2003 account (nickel account).

## Section 602
1. Beginning July 1, 2024, an eligible commissioned employee completing 26 or more years of service shall qualify for an annual state trooper longevity bonus of $15,000 on the employee's anniversary date of state employment, which shall be paid in four equal quarterly payments. However, during the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium, an eligible commissioned employee who completed 26 or more years of service prior to July 1, 2024, shall receive payment on the first paydate following the effective date of this section of any amount of the longevity bonus that would have been paid to the eligible commissioned employee as of the effective date of this section had quarterly payments begun on July 1, 2024.

2. The establishment of the state trooper longevity bonus is subject to a change to the applicable collective bargaining agreements negotiated with the exclusive bargaining representatives.

3. This section does not interfere with, impede, or in any way diminish the right of the officers of the Washington state patrol to bargain collectively with the state through the exclusive bargaining representatives as provided for in RCW 41.56.473.

4. The state patrol longevity bonus created in this section is a time-limited incentive targeted at retaining senior personnel and is not intended to be included in salary or average final salary for calculation of pension benefits in this chapter.

5. The benefits provided pursuant to chapter 237, Laws of 2024 are not provided to employees as a matter of contractual right. The legislature retains the right to alter or abolish these benefits at any time.

6. Beginning July 15, 2024, and every three months thereafter, the Washington state patrol must submit a report showing the average filled positions in field force trooper positions in comparison to the 683 total authorized field force trooper positions in the prior fiscal quarter. The quarterly reports detailed must be submitted to the office of financial management and the transportation committees of the legislature. The authorized field force trooper level as the basis for this comparison may be adjusted as specified in the omnibus transportation appropriations act.

7. For the purposes of this section, "eligible commissioned employee" means a Washington state patrol employee with 26 or more years of service in the Washington state patrol retirement system.

8. This section expires June 30, 2029.

## Section 701
The appropriations to the department of transportation in chapter 472, Laws of 2023, chapter 310, Laws of 2024, and this act must be expended for the programs and in the amounts specified in chapter 472, Laws of 2023, chapter 310, Laws of 2024, and this act. However, after May 1, 2025, unless specifically prohibited, the department may transfer state appropriations for the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium among operating programs after approval by the director of the office of financial management. However, the department shall not transfer state moneys that are provided solely for a specific purpose. The department shall not transfer funds, and the director of the office of financial management shall not approve the transfer, unless the transfer is consistent with the objective of conserving, to the maximum extent possible, the expenditure of state funds and not federal funds. The director of the office of financial management shall notify the appropriate transportation committees of the legislature prior to approving any allotment modifications or transfers under this section.

## Section 702
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.

## Section 703
This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.
