The account shall consist of funds appropriated by the legislature for the programs listed in this subsection and private contributions to the programs. Moneys deposited in the account do not lapse at the close of the fiscal period for which they were appropriated. Both during and after the fiscal period in which moneys were deposited in the account, the office may expend moneys in the account only for the purposes for which they were appropriated, and the expenditures are subject to any other conditions or limitations placed on the appropriations.

3. Expenditures from the account shall be used for scholarships to students eligible for the programs according to program rules and policies. For the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium, expenditures may also be used for scholarship awards in the passport to career program established under chapter 28B.117 RCW. It is the intent of the legislature that this policy will be continued in subsequent fiscal biennia.

4. Disbursements from the account are exempt from appropriations and the allotment provisions of chapter 43.88 RCW.

5. Only the director of the office or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account.

6. During the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium, the legislature may direct the state treasurer to transfer money in the state financial aid account to the state general fund.

## Section 902

During the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium, the legislature may direct the state treasurer to transfer money in the military department active state service account to the state general fund.

## Section 906
The industrial insurance premium refund account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All industrial insurance refunds earned by state agencies or institutions of higher education under the state fund retrospective rating program shall be deposited into the account. The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but no appropriation is required for expenditures from the account. Only the executive head of the agency or institution of higher education, or designee, may authorize expenditures from the account. No agency or institution of higher education may make an expenditure from the account for an amount greater than the refund earned by the agency. If the agency or institution of higher education has staff dedicated to workers' compensation claims management, expenditures from the account must be used to pay for that staff, but additional expenditure from the account may be used for any program within an agency or institution of higher education that promotes or provides incentives for employee workplace safety and health and early, appropriate return-to-work for injured employees. During the 2009-2011 fiscal biennium, the legislature may transfer from the industrial insurance premium refund account to the state general fund such amounts as reflect the excess fund balance of the account. During the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium, the legislature may direct the state treasurer to transfer money in the industrial insurance premium refund account to the state general fund.
