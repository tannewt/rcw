<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state is in the top rankings for auto thefts in the nation. The legislature further finds that chop shops are prevalent and flourishing, and Washington state does not currently provide law enforcement adequate tools to stop the illegal destruction of cars that profit criminals. The legislature further finds that automobile insurance rates have increased for everyone due to the criminal activity in the state.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to implement new provisions to hold criminals accountable and to provide restitution to the victims of these crimes.</p>
