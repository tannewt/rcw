# HB 1086 - Motor vehicle chop shops

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1086.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington state is in the top rankings for auto thefts in the nation. The legislature further finds that chop shops are prevalent and flourishing, and Washington state does not currently provide law enforcement adequate tools to stop the illegal destruction of cars that profit criminals. The legislature further finds that automobile insurance rates have increased for everyone due to the criminal activity in the state.

Therefore, the legislature intends to implement new provisions to hold criminals accountable and to provide restitution to the victims of these crimes.

## Section 2
1. Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, it is unlawful for any person to knowingly own, operate, or conduct a chop shop, or to knowingly aid and abet another person in owning, operating, or conducting a chop shop.

3. A person who is convicted of violating this section, in addition to any other punishment, shall be ordered to make restitution to the lawful owner of the stolen motor vehicle, major component part, or other part, or to the owner's insurer if the owner has already been compensated for the loss by the insurer, for any financial loss sustained as a result of the theft of the motor vehicle or part, any environmental clean-up costs stemming from the illegal activity, and any other related costs as authorized by RCW 9.94A.750.

    b. The lawful owner or any other authorized possessor of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle part that has been recovered by law enforcement authorities after having been stolen.
