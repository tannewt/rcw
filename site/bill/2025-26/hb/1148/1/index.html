<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that youth athletic facilities play a crucial role in promoting physical fitness, teamwork, and social development among young people. These facilities offer safe and structured environments for children to engage in sports and recreational activities, fostering healthier lifestyles and reducing the risks of childhood obesity and related health concerns.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that implementing a sales and use tax on youth athletic facility goods and services increases the financial burden on families and organizations that support youth sports. This could lead to reduced access to these essential facilities, particularly in underserved communities, where affordability is already a significant barrier.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that exempting goods and services provided by youth athletic facilities from sales and use taxes encourages the growth and maintenance of such facilities, supporting local economies by attracting tournaments, events, and visitors. These activities not only create revenue for surrounding businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and retail establishments, but they also position the state as a hub for sports tourism, driving economic activity and job creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to exempt goods and services provided by youth athletic facilities from sales and use tax to ensure these vital community resources remain accessible and affordable for families, promote healthy lifestyles, and strengthen local economies.</p>
