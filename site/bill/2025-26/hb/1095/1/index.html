<li>
<p>The law enforcement profession is challenging both physically and mentally, and coupled with the coronavirus pandemic and other significant events that have occurred in recent years that have rapidly changed and shifted community expectations of police, attraction and retention of law enforcement officers has become increasingly difficult. The United States department of justice issued a report in October 2023, with strategies aimed at helping law enforcement agencies increase the number of law enforcement officers. The department of justice report cited a 2023 report from the police executive research forum that showed that police agencies are facing a historic crisis in hiring and retaining law enforcement staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the need for attracting and retaining additional law enforcement officers in Washington. To address this need, the legislature intends to authorize counties and cities to impose a sales and use tax as a credit against the state sales and use tax to provide funding for attracting and retaining law enforcement officers throughout the state.</p>
