## Section 1
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Affixed" means that the manufactured home is installed in accordance with the installation standards in state law.

2. "Department" means the department of licensing.

3. "Eliminating the title" means to cancel an existing certificate of title issued by this state or a foreign jurisdiction or to waive the certificate of title required in chapter 46.12 RCW and recording the appropriate documents in the county real property records pursuant to this chapter.

11. "Title" or "titled" means a certificate of title issued pursuant to chapter 46.12 RCW.

## Section 2
1. When a manufactured home is sold or transferred on or after March 1, 1990, and when all ownership in the manufactured home is transferred through the sale or other transfer of the manufactured home to new owners, the manufactured home shall be real property when the new owners eliminate the title pursuant to this chapter. The manufactured home shall not be real property in any form, including fixture law, unless the title is eliminated under this chapter. Where any person who owned a used manufactured home on March 1, 1990, continues to own the manufactured home on or after March 1, 1990, the interests and rights of owners, secured parties, lienholders, and others in the manufactured home shall be based on the law prior to March 1, 1990, except where the owner voluntarily eliminates the title to the manufactured home by complying with this chapter. If the title to the manufactured home is eliminated under this chapter, the manufactured home shall be considered real property . If the title to the manufactured home has not been eliminated under this chapter, ownership shall be based on chapter 46.12 RCW.

2. For purposes of perfecting and realizing upon security interests, manufactured homes shall always be treated as follows: (a) If the title has not been eliminated under this chapter, security interests in the manufactured home shall be perfected only under chapter 62A.9A RCW in the case of a manufactured home held as inventory by a manufacturer or dealer or chapter 46.12 RCW in all other cases, and the lien shall be treated as securing personal property for purposes of realizing upon the security interest; or (b) if the title has been eliminated under this chapter, a separate security interest in the manufactured home shall not exist, and the manufactured home shall only be secured as part of the real property through a mortgage, deed of trust, lease, or real estate contract.

## Section 3
1. The department shall approve the application for elimination of the title when all requirements listed in RCW 65.20.040 have been satisfied and the registered and legal owners of the manufactured home have consented to the elimination of the title. After approval, the department shall have the approved application recorded in the county or counties in which the land is located and on which the manufactured home is affixed.

2. The county auditor shall record the approved application, and any other form prescribed by the department, in the county real property records. The manufactured home shall then be treated as real property . Removal of the manufactured home from the land is prohibited unless the procedures set forth in RCW 65.20.070 are complied with.

3. The department shall cancel the title after verification that the county auditor has recorded the appropriate documents, and the department shall maintain a record of each manufactured home title eliminated under this chapter by vehicle identification number. The title is deemed eliminated on the date the appropriate documents are recorded by the county auditor.

## Section 4
It is the responsibility of the owner, secured parties, and others to take action as necessary to protect their respective interests in conjunction with the elimination of the title or reissuance of a previously eliminated title.

A manufactured home whose title has been eliminated shall be conveyed by deed, lease, or real estate contract and shall only be transferred together with the interest in the land to which it is affixed, unless procedures described in RCW 65.20.070 are completed.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a secured party to consent to the elimination of the title of a manufactured home, or to retitling a manufactured home under RCW 65.20.070. The obligation of the secured party to consent is governed solely by the agreement between the secured party and the owner of the manufactured home. Absent any express written contractual obligation, a secured party may withhold consent in the secured party's sole discretion. In addition, the homeowner shall comply with all reasonable requirements imposed by a secured party for obtaining consent, and a secured party may charge a reasonable fee for processing a request for consent.

## Section 5

1. Where a title is to be issued or the home has been destroyed:

    a. The owner shall apply to the department for a title pursuant to chapter 46.12 RCW. In addition the owner shall provide:

The title is deemed effective on the date the appropriate documents are recorded with the county auditor.

2. Where the manufactured home is to be moved to a new location but again will be affixed to land owned by the homeowner a new title need not be issued, but the following procedures must be complied with:

    a. The owner shall apply to the department for a transfer in location of the manufactured home and if a new owner, a transfer in ownership by filing an application pursuant to RCW 65.20.040. In addition the owner shall include:
