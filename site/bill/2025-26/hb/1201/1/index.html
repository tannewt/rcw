<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that natural disasters and extreme weather events, including wildfire, flooding, earthquakes, extreme heat, and extreme cold present severe risks to public health and safety in Washington.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that pets are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather conditions, including risk of heatstroke-related illness and death.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that many families consider their pets to be family members. One of the most significant factors affecting evacuation decisions is pet ownership. Pet owners may refuse evacuation, attempt to reenter evacuated sites to rescue their pets, and experience grief, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder due to separation from their pet during an emergency. In addition, zoonotic disease risks increase when pets are abandoned or left to roam during an evacuation.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that gaps in public preparedness and cosheltering opportunities during a disaster or extreme weather event increase the risk to public health and safety.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that partnerships with nongovernmental organizations support emergency planning and preparedness and may be used to support identification and operation of coshelters.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to provide guidance in increasing public preparedness and identifying shelters that can accommodate pets so that in the event of a disaster or extreme weather event, Washington residents will not have to choose between seeking safety and staying with their pets.</p>
