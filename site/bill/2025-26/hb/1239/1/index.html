<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that reentry readiness reduces recidivism, reducing the harm to individuals, families, and communities. The state of Washington has committed to reducing recidivism and increasing reentry readiness by joining and pledging to support the national reentry 2030 initiative.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that an equitable incentive in the form of earned release time incentivizes behaviors which lead to reentry readiness, while also addressing existing racial inequities in earned time and graduated reentry.</p>
<p>Through the reentry readiness act, the legislature intends to align public policy with the goals of the Washington statewide reentry council and the principles of the Washington way program.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the availability of earned time is the most effective means of incentivizing participation in rehabilitative programming, which is critical for the purposes of increasing public safety and improving reentry outcomes.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to provide those who have served the longest sentences with an extended transition period between total confinement and full independence, to increase reentry readiness.</p>

<p>The term of the sentence of an offender committed to a correctional facility operated by the department may be reduced by earned release time in accordance with procedures that shall be developed and adopted by the correctional agency having jurisdiction in which the offender is confined. The earned release time shall be for good behavior and good performance, as determined by the correctional agency having jurisdiction. The correctional agency may calculate but shall not credit the offender with earned release credits in advance of the offender actually earning the credits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any program established pursuant to this section shall allow an offender to earn earned release time credits for presentence incarceration. If an offender is transferred from a county jail to the department, the administrator of a county jail facility shall certify to the department the amount of time spent in custody at the facility and the number of days of earned release time credits lost or not earned. The department may approve a jail certification from a correctional agency that calculates earned release time based on the actual amount of confinement time served by the offender before sentencing when an erroneous calculation of confinement time served by the offender before sentencing appears on the judgment and sentence. The department must adjust an offender's rate of earned release time listed on the jail certification to be consistent with the rate applicable to offenders in the department's facilities. However, the department is not authorized to adjust the amount of presentence earned release time that the jail has certified as lost or not earned.</p>

<p>A person who is eligible for earned early release as provided in this section and who will be supervised by the department pursuant to RCW 9.94A.501 or 9.94A.5011, shall be transferred to community custody in lieu of earned release time;</p>
<pre><code>b. The department shall, as a part of its program for release to the community in lieu of earned release, require the offender to propose a release plan that includes an approved residence and living arrangement. All offenders with community custody terms eligible for release to community custody in lieu of earned release shall provide an approved residence and living arrangement prior to release to the community;

c. The department may deny transfer to community custody in lieu of earned release time if the department determines an offender's release plan, including proposed residence location and living arrangements, may violate the conditions of the sentence or conditions of supervision, place the offender at risk to violate the conditions of the sentence, place the offender at risk to reoffend, or present a risk to victim safety or community safety. The department's authority under this section is independent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or statutory provision regarding conditions for community custody;

d. If the department is unable to approve the offender's release plan, the department may do one or more of the following:

    i. Transfer an offender to partial confinement in lieu of earned early release for a period not to exceed three months. The three months in partial confinement is in addition to that portion of the offender's term of confinement that may be served in partial confinement as provided in RCW 9.94A.728(1)(e);

    ii. Provide rental vouchers to the offender for a period not to exceed six months if rental assistance will result in an approved release plan.
</code></pre>
<p>A voucher must be provided in conjunction with additional transition support programming or services that enable an offender to participate in services including, but not limited to, substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment, sex offender treatment, educational programming, or employment programming;</p>
<pre><code>e. The department shall maintain a list of housing providers that meets the requirements of RCW 72.09.285. If more than two voucher recipients will be residing per dwelling unit, as defined in RCW 59.18.030, rental vouchers for those recipients may only be paid to a housing provider on the department's list

<p>Pursuant to RCW 9.94A.729, the department of corrections shall recalculate the earned release date for any offender currently serving a term of confinement in a facility or institution either operated by the state or utilized under contract. The earned release date shall be recalculated whether the offender is currently incarcerated or is sentenced after the effective date of this section, and regardless of the offender's date of offense. For offenders whose offense was committed prior to the effective date of this section, the recalculation shall apply to any term of confinement set to be completed on or after July 1, 2025, and shall not extend a term of incarceration beyond that to which an offender is currently subject. This act applies to any term of confinement set to be completed on or after July 1, 2025, regardless of the date of the underlying offense.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department of corrections' recalculations of earned release time pursuant to this act do not create any expectations that the percentage of earned release time will be revised before July 1, 2026, and there is no reason to conclude that the maximum percentage of earned release time is an entitlement or creates any liberty interest. The department of corrections is authorized to take the time reasonably necessary to complete the recalculations of earned release time after the effective date of this section.</p>
