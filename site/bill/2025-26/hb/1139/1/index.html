<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the unlawful possession of firearms by individuals with a history of violent criminal behavior presents a significant threat to public safety. Classifying certain instances of unlawful possession of firearms as violent offenses, adjusting sentencing levels, and mandating jail booking for violations seeks to reduce recidivism, deters unlawful firearm possession, and enhances penalties for such offenses.</p>
