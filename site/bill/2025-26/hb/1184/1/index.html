<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washington's nonprofit organizations improve the lives of thousands of Washingtonians and are a part of the state's economy.  Nonprofit organizations serve communities in a variety of ways, such as supporting veterans, stewarding the environment, supporting performing arts and education, fostering and supporting families, promoting economic development, and much more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small businesses also are a significant part of the state's economy and are an important part of communities across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that due to the nature and structure of smaller nonprofits and small businesses, these entities and their ability to continue to meet their communities' needs are being jeopardized by the state overtime rules for exempt employees. When fully implemented in 2028, the minimum salary to be classified as a salaried exempt employee will be two and a half times the statewide minimum wage for a 40-hour week, which is estimated to be approximately $93,000 a year and the highest salary threshold in the nation. Therefore, the legislature is creating a narrow exemption from overtime provisions to allow more flexibility to these entities and their salaried employees.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
