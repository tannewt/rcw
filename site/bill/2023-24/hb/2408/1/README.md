## Section 1
(1) Establishing the state designated 988 contact hubs and enhancing the crisis response system will require collaborative work between the department and the authority within their respective roles. The department shall have primary responsibility for establishing and designating the designated 988 contact hubs. The authority shall have primary responsibility for developing and implementing the crisis response system and services to support the work of the designated 988 contact hubs. In any instance in which one agency is identified as the lead, the expectation is that agency will be communicating and collaborating with the other to ensure seamless, continuous, and effective service delivery within the statewide crisis response system.
