## Section 1
With all correspondence and materials related to evaluation for and provision of special education services, a school district must provide the parent of a student who is or may be eligible for special education services a description of the services available through the office of the education ombuds and the contact information for the office of the education ombuds.

## Section 2
For each student whose individualized education program includes provision of a related or supplementary special education service that is quantifiable, such as hours, minutes, or units, a school district must provide a monthly report, in writing, to the parent of the student that indicates the quantity of each service delivered to the student and the method in which the service was delivered. Identification of the delivery method includes whether the services were delivered in-person or virtually, whether the services were delivered one-on-one or in a group, and whether the services were delivered at the student's school or at another location. The report must be made available within five business days of a parent's request.

## Section 3
Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, each educational service district shall contract for speech language pathologists, audiologists, psychologists, physical therapists, orientation and mobility specialists, occupational therapists, and behavior analysts for the purpose of providing services to local students eligible for special education services.

## Section 4
1. The school district has the burden of proof and the burden of production whenever it is a party to a due process hearing regarding the identification of, evaluation of, reevaluation of, classification of, educational placement of, disciplinary action of, or provision of a free appropriate public education to a student with a disability.

2. In a due process hearing, evidence showing that a student has not failed or been retained in a course or grade, and is advancing from grade to grade, does not create the presumption that the school has provided the student with a free appropriate public education as required by the federal individuals with disabilities education act, Title 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et seq.

3. In a due process hearing related to the lack of parent participation in the adoption of an individualized education program due to an interpreter-related issue, the superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent's designee may order the individualized education program team to reconvene with a qualified interpreter as defined in RCW 28A.183.010, so that the parent can fully participate in any adoption of an individualized education program.
