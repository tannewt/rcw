<ol>
<li>

Identification of the delivery method includes whether the services were delivered in-person or virtually, whether the services were delivered one-on-one or in a group, and whether the services were delivered at the student's school or at another location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the quantity of a service delivered to the student in the prior quarter is less than the quarterly quantity of that service required under the student's individualized education program, the report must include a plan to provide the student with additional services in the following quarter.</p>

</li>
<li>

Sec. 1400 et seq.</p>
</li>
