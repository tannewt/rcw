</li>
<li>
<p>In a specific location where an existing thermal energy company has deployed or is developing a thermal energy network, the commission may opt to not provide priority to the gas company for that location.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>When submitting a thermal energy network pilot project to the commission for review, a gas or electrical company must include specific metrics that the company proposes to use to evaluate the pilot project. These metrics are intended to help inform the commission's rule making and rate making and specifically to help inform any future standardized metrics that the commission may adopt for thermal energy network pilot projects.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department of commerce must provide grant funding to any gas company developing a thermal energy network pilot project in accordance with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant funding from the appropriation authorized in this section for thermal energy network pilot projects is only available for gas companies as defined in RCW 80.04.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gas company may receive grant funding from the department of commerce to offset the costs necessary to build and operate the project. The grant amount for a pilot project may not exceed the difference between the gas company's lowest reasonable cost resources under its current business practices and the costs of building and operating the thermal energy network pilot project. The utilities and transportation commission must determine this cost difference and provide the dollar amount to the department of commerce for the purposes of making the grant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When determining whether to award a grant and the grant amount for a thermal energy network pilot project, the department of commerce must consider the information submitted by the gas company in compliance with section 3 (3) and (4) of this act and any finding or conclusions of the utilities and transportation commission regarding the pilot project. The department of commerce may also allocate available funds to prioritize projects based on their cost-effectiveness and geographic diversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each gas company receiving a grant from the department of commerce for a thermal energy network pilot project must coordinate with other grant awardees, the utilities and transportation commission, the department of commerce, and consultants with expertise on successful thermal energy networks to ensure that the pilot projects are diverse and designed to inform the utilities and transportation commission's decisions in the proceeding on the various ownership, market, and rate structures for thermal energy networks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prior to deploying a thermal energy network pilot project, an investor-owned gas company must issue a request for proposals for a thermal energy network pilot project. When reviewing the proposals, the investor-owned gas company must compare the cost of deployment of a proposed thermal energy network pilot project to the lowest reasonable cost alternative resource for heating services under the gas company's current business practices. This cost comparison must be shared with the commission and considered in calculating grant award amounts as determined pursuant to section 4(4) of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An investor-owned gas company may petition the commission to use an alternative process from the process described in subsection (1) of this section to estimate the cost to deploy a thermal energy network pilot project. The commission must review such a petition and then accept, deny, or accept with modifications such an alternative process.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In any multiyear rate plan proposed by a natural gas company or combination utility, the company may propose a merger into a single rate base of its regulated gas operations with its operation of a thermal energy network. The commission may approve the merger of gas and thermal energy rate bases if the commission finds that such a merger is in the public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a natural gas company or combination utility that has merged gas and thermal energy rate bases, the natural gas company or combination utility must monetize benefits received from any applicable federal and state tax and other incentives for the benefit of customers. These benefits must be separately accounted for and amortized on a schedule designed to mitigate the rate impacts to customers after the rate bases are combined. These credits may not be used for any other purpose, unless directed by the commission.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<p>The joint committee shall conduct an evaluation of the implementation of the thermal energy network pilot project program as outlined in this act and report to the appropriate committees of the legislature on the results of the evaluation no later than three years after the effective date of this section. The report must include an evaluation of how all pilot projects, including those that have been deployed and those that are in the process of deployment, address the considerations outlined in sections 3 and 4 of this act.</p>
