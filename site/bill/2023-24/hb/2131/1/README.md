Each gas company receiving a grant from the department of commerce for a nonemitting thermal energy network pilot project must coordinate with other grant awardees, the utilities and transportation commission, the department of commerce, and consultants with expertise on successful thermal energy networks to ensure that the pilot projects are diverse and designed to inform the utilities and transportation commission's decisions in the proceeding on the various ownership, market, and rate structures for nonemitting thermal energy networks.

## Section 5
Each investor-owned gas company must include a solicitation for nonemitting thermal energy network pilot projects in requests for proposals for energy resources. If the investor-owned gas company determines that it can deploy a pilot project at the lowest reasonable cost instead of deploying a pilot project through a heat purchase agreement or energy services agreement, the company may pursue a nonemitting thermal energy network pilot project in accordance with sections 2 and 3 of this act.

## Section 6
Every gas company, electrical company, wastewater company, or water company, engaged in the sale and distribution of gas, electricity or water or the provision of wastewater company services, shall, upon reasonable notice, furnish to all persons and corporations who may apply therefor and be reasonably entitled thereto, suitable facilities for furnishing and furnish all available gas, electricity, wastewater company services, and water as demanded, except that : (1) A water company may not furnish water contrary to the provisions of water system plans approved under chapter 43.20 or 70A.100 RCW ; (2) wastewater companies may not provide services contrary to the approved general sewer plan; and (3) a gas company's obligation to serve may be met by providing thermal energy through a nonemitting thermal energy network.

## Section 7
1. In any multiyear rate plan proposed by a natural gas company or combination utility, the company may propose a merger into a single rate base of its regulated gas operations with its operation of a nonemitting thermal energy network. The commission may approve the merger of gas and thermal energy rate bases if the commission finds that such a merger is in the public interest. In approving a merger of a gas and thermal energy rate base, the commission must avoid commercial and residential rate classes subsidizing industrial rate classes.

2. For a natural gas company or combination utility that has merged gas and thermal energy rate bases, the natural gas company or combination utility must monetize benefits received from any applicable federal and state tax and other incentives for the benefit of customers. These benefits must be separately accounted for and amortized on a schedule designed to mitigate the rate impacts to customers after the rate bases are combined. These credits may not be used for any other purpose, unless directed by the commission.

## Section 8
The joint committee shall conduct an evaluation of the implementation of the nonemitting thermal energy network pilot project program as outlined in this act and report to the appropriate committees of the legislature on the results of the evaluation no later than three years after the effective date of this section. The report must include an evaluation of how all pilot projects, including those that have been deployed and those that are in the process of deployment, address the considerations outlined in sections 3 and 4 of this act.

## Section 9
A public utility district formed under this title may own, operate, or manage any nonemitting thermal energy network, as defined in RCW 80.04.010, within this state. If a public utility district intends to deploy a nonemitting thermal energy network, the public utility district must submit the project for review and approval to its governing body.

## Section 10
A municipal electric utility formed under this title may own, operate, or manage any nonemitting thermal energy network, as defined in RCW 80.04.010, within this state. If a municipal electric utility intends to deploy a nonemitting thermal energy network, the utility must submit the project for review and approval to its governing body.
