[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1261.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, for nongrandfathered health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2024, that include coverage of supplemental breast examinations and diagnostic breast examinations, health carriers may not impose cost sharing for such examinations.

2. For a health plan that provides coverage of supplemental breast examinations and diagnostic breast examinations and is offered as a qualifying health plan for a health savings account, the health carrier shall establish the plan's cost sharing for the coverage of the services described in this section at the minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax exempt contributions from their health savings account under internal revenue service laws and regulations.

3. For purposes of this section:

    a. "Diagnostic breast examination" means a medically necessary and appropriate examination of the breast, including an examination using diagnostic mammography, breast magnetic resonance imaging, or breast ultrasound, that is used to evaluate an abnormality:

        i. Seen or suspected from a screening examination for breast cancer; or

        ii. Detected by another means of examination.

    b. "Supplemental breast examination" means a medically necessary and appropriate examination of the breast, including an examination using breast magnetic resonance imaging or breast ultrasound, that is: (i) Used to screen for breast cancer when there is no abnormality seen or suspected; and

        ii. Based on personal or family medical history, or additional factors that may increase the individual's risk of breast cancer.
