<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that students receiving special education services are entitled, under both federal and state law, to a free appropriate public education that enables their full participation.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that a cap or enrollment limit on the number of students receiving special education services that generate state special education funding is not consistent with the state's duty to provide a free appropriate public education. An enrollment limit that fails to provide equity for all students with disabilities affects all students in public schools.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that school districts pay for special education services with local funding, creating an inequitable situation for school districts and students. The legislature supports a system of funding that does not require school districts to generate local funding to meet their obligation to provide special education services.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that along with reliable and sufficient state funding, receiving special education services in the least restrictive environment possible is crucial to student success. A recent large-scale study found that students who spend at least 80 percent of their day in a general education setting improved their reading scores by 24 points and math scores by 18 points compared to peers with similar disabilities in less inclusive settings.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that the documented prevalence of disabilities amongst children, particularly amongst vulnerable populations and communities with disparately poor health outcomes and access to health services, indicates that the state should improve access to evaluations for disabilities.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that special education is fully part of the state's statutory program of basic education that is deemed by the legislature to implement Article IX, section 1 of the state Constitution.</p>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to fully fund special education services by removing the 13.5 percent cap, eliminating the cap entirely in the 2027-28 school year, and increasing the tiered special education multipliers for elementary and secondary students, thereby giving every school district a funding increase.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to require a comprehensive study of funding and services for students with disabilities completed prior to the 2025 legislative session to understand if the state is appropriately identifying students with disabilities, identify funding and service gaps, and ensure that funding provided by the state to school districts, charter schools, and other entities for services are being used to meet the needs of students with disabilities.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall submit to each regular session of the legislature during an odd-numbered year a programmed budget request for special education programs for students with disabilities. Funding for programs operated by local school districts shall be on an excess cost basis from appropriations provided by the legislature for special education programs for students with disabilities and shall take account of state funds accruing through RCW 28A.150.260 (4)(a), (5), (6), and (8) and 28A.150.415.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The excess cost allocation to school districts shall be based on the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A district's annual average headcount enrollment of students ages three and four and those five year olds not yet enrolled in kindergarten who are eligible for and receiving special education, multiplied by the district's base allocation per full-time equivalent student, multiplied by 1.15;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Subject to the limitation in (b)(ii) of this subsection (2), a district's annual average enrollment of resident students who are eligible for and receiving special education, excluding students ages three and four and those five year olds not yet enrolled in kindergarten, multiplied by the district's base allocation per full-time equivalent student, multiplied by the special education cost multiplier rate of:</li>

<p>(I) In the 2023-24 school year, 1.035;</p>
<p>(II) In the 2024-25 school year, 1.04;</p>
<p>(III) In the 2025-26 school year, 1.043;</p>
<p>(IV) Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, 1.059; or</p>
<p>(B) For students eligible for and receiving special education and reported to be in the general education setting for less than 80 percent of the school day:</p>
<p>(I) In the 2023-24 school year, 1.02;</p>
<p>(II) In the 2024-25 school year, 1.025;</p>
<p>(III) In the 2025-26 school year, 1.028;</p>
<p>(IV) Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, 1.043.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. Through the 2026-27 school year, if the enrollment percent exceeds the funded enrollment limit, the excess cost allocation calculated under (b)(i) of this subsection must be adjusted by multiplying the allocation by the funded enrollment limit divided by the enrollment percent.

<p>To the extent necessary, funds shall be made available for safety net awards for districts with demonstrated needs for special education funding beyond the amounts provided through the special education funding formula under RCW 28A.150.390.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the federal safety net awards based on the federal eligibility threshold exceed the federal appropriation in any fiscal year, then the superintendent shall expend all available federal discretionary funds necessary to meet this need.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safety net funds shall be awarded by the state safety net oversight committee subject to the following conditions and limitations:</p>

<li>
<p>The committee shall award additional funds for districts that can convincingly demonstrate that all legitimate expenditures for special education exceed all available revenues from state funding formulas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the determination of need, the committee shall consider additional available revenues from federal sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences in program costs attributable to district philosophy, service delivery choice, or accounting practices are not a legitimate basis for safety net awards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the determination of need, the committee shall require that districts demonstrate that they are maximizing their eligibility for all state revenues related to services for students eligible for special education and all federal revenues from federal impact aid, medicaid, and the individuals with disabilities education act-Part B and appropriate special projects. Awards associated with (e) and (f) of this subsection shall not exceed the total of a district's specific determination of need.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Using criteria developed by the committee, the committee shall then consider extraordinary costs associated with communities that draw a larger number of families with children in need of special education services, which may include consideration of proximity to group homes, military bases, and regional hospitals. Safety net awards under this subsection (2)(f) shall be adjusted to reflect amounts awarded under (e) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committee shall then consider the extraordinary high cost needs of one or more individual students eligible for and receiving special education served in residential schools as defined in RCW 28A.190.005, programs for juveniles under the department of corrections, and programs for juveniles operated by city and county jails to the extent they are providing a secondary program of education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum allowable indirect cost for calculating safety net eligibility may not exceed the federal restricted indirect cost rate for the district plus one percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safety net awards shall be adjusted based on the percent of potential medicaid eligible students billed as calculated by the superintendent of public instruction in accordance with chapter 318, Laws of 1999.</p>
