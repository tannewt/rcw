# HB 1904 - Hybrid electric ferries

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1904.pdf)

## Section 1
The Washington state ferries has been reported as the state agency with the highest amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The greenhouse gas reduction strategy is to transition the ferry system to hybrid electric ferries. The climate commitment act includes reference to revenues being used to pay for electric ferries. The revenues from the climate commitment act in 2023 far exceeded the amounts forecasted. In addition, the costs to transition Washington's ferry fleet to hybrid electric power are projected to cost hundreds of millions more per vessel and associated hookups than using a traditional internal combustion engine. The legislature finds that transition to electrification of the public ferry fleets is a priority for the health and well-being of the people and sealife living in Washington and Washington waters. Therefore, the legislature finds that all costs associated with building hybrid electric ferries and their associated infrastructure must be paid for using climate commitment act revenues.

## Section 2
1. The carbon emissions reduction account is created in the state treasury. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account are intended to affect reductions in transportation sector carbon emissions through a variety of carbon reducing investments. These can include, but are not limited to: Transportation alternatives to single occupancy passenger vehicles; reductions in single occupancy passenger vehicle miles traveled; reductions in per mile emissions in vehicles, including through the funding of alternative fuel infrastructure and incentive programs; and emission reduction programs for freight transportation, including motor vehicles and rail, as well as for ferries and other maritime and port activities. Expenditures from the account may only be made for transportation carbon emission reducing purposes and may not be made for highway purposes authorized under the 18th Amendment of the Washington state Constitution, other than specified in this section, and shall be made in accordance with subsection (2) of this section. It is the legislature's intent that expenditures from the account used to reduce carbon emissions be made with the goal of achieving equity for communities that historically have been omitted or adversely impacted by past transportation policies and practices.

2. Appropriations in an omnibus transportation appropriations act from the carbon emissions reduction account shall be made exclusively to fund the following activities:

    a. Active transportation;

    b. Transit programs and projects;

    c. Alternative fuel and electrification;

    d. All aspects of ferry vessel construction and supporting electrification infrastructure; and

    e. Rail.

## Section 3
(1)(a) The climate investment account is created in the state treasury. Except as otherwise provided in chapter 316, Laws of 2021, all receipts from the auction of allowances authorized in this chapter must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.

## Section 4
1. The climate commitment account is created in the state treasury. The account must receive moneys distributed to the account from the climate investment account created in RCW 70A.65.250.
