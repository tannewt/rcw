## Section 1
1. The exchange, in consultation with the commissioner, the authority, an independent actuary, and other stakeholders, must establish up to three standardized health plans for each of the bronze, silver, and gold levels. Beginning in 2027, the exchange may establish additional standardized plans at other actuarial value levels, including catastrophic and platinum.

    a. The standardized health plans must be designed to reduce deductibles, make more services available before the deductible, provide predictable cost sharing, maximize subsidies, limit adverse premium impacts, reduce barriers to maintaining and improving health, and encourage choice based on value, while limiting increases in health plan premium rates.

    b. The exchange may update the standardized health plans annually.

    c. The exchange must provide a notice and public comment period before finalizing each year's standardized health plans.

    d. The exchange must provide written notice of the standardized health plans to licensed health carriers by January 31st before the year in which the health plans are to be offered on the exchange. The exchange may make modifications to the standardized plans after January 31st to comply with changes to state or federal law or regulations.
