<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that certain people in the care of the department of children, youth, and families, including youth experiencing foster care, may be eligible for federal supplemental security income or other public benefits, including instances where a parent is deceased or the youth is living with a physical or mental disability. The legislature finds that people in the care of the department represent an especially vulnerable population in need of supportive resources. The legislature finds that according to a 2022 study by the department of social and health services, 17 percent of youth leaving Washington's foster care system experience homelessness within a year of exiting. The legislature further finds that 33 percent of youth in foster care experience homelessness by age 21. The legislature recognizes that the state of Washington has utilized federal supplemental security income benefits to offset the cost of care, including in the foster care system. The legislature recognizes that utilization of these funds to support youth and young adults with their transition to independence would meet a pressing need by preventing and disrupting youth and young adult homelessness. Therefore, the legislature resolves to end the practice of diverting federal supplemental security income and other public benefits from people in the care of the department of children, youth, and families and to form a work group to recommend and implement a process to provide financial education and access to public benefits.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
