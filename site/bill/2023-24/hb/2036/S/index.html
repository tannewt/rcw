<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In recognizing the importance of protecting all workers from exploitation, the legislature passed Engrossed House Bill 1756 (2019), directing the department of labor and industries to convene an advisory committee to develop recommendations aimed at increasing safety and security of entertainers in adult entertainment establishments. Members of the advisory committee represented an array of interests and expertise, and most importantly, the committee included the voices of eight entertainers, all of whom have worked in adult entertainment establishments for more than five years. The final report and recommendations of the advisory committee are based on both the voices and experiences from impacted workers and business owners, as well as the available research focused on this industry. By elevating the voices of entertainers, the report recognizes the complexity of real-life experiences in an industry that has been historically stigmatized. The committee acknowledged that solutions must strike an achievable balance, maximizing worker protections while allowing businesses to remain profitable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes critical reforms recommended by the advisory committee. For that reason, the legislature hereby intends to establish the following workplace protections:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Requiring training for all employees, including employees who are not entertainers, in order to prevent harassment, discrimination, and assault;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing minimum security staffing requirements; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulating leasing fees charged to entertainers, including eliminating back rent and capping certain fees.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also intends to expand existing requirements, including those pertaining to panic buttons and blocklists, in an effort to improve compliance and enforcement. And importantly, safeguarding worker safety will be impossible if workers continue to fear criminal prosecution for otherwise legal artistic performances that do not involve sexual contact with patrons. Therefore, the legislature intends to clarify the boundaries for local enforcement actions in order to facilitate open communication between entertainers, establishments, local law enforcement, the liquor and cannabis board, and the department of labor and industries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the legislature also recognizes that the advisory committee identified several safety and security concerns associated with the existing prohibition against holding a liquor license in establishments where entertainers perform unclothed or expose certain parts of their body, which is based on regulations promulgated by the liquor and cannabis board. Of those concerns, the advisory committee highlighted the inability of adult entertainment establishments to adequately regulate the behaviors of their patrons. Alcohol consumption by customers frequently occurs off-site, or from an alternative source, and it cannot be monitored or controlled by staff and entertainers of adult entertainment establishments. Consistent with various other types of venues in Washington, adult entertainment establishments offer &quot;in and out&quot; privileges for their patrons, meaning that customers are free to leave and reenter the establishment once a cover charge for that day has been paid. Entertainers report it is a common practice for customers to leave an establishment to seek out alcohol service and then return later. According to the findings of a 2017 report from the University of Minnesota addressing the topic of alcohol sales in adult entertainment establishments, even in nonalcohol serving establishments, it is very common for customers to arrive already intoxicated, and prohibitions on alcohol do not prevent entertainers from coming into contact with intoxicated persons. Additionally, the lack of alcohol sales inadvertently places entertainers as the main, and often only, source of revenue for the establishments. The legislature finds this limits the entertainers' ability to deny services to customers who may pose a risk, thereby forcing them into hazardous working conditions and difficult economic choices. Therefore, the advisory committee recommended a change to agency rules to allow for alcohol service in adult entertainment establishments. While changes to liquor license regulations may be helpful for improving workplace safety in these establishments, the legislature recognizes that these changes can be effected through agency rule making following the implementation of the reforms provided herein.</p>
