<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that policies concerning sex-based violence and harassment have evolved into a survivor-focused, victim-centered approach on a state level. While college campuses have been working in this area, this approach has not been fully realized on college campuses, and sex-based violence and harassment remain a major barrier for students working to achieve their educational goals. Postsecondary students lack adequate protections against sex-based violence and harassment as well as avenues for justice. Survivors at postsecondary institutions should be entitled to certain protections, resources, and accommodations to help them navigate the aftermath of traumatic sex-based violence and harassment.</p>
<p>The legislature has previously found in section 1, chapter 335, Laws of 2020 that nondisclosure agreements, which prevent an institution from disclosing that an employee has committed sexual misconduct, create a high potential for students in jeopardy of being victimized. Therefore, the legislature finds such nondisclosure agreements between an employee and institution, pursuant to which the institution agrees not to disclose findings of sexual misconduct supported by a preponderance of evidence or not to complete an investigation, are against public policy and should not be entered into by any Washington postsecondary educational institution and should not be enforced by Washington courts.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that the same public policy to protect students, faculty, and staff from serial sexual misconduct should extend to nondisclosure agreements proposed by a postsecondary educational institution to a student who has filed a Title IX complaint, other civil action, or criminal complaint arising from the alleged sexual misconduct of a student or employee of the institution.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In addition to all other rights provided in law, a student at an institution of higher education in Washington who is a survivor of sex-based violence and harassment has the right to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Engage with staff who have been trained in trauma-informed care throughout the entirety of the disclosing process. Institutional staff who are trained in trauma-informed care must be listed on each institution of higher education's website in an easily accessible place. Title IX staff at each institution of higher education who may interact with a survivor of sex-based violence and harassment must receive at least three hours of training on relationship violence, abuse dynamics, impacts of trauma on the body, and other forms of violence. The institution of higher education shall provide the training in accordance with section 4 of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quick and timely institutional investigation process not to exceed six months from the date an investigation is initiated, unless extenuating circumstances exist. Students must be kept informed on the status of the investigation throughout the entirety of the process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-person or live electronic education on reporting sex-based violence and harassment at institutions of higher education and available resources, including confidential advocates, for students who have experienced sex-based violence and harassment on campus. Education must be provided at the beginning of each academic term;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protection from legal retaliation for reporting sex-based violence and harassment on campus, including strategic lawsuit against public participation lawsuits advanced by a person being accused of sex-based violence and harassment. Institutions of higher education must have a policy against legal retaliation for reporting sex-based violence and harassment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental health or counseling services, on campus or off-site, regardless of whether the student chooses to make a formal report through Title IX or to law enforcement. The institution of higher education shall make a good faith effort to ensure students have access to no less than six visits with the same mental health provider either in person or electronically via telehealth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to confidential support services, which may include peer advocates, confidential advocates, and gender-based violence support groups. Beginning with the 2025-26 academic year, institutions of higher education must hire and train confidential advocates. A confidential advocate trained in trauma-informed care must be available within two business days of a report being made. Beginning with the 2027-28 academic year, the state college, state universities, and regional universities that serve 8,000 or more students shall provide students on campus and within a one-mile radius of campus 24/7 transportation access to sexual assault nurse examiners and forensic medical services on campus or at a medical facility. Survivors must have the option to be accompanied by a confidential advocate or peer advocate trained in trauma-informed care. Peer advocates must be trained in trauma-informed care and have 40 hours of basic advocacy training provided by the institution. Confidential advocates may include personnel from the institution or from a partnership with a local victim's advocacy organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Academic adjustments to prevent academic harm. Title IX staff or a confidential advocate must be available to a survivor and that survivor's instructors or supervisors to assist with the adjustment request. Survivors must be permitted to participate in academic activities through alternate means where feasible. Once an adjustment is requested under this subsection, the confidential advocate shall collaborate with instructors or supervisors to identify the means of adjustment that best preserves the benefits of the academic activity for the survivor. Adjustments must be available to sexual assault survivors regardless of whether the student requesting adjustments has made a formal report through Title IX. Confidential advocates may not disclose any information regarding the survivor's experience to faculty in the course of negotiating academic adjustments under this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have court-issued no-contact and restraining orders honored and reported to university police and security services by a trained employee such as a confidential advocate when they become aware of such an order; and</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Be made aware by an employee if the employee is a Title IX mandatory reporter and to whom the employee reports.</li>
