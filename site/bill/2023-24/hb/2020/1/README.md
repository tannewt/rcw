# HB 2020 - Creating a state administered public infrastructure assistance program within the emergency management division.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2020.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the state is experiencing disasters with greater frequency and longer duration, causing damage to public infrastructure that is beyond the capacity of local government and tribal government response. Furthermore, these impacts to public infrastructure result in disruption of essential services critical to the safety and well-being of Washingtonians. Therefore, the legislature intends to provide supplementary state assistance to county and federally recognized tribal governments for the cost of disaster-related response to address public infrastructure damage when authorized under governor emergency proclamation.
