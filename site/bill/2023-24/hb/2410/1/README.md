# HB 2410 - Jet fuel tax preferences

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2410.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature intends to support the development of the alternative jet fuels industry in Washington by expanding existing tax preferences to encourage businesses to locate in distressed areas of the state. The legislature intends for the incentives to be focused on the beginning of commercial production levels when they provide the most productive benefits, while providing opportunities for workforce development and long-term employment opportunities in distressed areas.

## Section 2
1. Upon every person engaging within the state in the business of manufacturing alternative jet fuel; as to such persons, the amount of the tax with respect to such business is, in the case of manufacturers, equal to the value of the product manufactured, or in the case of processors for hire, equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate of 0.275 percent.

2. Upon every person engaging in making sales, at retail or wholesale, of manufactured alternative jet fuel; as to such persons, the amount of the tax with respect to such business is equal to the gross proceeds of sales of the alternative jet fuel, multiplied by the rate of 0.275 percent.

3. For the purposes of this section, "alternative jet fuel" means a fuel that can be blended and used with conventional petroleum jet fuels without the need to modify aircraft engines and existing fuel distribution infrastructure and that has lower greenhouse gas emissions based on a full life-cycle analysis when compared to conventional petroleum jet fuel for which it is capable as serving as a substitute, as certified by the department of ecology using the methods for determining the carbon intensity of fuels under chapter 70A.535 RCW. "Alternative jet fuel" includes jet fuels derived from coprocessed feedstocks at a conventional petroleum refinery as certified by the department of ecology using the methods for determining the carbon intensity of fuels under chapter 70A.535 RCW.

4. A person reporting under the tax rate provided in this section must file a complete annual tax performance report with the department under RCW 82.32.534.

5. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the tax rate under subsections (1) and (2) of this section takes effect on the first day of the first calendar quarter following the month in which the department receives notice from the department of ecology that there are one or more facilities operating in this state with a cumulative production capacity of at least 20,000,000 gallons of alternative jet fuel each year, as required in RCW 70A.535.150.

    b. For a business that produces alternative jet fuel and is located in a distressed area in this state, the tax rate under subsections (1) and (2) of this section takes effect on the first day of the first calendar quarter following the month in which the department receives notice from the department of ecology, as required in RCW 70A.535.150, that the particular facility has a facility-specific production capacity of at least 500,000 gallons of alternative jet fuel each year.

    c. The tax rate expires nine calendar years after the close of the calendar year in which the department receives notice from the department of ecology that there are one or more facilities operating in this state with a cumulative production capacity of at least 20,000,000 gallons of alternative jet fuel each year, as required in RCW 70A.535.150.

6. For purposes of this section, "distressed area" and "qualifying county" have the same meanings as in RCW 82.04.436.

    g. A credit under this section may not be claimed by a business under (b)(iii) of this subsection (1) until after June 30, 2025, and after the department of ecology has provided notice to the department that it verified that the business is operating a facility with a facility-specific production capacity of at least 500,000 gallons of alternative jet fuel each year.
