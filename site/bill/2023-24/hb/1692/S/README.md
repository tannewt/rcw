# HB 1692 - Student advisory groups

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1692-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that people participating in their government is an essential part of developing public policy. Familiarizing students with their representative government's policy development process increases social responsibility and civic awareness that will benefit them now as students and later as adults while improving our state. The legislature further finds that policymakers can benefit from the input of students presently in our kindergarten through grade 12 school system and those attending a community or technical college, sharing insights and ideas on education and other issues affecting youth in our state. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish student councils, including 49 legislative district student councils each representing one legislative district to ensure proportional and geographical representation, to allow students to learn about and participate in our representative democracy and share policy ideas with their state elected officials.

## Section 2
1. A legislative district student council is established in each legislative district to examine issues important to youth. Legislative district student councils are informal nonpartisan advisory bodies which may examine issues affecting youth and education and make recommendations to legislators on those issues. Each chair of a legislative district student council, selected pursuant to this section, shall coordinate with the legislators from the legislative district which the student member represents to stand up and maintain their district's student council. Each legislative district student council is facilitated by the legislative office or offices of legislators who elect to assist in facilitating the program. Participation in this process is discretionary for each legislator.

2. Consistent with the provisions of this act, the legislative youth advisory council, in consultation with the student representative network created in section 3 of this act, shall develop:

    a. Processes and procedures that may be used to set up legislative district student councils;

    b. An application and selection process that may be used to select student members to serve on the council, including for the position of chair for each legislative district student council;

    c. A model process, program, and duties for legislative district student councils, which must include mechanisms for administration, supervision, and facilitation support to the legislative district student councils; and

    d. Model practices enabling qualifying schools to conduct legislative district student council meetings as extracurricular activities.

3. Each legislative district student council is composed of no more than 11 student members as follows:

    a. One chair, selected for each legislative district student council by the legislative youth advisory council, established under RCW 43.15.095. The legislative youth advisory council shall select the initial chairs no later than October 1, 2023, with the selection of the subsequent chairs being on June 1, 2025, and each June 1st every two years thereafter.

To the extent possible, the Washington state school directors' association shall select up to five student board representatives from each legislative district who attend a public school that serves students in any of grades nine through 12 and are members of the Washington state school directors' association's student representatives network to receive automatic membership to that district's legislative district student council.

        ii. Factors to consider for selection of the members described in this subsection (3)(c) include:

4. To the closest extent feasible, the members of each legislative district student council must attend either a qualifying school that serves students in any of grades nine through 12 or a community or technical college, that is in their council's legislative district. If there are no applicants from a legislative district, qualifying students who attend a qualifying school that serves students in any of grades nine through 12 or a community or technical college located in an adjacent legislative district may be selected for membership.

5. Membership terms are as follows:

    a. Of the chairs initially selected, each chair shall serve two-year terms except that students who are in grade 12 shall serve a one-year term but may serve the full two-year term if they attend a community or technical college within the student council's legislative district in the following year. The term of each subsequent chair shall be two years, but qualifying chairs may be selected for subsequent two-year terms.

    b. Of the members initially selected to serve on a legislative district student council, each member shall serve a two-year term, except that students who are in grade 12 shall serve a one-year term but may serve the full two-year term if they attend a community or technical college within the student council's legislative district in the following year.
