<p>Numbers on the vertical axis of the grid under the column titled &quot;SERIOUSNESS LEVEL&quot; represent the seriousness level of the offense, according to section 2 of this act. Numbers on the horizontal axis of the grid under the column titled &quot;OFFENDER SCORE&quot; represent the offender score as determined by RCW 9.94A.525.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following rules apply to the rows extending from the vertical axis of the sentencing grid:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The row representing seriousness level 18 is reserved for the crime of aggravated murder in the first degree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No offense except for a class A felony may be sentenced according to the rows representing seriousness levels 10 and higher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No offense except for a class A or class B felony may be sentenced according to the rows representing seriousness levels six through nine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numbers in the cells occupying the rows of each seriousness level category represent the minimum and maximum number of months of the standard range sentence for each offender score. The values in each cell are calculated using the following formulas:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For the row representing seriousness level 17: The minimum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 240 months. The minimum standard range sentence is 75 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for each cell. The maximum standard range sentence increases by 104 percent for each additional criminal history score point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the rows representing seriousness levels 14 through 16:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The maximum standard range sentence for a seriousness level 16 offense at an offender score of nine or more is 340 months. For each seriousness level from 14 through 16, the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more is 40 months higher than the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more for each seriousness level directly below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 45 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more. The maximum standard range sentence increases by 110 percent for each additional criminal history score point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum standard range sentence is 75 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for each cell.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the rows representing seriousness levels 10 through 13:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The maximum standard range sentence for a seriousness level 13 offense at an offender score of nine or more is 220 months. For each seriousness level from 10 through 13, the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more is 25 months higher than the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more for each seriousness level directly below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 45 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more. The maximum standard sentence increases by 110 percent for each additional criminal history score point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum standard sentence is 60 percent of the maximum standard sentence for each cell.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the rows representing seriousness levels six through nine:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The maximum standard range sentence for a seriousness level nine offense at an offender score of nine or more is 120 months. For each seriousness level from six through nine, the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more is 15 months higher than the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more for each seriousness level directly below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 27.5 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more. The maximum standard range sentence increases by 115 percent for each additional criminal history score point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum standard sentence is 60 percent of the maximum standard sentence for each cell.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the rows representing seriousness levels one through five:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The maximum standard range sentence for a seriousness level five offense at an offender score of nine or more is 60 months. For each decrease in seriousness level from five to one, the maximum standard sentence for an offender score of nine or more decreases by 10.5 months rounded down to the nearest whole number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 20 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more. The maximum standard range sentence increases by 120 percent for each additional criminal history score point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum standard range sentence is 30 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for each cell.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The numbers in the column titled &quot;AGGRAVATED DEPARTURE CAP&quot; represent the number of months equal to 10 percent of the maximum standard range sentence in each seriousness level, rounded down to the nearest whole number. Exceptional sentences that exceed the maximum standard range sentence plus the number of months signified in this column are presumed to be clearly excessive under RCW 9.94A.585.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A prior conviction is a conviction which exists before the date of sentencing for the offense for which the offender score is being computed.

</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, adjudications of guilt pursuant to Title 13 RCW which are not murder in the first or second degree or class A felony sex offenses may not be included in the offender score.</p>

<p>Class B prior felony convictions other than sex offenses shall not be included in the offender score, if since the last date of release from confinement (including full-time residential treatment) pursuant to a felony conviction, if any, or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender had spent ten consecutive years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, confinement due to a violation of community custody conditions does not qualify as confinement for purposes of calculating time since the last date of release from confinement under this subsection. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, convictions for simple misdemeanor offenses do not qualify as crimes subsequently resulting in a conviction for purposes of this subsection, unless the offender has three or more simple misdemeanor convictions during the 10-year period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (e) of this subsection, class C prior felony convictions other than sex offenses shall not be included in the offender score if, since the last date of release from confinement (including full-time residential treatment) pursuant to a felony conviction, if any, or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender had spent five consecutive years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, confinement due to a violation of community custody conditions does not qualify as confinement for purposes of calculating time since the last date of release from confinement under this subsection. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, convictions for simple misdemeanor offenses do not qualify as crimes subsequently resulting in a conviction for purposes of this subsection, unless the offender has three or more simple misdemeanor convictions during the five-year period.</p>

<p>Except as provided in (e) of this subsection, serious traffic convictions shall not be included in the offender score if, since the last date of release from confinement (including full-time residential treatment) pursuant to a conviction, if any, or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender spent five years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, confinement due to a violation of community custody conditions does not qualify as confinement for purposes of calculating time since the last date of release from confinement under this subsection. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, convictions for simple misdemeanor offenses do not qualify as crimes subsequently resulting in a conviction for purposes of this subsection, unless the offender has three or more simple misdemeanor convictions during the five-year period.</p>

<p>Prior convictions for a repetitive domestic violence offense, as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, shall not be included in the offender score if, since the last date of release from confinement or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender had spent ten consecutive years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, confinement due to a violation of community custody conditions does not qualify as confinement for purposes of calculating time since the last date of release from confinement under this subsection.

<p>This subsection applies to both prior adult convictions and prior juvenile adjudications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out-of-state convictions for offenses shall be classified according to the comparable offense definitions and sentences provided by Washington law. Federal convictions for offenses shall be classified according to the comparable offense definitions and sentences provided by Washington law. Neither out-of-state or federal convictions which would have been presumptively adjudicated in juvenile court under Washington law may be included in the offender score unless they are comparable to murder in the first or second degree or a class A felony sex offense. If there is no clearly comparable offense under Washington law or the offense is one that is usually considered subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction, the offense shall be scored as a class C felony equivalent if it was a felony under the relevant federal statute.</p>

The current sentencing court may presume that such other prior offenses were not the same criminal conduct from sentences imposed on separate dates, or in separate counties or jurisdictions, or in separate complaints, indictments, or informations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of multiple prior convictions for offenses committed before July 1, 1986, for the purpose of computing the offender score, count all convictions or adjudications served concurrently as one offense. Use the conviction for the offense that yields the highest offender score.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this subsection (5), &quot;served concurrently&quot; means that: (i) The latter sentence was imposed with specific reference to the former; (ii) the concurrent relationship of the sentences was judicially imposed; and (iii) the concurrent timing of the sentences was not the result of a probation or parole revocation on the former offense.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) The provisions of this section apply to the standard sentence ranges determined by section 1 of this act, RCW 9.94A.510, or 9.94A.517.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At any time prior to trial or entry of the guilty plea if substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced, the state may give notice that it is seeking a sentence above the standard sentencing range. The notice shall state aggravating circumstances upon which the requested sentence will be based.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any case where an exceptional sentence above the standard range was imposed and where a new sentencing hearing is required, the superior court may impanel a jury to consider any alleged aggravating circumstances listed in RCW 9.94A.535(3), that were relied upon by the superior court in imposing the previous sentence, at the new sentencing hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facts supporting aggravating circumstances shall be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury's verdict on the aggravating factor must be unanimous, and by special interrogatory. If a jury is waived, proof shall be to the court beyond a reasonable doubt, unless the defendant stipulates to the aggravating facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence regarding any facts supporting aggravating circumstances under RCW 9.94A.535(3) (a) through (y) shall be presented to the jury during the trial of the alleged crime, unless the jury has been impaneled solely for resentencing, or unless the state alleges the aggravating circumstances listed in RCW 9.94A.535(3) (e)(iv), (h)(i), (o), or (t). If one of these aggravating circumstances is alleged, the trial court may conduct a separate proceeding if the evidence supporting the aggravating fact is not part of the res geste of the charged crime, if the evidence is not otherwise admissible in trial of the charged crime, and if the court finds that the probative value of the evidence to the aggravated fact is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect on the jury's ability to determine guilt or innocence for the underlying crime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the superior court conducts a separate proceeding to determine the existence of aggravating circumstances listed in RCW 9.94A.535(3) (e)(iv), (h)(i), (o), or (t), the proceeding shall immediately follow the trial on the underlying conviction, if possible. If any person who served on the jury is unable to continue, the court shall substitute an alternate juror.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the jury finds, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, one or more of the facts alleged by the state in support of an aggravated sentence, the court may sentence the offender pursuant to RCW 9.94A.535 to a term of confinement up to the maximum allowed under RCW 9A.20.021 for the underlying conviction if it finds, considering the purposes of this chapter, that the facts found are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence. In imposing a sentence above the standard sentence range for an offense committed on or after August 1, 2028, the court shall consider the threshold at which the sentence is presumed to be clearly excessive as indicated by the standard range sentence plus the maximum number of months in the column titled &quot;aggravated departure cap&quot; in the sentencing grid under section 1 of this act and under RCW 9.94A.585(4).</p>

<li>
<p>A sentence within the standard sentence range, under section 1 of this act, RCW 9.94A.510, or 9.94A.517, for an offense shall not be appealed. For purposes of this section, a sentence imposed on a first-time offender under RCW 9.94A.650 shall also be deemed to be within the standard sentence range for the offense and shall not be appealed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sentence outside the standard sentence range for the offense is subject to appeal by the defendant or the state. The appeal shall be to the court of appeals in accordance with rules adopted by the supreme court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pending review of the sentence, the sentencing court or the court of appeals may order the defendant confined or placed on conditional release, including bond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reverse a sentence which is outside the standard sentence range, the reviewing court must find: (a) Either that the reasons supplied by the sentencing court are not supported by the record which was before the judge or that those reasons do not justify a sentence outside the standard sentence range for that offense; or (b) that the sentence imposed was clearly excessive or clearly too lenient. A sentence imposed for an offense committed on or after August 1, 2028, that exceeds the standard range sentence plus the maximum number of months in the column titled &quot;aggravated departure cap&quot; on the sentencing grid under section 1 of this act is presumed to be clearly excessive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A review under this section shall be made solely upon the record that was before the sentencing court. Written briefs shall not be required and the review and decision shall be made in an expedited manner according to rules adopted by the supreme court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court of appeals shall issue a written opinion in support of its decision whenever the judgment of the sentencing court is reversed and may issue written opinions in any other case where the court believes that a written opinion would provide guidance to sentencing courts and others in implementing this chapter and in developing a common law of sentencing within the state.</p>

<p>The intersection of the column defined by the offender score and the row defined by the offense seriousness score determines the standard sentence range (see section 1 of this act, (Table 1), RCW 9.94A.510, (Table 3), and RCW 9.94A.517, (Table 5)). The additional time for deadly weapon findings or for other adjustments as specified in RCW 9.94A.533 shall be added to the entire standard sentence range. The court may impose any sentence within the range that it deems appropriate. All standard sentence ranges are expressed in terms of total confinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining any sentence other than a sentence above the standard range, the trial court may rely on no more information than is admitted by the plea agreement, or admitted, acknowledged, or proved in a trial or at the time of sentencing, or proven pursuant to RCW 9.94A.537. Where the defendant disputes material facts, the court must either not consider the fact or grant an evidentiary hearing on the point. The facts shall be deemed proved at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence, except as otherwise specified in RCW 9.94A.537. On remand for resentencing following appeal or collateral attack, the parties shall have the opportunity to present and the court to consider all relevant evidence regarding criminal history, including criminal history not previously presented.</p>

<li>
<p>In determining any sentence above the standard sentence range, the court shall follow the procedures set forth in RCW 9.94A.537. Facts that establish the elements of a more serious crime or additional crimes may not be used to go outside the standard sentence range except upon stipulation or when specifically provided for in RCW 9.94A.535(3)(d), (e), (g), and (h).</p>
