1. Numbers on the vertical axis of the grid under the column titled "SERIOUSNESS LEVEL" represent the seriousness level of the offense, according to section 2 of this act. Numbers on the horizontal axis of the grid under the column titled "OFFENDER SCORE" represent the offender score as determined by RCW 9.94A.525.

2. The following rules apply to the rows extending from the vertical axis of the sentencing grid:

    a. The row representing seriousness level 18 is reserved for the crime of aggravated murder in the first degree.

    b. No offense except for a class A felony may be sentenced according to the rows representing seriousness levels 10 and higher.

    c. No offense except for a class A or class B felony may be sentenced according to the rows representing seriousness levels six through nine.

3. Numbers in the cells occupying the rows of each seriousness level category represent the minimum and maximum number of months of the standard range sentence for each offender score. The values in each cell are calculated using the following formulas:

    a. For the row representing seriousness level 17: The minimum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 240 months. The minimum standard range sentence is 75 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for each cell. The maximum standard range sentence increases by 104 percent for each additional criminal history score point.

    b. For the rows representing seriousness levels 14 through 16:

        i. The maximum standard range sentence for a seriousness level 16 offense at an offender score of nine or more is 340 months. For each seriousness level from 14 through 16, the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more is 40 months higher than the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more for each seriousness level directly below.

        ii. The maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 45 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more. The maximum standard range sentence increases by 110 percent for each additional criminal history score point.

        iii. The minimum standard range sentence is 75 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for each cell.

    c. For the rows representing seriousness levels 10 through 13:

        i. The maximum standard range sentence for a seriousness level 13 offense at an offender score of nine or more is 220 months. For each seriousness level from 10 through 13, the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more is 25 months higher than the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more for each seriousness level directly below.

        ii. The maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 45 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more. The maximum standard sentence increases by 110 percent for each additional criminal history score point.

        iii. The minimum standard sentence is 60 percent of the maximum standard sentence for each cell.

    d. For the rows representing seriousness levels six through nine:

        i. The maximum standard range sentence for a seriousness level nine offense at an offender score of nine or more is 120 months. For each seriousness level from six through nine, the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more is 15 months higher than the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more for each seriousness level directly below.

        ii. The maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 27.5 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more. The maximum standard range sentence increases by 115 percent for each additional criminal history score point.

        iii. The minimum standard sentence is 60 percent of the maximum standard sentence for each cell.

    e. For the rows representing seriousness levels one through five:

        i. The maximum standard range sentence for a seriousness level five offense at an offender score of nine or more is 60 months. For each decrease in seriousness level from five to one, the maximum standard sentence for an offender score of nine or more decreases by 10.5 months rounded down to the nearest whole number.

        ii. The maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of zero is 20 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for an offender score of nine or more. The maximum standard range sentence increases by 120 percent for each additional criminal history score point.

        iii. The minimum standard range sentence is 30 percent of the maximum standard range sentence for each cell.

4. The numbers in the column titled "AGGRAVATED DEPARTURE CAP" represent the number of months equal to 10 percent of the maximum standard range sentence in each seriousness level, rounded down to the nearest whole number. Exceptional sentences that exceed the maximum standard range sentence plus the number of months signified in this column are presumed to be clearly excessive under RCW 9.94A.585.

5. As depicted by the column titled "REPEAT SV/VIOLENT, SEX, OR DV," the maximum standard range sentence for any person whose present conviction is for a violent offense or serious violent offense and who has one or more prior adult convictions for a violent offense or serious violent offense conviction, whose present conviction is for a sex offense and who has one or more prior adult convictions for a sex offense, or whose present conviction is for an offense where domestic violence as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 was pleaded and proven and who has one or more prior adult convictions for an offense where domestic violence as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 was pleaded and proven, increases as follows:

    a. If the present conviction is for a seriousness level one through five offense, the maximum standard range sentence is increased by 25 percent or one month, whichever is greater;

    b. If the present conviction is for a seriousness level six through 10 offense, the maximum standard range sentence is increased by 20 percent or one month, whichever is greater; or

    c. If the present conviction is for a seriousness level 11 through 17 offense, the maximum standard range sentence is increased by 15 percent or one month, whichever is greater.

6. Each cell on the grid includes a zone number underneath the minimum and maximum number of months of the standard range sentence. The zone numbers, which include zone 1, zone 2, zone 3, and zone 4, represent the following nonexhaustive list of available sentencing options depending on the zone of the present conviction:

    a. If the present conviction is for a zone 1 offense, the available sentencing options may include, but are not limited to:

        i. An intermediate sanctions sentencing alternative;

        ii. A residential substance use disorder treatment-based alternative under RCW 9.94A.664, if applicable; or

        iii. Confinement in a county jail.

## Section 4
The offender score is measured on the horizontal axis of the sentencing grid. The offender score rules are as follows:

The offender score is the sum of points accrued under this section rounded down to the nearest whole number.

1. [Empty]

    a. A prior conviction is a conviction which exists before the date of sentencing for the offense for which the offender score is being computed. Convictions entered or sentenced on the same date as the conviction for which the offender score is being computed shall be deemed "other current offenses" within the meaning of RCW 9.94A.589.

    b. For the purposes of this section, adjudications of guilt pursuant to Title 13 RCW which are not murder in the first or second degree or class A felony sex offenses may not be included in the offender score.

2. [Empty]

    a. Class A and sex prior felony convictions shall always be included in the offender score.

    b. Class B prior felony convictions other than sex offenses shall not be included in the offender score, if since the last date of release from confinement (including full-time residential treatment) pursuant to a felony conviction, if any, or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender had spent ten consecutive years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, confinement due to a violation of community custody conditions does not qualify as confinement for purposes of calculating time since the last date of release from confinement under this subsection. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, convictions for simple misdemeanor offenses do not qualify as crimes subsequently resulting in a conviction for purposes of this subsection, unless the offender has three or more simple misdemeanor convictions during the 10-year period.

    c. Except as provided in (e) of this subsection, class C prior felony convictions other than sex offenses shall not be included in the offender score if, since the last date of release from confinement (including full-time residential treatment) pursuant to a felony conviction, if any, or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender had spent five consecutive years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, confinement due to a violation of community custody conditions does not qualify as confinement for purposes of calculating time since the last date of release from confinement under this subsection. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, convictions for simple misdemeanor offenses do not qualify as crimes subsequently resulting in a conviction for purposes of this subsection, unless the offender has three or more simple misdemeanor convictions during the five-year period.

    d. Except as provided in (e) of this subsection, serious traffic convictions shall not be included in the offender score if, since the last date of release from confinement (including full-time residential treatment) pursuant to a conviction, if any, or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender spent five years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, confinement due to a violation of community custody conditions does not qualify as confinement for purposes of calculating time since the last date of release from confinement under this subsection. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, convictions for simple misdemeanor offenses do not qualify as crimes subsequently resulting in a conviction for purposes of this subsection, unless the offender has three or more simple misdemeanor convictions during the five-year period.

    e. If the present conviction is felony driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug (RCW 46.61.502(6)) or felony physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug (RCW 46.61.504(6)), all predicate crimes for the offense as defined by RCW 46.61.5055(14) shall be included in the offender score except that any nonfelony predicate crimes shall not be included for purposes of sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, and prior convictions for felony driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug (RCW 46.61.502(6)) or felony physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug (RCW 46.61.504(6)) shall always be included in the offender score. All other convictions of the defendant shall be scored according to this section.

    f. Prior convictions for a repetitive domestic violence offense, as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, shall not be included in the offender score if, since the last date of release from confinement or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender had spent ten consecutive years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, confinement due to a violation of community custody conditions does not qualify as confinement for purposes of calculating time since the last date of release from confinement under this subsection. For sentencing pursuant to section 1 of this act, convictions for simple misdemeanor offenses do not qualify as crimes subsequently resulting in a conviction for purposes of this subsection, unless the offender has three or more simple misdemeanor convictions during the 10-year period.

    g. This subsection applies to both prior adult convictions and prior juvenile adjudications.

3. Out-of-state convictions for offenses shall be classified according to the comparable offense definitions and sentences provided by Washington law. Federal convictions for offenses shall be classified according to the comparable offense definitions and sentences provided by Washington law. Neither out-of-state or federal convictions which would have been presumptively adjudicated in juvenile court under Washington law may be included in the offender score unless they are comparable to murder in the first or second degree or a class A felony sex offense. If there is no clearly comparable offense under Washington law or the offense is one that is usually considered subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction, the offense shall be scored as a class C felony equivalent if it was a felony under the relevant federal statute.

4. Score prior convictions for felony anticipatory offenses (attempts, criminal solicitations, and criminal conspiracies) the same as if they were convictions for completed offenses.

5. [Empty]

    a. In the case of multiple prior convictions, for the purpose of computing the offender score, count all convictions separately, except:

        i. Prior offenses which were found, under RCW 9.94A.589(1)(a), to encompass the same criminal conduct, shall be counted as one offense, the offense that yields the highest offender score. The current sentencing court shall determine with respect to other prior adult offenses for which sentences were served concurrently or prior juvenile offenses for which sentences were served consecutively, whether those offenses shall be counted as one offense or as separate offenses using the "same criminal conduct" analysis found in RCW 9.94A.589(1)(a), and if the court finds that they shall be counted as one offense, then the offense that yields the highest offender score shall be used. The current sentencing court may presume that such other prior offenses were not the same criminal conduct from sentences imposed on separate dates, or in separate counties or jurisdictions, or in separate complaints, indictments, or informations;

        ii. In the case of multiple prior convictions for offenses committed before July 1, 1986, for the purpose of computing the offender score, count all convictions or adjudications served concurrently as one offense. Use the conviction for the offense that yields the highest offender score.

    b. As used in this subsection (5), "served concurrently" means that: (i) The latter sentence was imposed with specific reference to the former; (ii) the concurrent relationship of the sentences was judicially imposed; and (iii) the concurrent timing of the sentences was not the result of a probation or parole revocation on the former offense.

6. If the present conviction is one of the anticipatory offenses of criminal attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy, count each prior conviction as if the present conviction were for a completed offense. When these convictions are used as criminal history, score them the same as a completed crime.

7. When calculating the offender score for offenses sentenced according to section 1 of this act:

    a. Except as provided in (b) through (e) of this subsection, count one point for each adult prior felony conviction and one point for each juvenile prior violent felony conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section.

    b. If the present conviction is for Escape from Community Custody, RCW 72.09.310, count only adult prior escape convictions in the offender score. Count prior escape convictions as one point.

    c. If the present conviction is for Escape 1, RCW 9A.76.110, or Escape 2, RCW 9A.76.120, count adult prior convictions as one point and juvenile prior convictions which are scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section as 1/2 point.

    d. If the present conviction is for a felony traffic offense other than felony driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, RCW 46.61.502(6), or felony physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, RCW 46.61.504(6), count one point for each adult prior felony conviction and 1/2 point for each juvenile prior violent felony conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section; for each serious traffic offense, other than those used for an enhancement pursuant to RCW 46.61.520(2), count one point for each adult prior conviction and 1/2 point for each juvenile prior conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section.

    e. If the present conviction is for homicide by watercraft or assault by watercraft count one point for each adult prior felony conviction and 1/2 point for each juvenile prior violent felony conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section; count one point for each adult prior conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or operation of a vessel while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.

8. When calculating the offender score for offenses sentenced according to RCW 9.94A.510:

    a. If the present conviction is for a nonviolent offense and not covered by (e), (f), or (g) of this subsection , count one point for each adult prior felony conviction and one point for each juvenile prior violent felony conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section.

    b. If the present conviction is for a violent offense and not covered in (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this subsection , count two points for each prior adult violent felony conviction and juvenile violent felony conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section, and one point for each prior adult nonviolent felony conviction.

    c. If the present conviction is for a serious violent offense, count three points for prior adult convictions and juvenile convictions which are scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section for crimes in this category, two points for each prior adult and scorable juvenile violent conviction (not already counted), and one point for each prior adult nonviolent felony conviction.

    d. If the present conviction is for Burglary 1, count prior convictions as in (b) of this subsection ; however count two points for each prior Burglary 2 or residential burglary conviction.

    e. If the present conviction is for a felony traffic offense count two points for each prior conviction for Vehicular Homicide or Vehicular Assault; for each felony offense count one point for each adult prior conviction and 1/2 point for each juvenile prior conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section; for each serious traffic offense, other than those used for an enhancement pursuant to RCW 46.61.520(2), count one point for each adult prior conviction and 1/2 point for each juvenile prior conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section; count one point for each adult prior conviction for operation of a vessel while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.

    f. If the present conviction is for homicide by watercraft or assault by watercraft count two points for each adult prior conviction for homicide by watercraft or assault by watercraft; for each felony offense count one point for each adult prior conviction and 1/2 point for each juvenile prior conviction which would be scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section; count one point for each adult prior conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, or operation of a vessel while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.

    g. If the present conviction is for manufacture of methamphetamine count three points for each adult prior manufacture of methamphetamine conviction. If the present conviction is for a drug offense and the offender has a criminal history that includes a sex offense or serious violent offense, count three points for each adult prior felony drug offense conviction. All other felonies are scored as in (b) of this subsection  if the current drug offense is violent, or as in (a) of this subsection  if the current drug offense is nonviolent.

    h. If the present conviction is for Escape from Community Custody, RCW 72.09.310, count only adult prior escape convictions in the offender score. Count prior escape convictions as one point.

        i. If the present conviction is for Escape 1, RCW 9A.76.110, or Escape 2, RCW 9A.76.120, count adult prior convictions as one point and juvenile prior convictions which are scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section as 1/2 point.

    j. If the present conviction is for Burglary 2 or residential burglary, count priors as in (a) of this subsection ; however, count two points for each prior Burglary 1 conviction, and two points for each prior Burglary 2 or residential burglary conviction.

    k. If the present conviction is for a sex offense, count priors as in (a) through (e) and (g) through (j) of this subsection; however count three points for each adult prior sex offense conviction and juvenile prior class A felony sex offense adjudication.

    l. If the present conviction is for failure to register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.130 or 9A.44.132, count priors as in (a) through (e) and (g) through (j) of this subsection; however count three points for each adult prior sex offense conviction and juvenile prior sex offense conviction which is scorable under subsection (1)(b) of this section, excluding adult prior convictions for failure to register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.130 or 9A.44.132, which shall count as one point.

    m. If the present conviction is for an offense committed while the offender was under community custody, add one point. For purposes of this subsection, community custody includes community placement or postrelease supervision, as defined in chapter 9.94B RCW.

    n. If the present conviction is for Theft of a Motor Vehicle, Possession of a Stolen Vehicle, Taking a Motor Vehicle Without Permission 1, or Taking a Motor Vehicle Without Permission 2, count priors as in (a) through (l) of this subsection; however count one point for prior convictions of Vehicle Prowling 2, and three points for each adult prior Theft 1 (of a motor vehicle), Theft 2 (of a motor vehicle), Possession of Stolen Property 1 (of a motor vehicle), Possession of Stolen Property 2 (of a motor vehicle), Theft of a Motor Vehicle, Possession of a Stolen Vehicle, Taking a Motor Vehicle Without Permission 1, or Taking a Motor Vehicle Without Permission 2 conviction.

    o. If the present conviction is for a felony domestic violence offense where domestic violence as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 was pleaded and proven, count priors as in (a) through (n) of this subsection; however, count points as follows:

        i. Count two points for each adult prior conviction where domestic violence as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 was pleaded and proven after August 1, 2011, for any of the following offenses: A felony violation of a no‑contact or protection order (RCW 7.105.450 or former RCW 26.50.110), felony Harassment (RCW 9A.46.020(2)(b)), felony Stalking (RCW 9A.46.110(5)(b)), Burglary 1 (RCW 9A.52.020), Kidnapping 1 (RCW 9A.40.020), Kidnapping 2 (RCW 9A.40.030), Unlawful imprisonment (RCW 9A.40.040), Robbery 1 (RCW 9A.56.200), Robbery 2 (RCW 9A.56.210), Assault 1 (RCW 9A.36.011), Assault 2 (RCW 9A.36.021), Assault 3 (RCW 9A.36.031), Arson 1 (RCW 9A.48.020), or Arson 2 (RCW 9A.48.030);

    p. The fact that a prior conviction was not included in an offender's offender score or criminal history at a previous sentencing shall have no bearing on whether it is included in the criminal history or offender score for the current offense. Prior convictions that were not counted in the offender score or included in criminal history under repealed or previous versions of the sentencing reform act shall be included in criminal history and shall count in the offender score if the current version of the sentencing reform act requires including or counting those convictions. Prior convictions that were not included in criminal history or in the offender score shall be included upon any resentencing to ensure imposition of an accurate sentence.

## Section 5
(1) The provisions of this section apply to the standard sentence ranges determined by section 1 of this act, RCW 9.94A.510, or 9.94A.517.

## Section 6
1. At any time prior to trial or entry of the guilty plea if substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced, the state may give notice that it is seeking a sentence above the standard sentencing range. The notice shall state aggravating circumstances upon which the requested sentence will be based.

2. In any case where an exceptional sentence above the standard range was imposed and where a new sentencing hearing is required, the superior court may impanel a jury to consider any alleged aggravating circumstances listed in RCW 9.94A.535(3), that were relied upon by the superior court in imposing the previous sentence, at the new sentencing hearing.

3. The facts supporting aggravating circumstances shall be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury's verdict on the aggravating factor must be unanimous, and by special interrogatory. If a jury is waived, proof shall be to the court beyond a reasonable doubt, unless the defendant stipulates to the aggravating facts.

4. Evidence regarding any facts supporting aggravating circumstances under RCW 9.94A.535(3) (a) through (y) shall be presented to the jury during the trial of the alleged crime, unless the jury has been impaneled solely for resentencing, or unless the state alleges the aggravating circumstances listed in RCW 9.94A.535(3) (e)(iv), (h)(i), (o), or (t). If one of these aggravating circumstances is alleged, the trial court may conduct a separate proceeding if the evidence supporting the aggravating fact is not part of the res geste of the charged crime, if the evidence is not otherwise admissible in trial of the charged crime, and if the court finds that the probative value of the evidence to the aggravated fact is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect on the jury's ability to determine guilt or innocence for the underlying crime.

5. If the superior court conducts a separate proceeding to determine the existence of aggravating circumstances listed in RCW 9.94A.535(3) (e)(iv), (h)(i), (o), or (t), the proceeding shall immediately follow the trial on the underlying conviction, if possible. If any person who served on the jury is unable to continue, the court shall substitute an alternate juror.

6. If the jury finds, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, one or more of the facts alleged by the state in support of an aggravated sentence, the court may sentence the offender pursuant to RCW 9.94A.535 to a term of confinement up to the maximum allowed under RCW 9A.20.021 for the underlying conviction if it finds, considering the purposes of this chapter, that the facts found are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence. In imposing a sentence above the standard sentence range for an offense committed on or after August 1, 2028, the court shall consider the threshold at which the sentence is presumed to be clearly excessive as indicated by the standard range sentence plus the maximum number of months in the column titled "aggravated departure cap" in the sentencing grid under section 1 of this act and under RCW 9.94A.585(4).

## Section 7
1. A sentence within the standard sentence range, under section 1 of this act, RCW 9.94A.510, or 9.94A.517, for an offense shall not be appealed. For purposes of this section, a sentence imposed on a first-time offender under RCW 9.94A.650 shall also be deemed to be within the standard sentence range for the offense and shall not be appealed.

2. A sentence outside the standard sentence range for the offense is subject to appeal by the defendant or the state. The appeal shall be to the court of appeals in accordance with rules adopted by the supreme court.

3. Pending review of the sentence, the sentencing court or the court of appeals may order the defendant confined or placed on conditional release, including bond.

4. To reverse a sentence which is outside the standard sentence range, the reviewing court must find: (a) Either that the reasons supplied by the sentencing court are not supported by the record which was before the judge or that those reasons do not justify a sentence outside the standard sentence range for that offense; or (b) that the sentence imposed was clearly excessive or clearly too lenient. A sentence imposed for an offense committed on or after August 1, 2028, that exceeds the standard range sentence plus the maximum number of months in the column titled "aggravated departure cap" on the sentencing grid under section 1 of this act is presumed to be clearly excessive.

5. A review under this section shall be made solely upon the record that was before the sentencing court. Written briefs shall not be required and the review and decision shall be made in an expedited manner according to rules adopted by the supreme court.

6. The court of appeals shall issue a written opinion in support of its decision whenever the judgment of the sentencing court is reversed and may issue written opinions in any other case where the court believes that a written opinion would provide guidance to sentencing courts and others in implementing this chapter and in developing a common law of sentencing within the state.

7. The department may petition for a review of a sentence committing an offender to the custody or jurisdiction of the department. The review shall be limited to errors of law. Such petition shall be filed with the court of appeals no later than ninety days after the department has actual knowledge of terms of the sentence. The petition shall include a certification by the department that all reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute at the superior court level have been exhausted.

## Section 8

This alternative must be served at and operated on the county level with state funding and in compliance with state standards, and must include both intermediate sanctions as well as access to rehabilitative and reintegration services and programs.

    j. The revocation process for the intermediate sanctions sentencing alternative, including consistent standards for conduct and circumstances that warrant revocation and return to incarceration;

    k. Statewide standards for intermediate sanctions sentencing alternative program operation;

    l. The method by which state funding is provided to the counties to operate their intermediate sanctions sentencing alternative programs, taking into consideration the juvenile block grant model;

3. If the court imposes a sentence requiring confinement of 30 days or less, the court may, in its discretion, specify that the sentence be served on consecutive or intermittent days. A sentence requiring more than 30 days of confinement shall be served on consecutive days. Local jail administrators may schedule court-ordered intermittent sentences as space permits.

4. If a sentence imposed includes payment of a legal financial obligation, it shall be imposed as provided in RCW 9.94A.750, 9.94A.753, and 9.94A.760.

5. Except as provided under RCW 9.94A.750(4) and 9.94A.753(4), a court may not impose a sentence providing for a term of confinement or community custody that exceeds the statutory maximum for the crime as provided in chapter 9A.20 RCW.

6. The sentencing court shall give the offender credit for all confinement time served before the sentencing if that confinement was solely in regard to the offense for which the offender is being sentenced.

7. The sentencing court shall not give the offender credit for any time the offender was required to comply with an electronic monitoring program prior to sentencing if the offender was convicted of one of the following offenses:

    a. A violent offense;

    b. Any sex offense;

    c. Any drug offense;

    d. Reckless burning in the first or second degree as defined in RCW 9A.48.040 or 9A.48.050;

    e. Assault in the third degree as defined in RCW 9A.36.031;

    f. Assault of a child in the third degree;

    g. Unlawful imprisonment as defined in RCW 9A.40.040; or

    h. Harassment as defined in RCW 9A.46.020.

8. The court shall order restitution as provided in RCW 9.94A.750 and 9.94A.753.

9. As a part of any sentence, the court may impose and enforce crime-related prohibitions and affirmative conditions as provided in this chapter. "Crime-related prohibitions" may include a prohibition on the use or possession of alcohol or controlled substances if the court finds that any chemical dependency or substance abuse contributed to the offense.

10. In any sentence of partial confinement, the court may require the offender to serve the partial confinement in work release, in a program of home detention, on work crew, or in a combined program of work crew and home detention.

2. The court may utilize any other sanctions or alternatives as authorized by law, including but not limited to the special drug offender sentencing alternative under RCW 9.94A.660 or drug court under chapter 2.30 RCW.

3. Nothing in this section creates an entitlement for a criminal defendant to any specific sanction, alternative, sentence option, or substance abuse treatment.

## Section 20
1. The intersection of the column defined by the offender score and the row defined by the offense seriousness score determines the standard sentence range (see section 1 of this act, (Table 1), RCW 9.94A.510, (Table 3), and RCW 9.94A.517, (Table 5)). The additional time for deadly weapon findings or for other adjustments as specified in RCW 9.94A.533 shall be added to the entire standard sentence range. The court may impose any sentence within the range that it deems appropriate. All standard sentence ranges are expressed in terms of total confinement.

2. In determining any sentence other than a sentence above the standard range, the trial court may rely on no more information than is admitted by the plea agreement, or admitted, acknowledged, or proved in a trial or at the time of sentencing, or proven pursuant to RCW 9.94A.537. Where the defendant disputes material facts, the court must either not consider the fact or grant an evidentiary hearing on the point. The facts shall be deemed proved at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence, except as otherwise specified in RCW 9.94A.537. On remand for resentencing following appeal or collateral attack, the parties shall have the opportunity to present and the court to consider all relevant evidence regarding criminal history, including criminal history not previously presented.

3. In determining any sentence above the standard sentence range, the court shall follow the procedures set forth in RCW 9.94A.537. Facts that establish the elements of a more serious crime or additional crimes may not be used to go outside the standard sentence range except upon stipulation or when specifically provided for in RCW 9.94A.535(3)(d), (e), (g), and (h).

## Section 21
1. An offender is eligible for the special drug offender sentencing alternative if:

    a. The offender is convicted of a felony that is not a violent offense and the violation does not involve a sentence enhancement under RCW 9.94A.533  (4) or (5);

    b. The offender is convicted of a felony that is not a felony driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug under RCW 46.61.502(6) or felony physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug under RCW 46.61.504(6);

    c. The offender has no current or prior convictions for a sex offense for which the offender is currently or may be required to register pursuant to RCW 9A.44.130;

    d. The offender has no prior convictions in this state, and no prior convictions for an equivalent out-of-state or federal offense, for the following offenses during the following time frames:

        i. Robbery in the second degree that did not involve the use of a firearm and was not reduced from robbery in the first degree within seven years before conviction of the current offense; or

        ii. Any other violent offense within ten years before conviction of the current offense;

    e. For a violation of the uniform controlled substances act under chapter 69.50 RCW or a criminal solicitation to commit such a violation under chapter 9A.28 RCW, the offense involved only a small quantity of the particular controlled substance as determined by the judge upon consideration of such factors as the weight, purity, packaging, sale price, and street value of the controlled substance;

    f. The offender has not been found by the United States attorney general to be subject to a deportation detainer or order and does not become subject to a deportation order during the period of the sentence; and

    g. The offender has not received a drug offender sentencing alternative more than once in the prior ten years before the current offense.

2. A motion for a special drug offender sentencing alternative may be made by the court, the offender, or the state.

3. If the sentencing court determines that the offender is eligible for an alternative sentence under this section and that the alternative sentence is appropriate, the court shall waive imposition of a sentence within the standard sentence range and impose a sentence consisting of either a prison-based alternative under RCW 9.94A.662 or a residential substance use disorder treatment-based alternative under RCW 9.94A.664. The residential substance use disorder treatment-based alternative is only available if the midpoint of the standard range is twenty-six months or less.

4. [Empty]

    a. To assist the court in making its determination, the court may order the department to complete either or both a risk assessment report and a substance use disorder screening report as provided in RCW 9.94A.500.

    b. To assist the court in making its determination in domestic violence cases, the court shall order the department to complete a presentence investigation and a chemical dependency screening report as provided in RCW 9.94A.500, unless otherwise specifically waived by the court.

5. If the court is considering imposing a sentence under the residential substance use disorder treatment-based alternative, the court may order an examination of the offender by the department. The examination must be performed by an agency certified by the department of health to provide substance use disorder services. The examination shall, at a minimum, address the following issues:

    a. Whether the offender suffers from a substance use disorder;

    b. Whether the substance use disorder is such that there is a probability that criminal behavior will occur in the future;

    c. Whether effective treatment for the offender's substance use disorder is available from a provider that has been licensed or certified by the department of health, and where applicable, whether effective domestic violence perpetrator treatment is available from a state-certified domestic violence treatment provider pursuant to RCW 43.20A.735; and

    d. Whether the offender and the community will benefit from the use of the alternative.

6. When a court imposes a sentence of community custody under this section:

    a. The court may impose conditions as provided in RCW 9.94A.703 and may impose other affirmative conditions as the court considers appropriate. In addition, an offender may be required to pay thirty dollars per month while on community custody to offset the cost of monitoring for alcohol or controlled substances, or in cases of domestic violence for monitoring with global positioning system technology for compliance with a no-contact order.

    b. The department may impose conditions and sanctions as authorized in RCW 9.94A.704 and 9.94A.737.

7. [Empty]

    a. The court may bring any offender sentenced under this section back into court at any time on its own initiative to evaluate the offender's progress in treatment or to determine if any violations of the conditions of the sentence have occurred.

    b. If the offender is brought back to court, the court may modify the conditions of the community custody or impose sanctions under (c) of this subsection.

    c. The court may order the offender to serve a term of total confinement within the standard range of the offender's current offense at any time during the period of community custody if the offender violates the conditions or requirements of the sentence or if the offender is failing to make satisfactory progress in treatment.

    d. An offender ordered to serve a term of total confinement under (c) of this subsection shall receive credit for time previously served in total or partial confinement and inpatient treatment under this section, and shall receive fifty percent credit for time previously served in community custody under this section.

8. In serving a term of community custody imposed upon failure to complete, or administrative termination from, the special drug offender sentencing alternative program, the offender shall receive no credit for time served in community custody prior to termination of the offender's participation in the program.

9. An offender sentenced under this section shall be subject to all rules relating to earned release time with respect to any period served in total confinement.

10. The Washington state institute for public policy shall submit a report to the governor and the appropriate committees of the legislature by November 1, 2022, analyzing the effectiveness of the drug offender sentencing alternative in reducing recidivism among various offender populations. An additional report is due November 1, 2028, and every five years thereafter. The Washington state institute for public policy may coordinate with the department and the caseload forecast council in tracking data and preparing the report.

## Section 22
1. [Empty]

    a. The term of the sentence of an offender committed to a correctional facility operated by the department may be reduced by earned release time in accordance with procedures that shall be developed and adopted by the correctional agency having jurisdiction in which the offender is confined. The earned release time shall be for good behavior and good performance, as determined by the correctional agency having jurisdiction. The correctional agency shall not credit the offender with earned release credits in advance of the offender actually earning the credits.

    b. Any program established pursuant to this section shall allow an offender to earn early release credits for presentence incarceration. If an offender is transferred from a county jail to the department, the administrator of a county jail facility shall certify to the department the amount of time spent in custody at the facility and the number of days of early release credits lost or not earned. The department may approve a jail certification from a correctional agency that calculates early release time based on the actual amount of confinement time served by the offender before sentencing when an erroneous calculation of confinement time served by the offender before sentencing appears on the judgment and sentence. The department must adjust an offender's rate of early release listed on the jail certification to be consistent with the rate applicable to offenders in the department's facilities. However, the department is not authorized to adjust the number of presentence early release days that the jail has certified as lost or not earned.

2. [Empty]

    a. An offender who has been convicted of a felony committed after July 23, 1995, that involves any applicable deadly weapon enhancements under RCW 9.94A.533  (4) or (5), or both, shall not receive any good time credits or earned release time for that portion of his or her sentence that results from any deadly weapon enhancements.

    b. An offender whose sentence includes any impaired driving enhancements under RCW 9.94A.533(8), minor child enhancements under RCW 9.94A.533(14), or both, shall not receive any good time credits or earned release time for any portion of his or her sentence that results from those enhancements.

3. An offender may earn early release time as follows:

    a. In the case of an offender sentenced pursuant to RCW 10.95.030(2) or 10.95.035, the offender may not receive any earned early release time during the minimum term of confinement imposed by the court; for any remaining portion of the sentence served by the offender, the aggregate earned release time may not exceed 10 percent of the sentence.

    b. In the case of an offender convicted of a serious violent offense, or a sex offense that is a class A felony, committed on or after July 1, 1990, and before July 1, 2003, the aggregate earned release time may not exceed 15 percent of the sentence.

    c. In the case of an offender convicted of a serious violent offense, or a sex offense that is a class A felony, committed on or after July 1, 2003, the aggregate earned release time may not exceed 10 percent of the sentence.

    d. An offender is qualified to earn up to 50 percent of aggregate earned release time if he or she:

        i. Is not classified as an offender who is at a high risk to reoffend as provided in subsection (4) of this section;

        ii. Is not confined pursuant to a sentence for:

(A) A sex offense;

(B) A violent offense;

(C) A crime against persons as defined in RCW 9.94A.411;

(D) A felony that is domestic violence as defined in RCW 10.99.020;

(E) A violation of RCW 9A.52.025 (residential burglary);

(F) A violation of, or an attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to violate, RCW 69.50.401 by manufacture or delivery or possession with intent to deliver methamphetamine; or

(G) A violation of, or an attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to violate, RCW 69.50.406 (delivery of a controlled substance to a minor);

        iii. Has no prior conviction for the offenses listed in (d)(ii) of this subsection;

        iv. Participates in programming or activities as directed by the offender's individual reentry plan as provided under RCW 72.09.270 to the extent that such programming or activities are made available by the department; and

    v. Has not committed a new felony after July 22, 2007, while under community custody.

    e. In no other case shall the aggregate earned release time exceed one-third of the total sentence.

4. The department shall perform a risk assessment of each offender who may qualify for earned early release under subsection (3)(d) of this section utilizing the risk assessment tool recommended by the Washington state institute for public policy. Subsection (3)(d) of this section does not apply to offenders convicted after July 1, 2010.

5. [Empty]

    a. A person who is eligible for earned early release as provided in this section and who will be supervised by the department pursuant to RCW 9.94A.501 or 9.94A.5011, shall be transferred to community custody in lieu of earned release time;

    b. The department shall, as a part of its program for release to the community in lieu of earned release, require the offender to propose a release plan that includes an approved residence and living arrangement. All offenders with community custody terms eligible for release to community custody in lieu of earned release shall provide an approved residence and living arrangement prior to release to the community;

    c. The department may deny transfer to community custody in lieu of earned release time if the department determines an offender's release plan, including proposed residence location and living arrangements, may violate the conditions of the sentence or conditions of supervision, place the offender at risk to violate the conditions of the sentence, place the offender at risk to reoffend, or present a risk to victim safety or community safety. The department's authority under this section is independent of any court-ordered condition of sentence or statutory provision regarding conditions for community custody;

    d. If the department is unable to approve the offender's release plan, the department may do one or more of the following:

        i. Transfer an offender to partial confinement in lieu of earned early release for a period not to exceed three months. The three months in partial confinement is in addition to that portion of the offender's term of confinement that may be served in partial confinement as provided in RCW 9.94A.728(1)(e);

        ii. Provide rental vouchers to the offender for a period not to exceed six months if rental assistance will result in an approved release plan.

A voucher must be provided in conjunction with additional transition support programming or services that enable an offender to participate in services including, but not limited to, substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment, sex offender treatment, educational programming, or employment programming;

    e. The department shall maintain a list of housing providers that meets the requirements of RCW 72.09.285. If more than two voucher recipients will be residing per dwelling unit, as defined in RCW 59.18.030, rental vouchers for those recipients may only be paid to a housing provider on the department's list;

    f. For each offender who is the recipient of a rental voucher, the department shall gather data as recommended by the Washington state institute for public policy in order to best demonstrate whether rental vouchers are effective in reducing recidivism.

6. An offender serving a term of confinement imposed under RCW 9.94A.670(5)(a) is not eligible for earned release credits under this section.

## Section 23
1. In a prosecution of a criminal street gang-related felony offense, the prosecution may file a special allegation that the felony offense involved the compensation, threatening, or solicitation of a minor in order to involve that minor in the commission of the felony offense, as described under RCW 9.94A.533(11)(a).

2. The state has the burden of proving a special allegation made under this section beyond a reasonable doubt. If a jury is had, the jury shall, if it finds the defendant guilty, also find a special verdict as to whether the criminal street gang-related felony offense involved the compensation, threatening, or solicitation of a minor in order to involve that minor in the commission of the felony offense. If no jury is had, the court shall make a finding of fact as to whether the criminal street gang-related felony offense involved the compensation, threatening, or solicitation of a minor in order to involve that minor in the commission of the felony offense.

## Section 24
Any and all law enforcement agencies and personnel, criminal justice attorneys, sentencing judges, and state and local correctional facilities and personnel may, but are not required to, give any and all offenders either written or oral notice, or both, of the sanctions imposed and criminal justice changes regarding armed offenders, including but not limited to the subjects of:
