# HB 2401 - Refrigerant gases

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2401.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that hydrofluorocarbons are climate pollutants that pose significant threats to our environment. Although hydrofluorocarbons currently represent a small portion of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, emissions of hydrofluorocarbons have been rapidly increasing in the United States and worldwide, and they are hundreds to thousands of times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. Preventing the release of hydrofluorocarbons is among the highest global impact measures to address the climate crisis.

2. In 2019 and 2021, the legislature took significant steps towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from hydrofluorocarbons by transitioning to the use of less damaging hydrofluorocarbons or other suitable substitutes in several new end-uses including their largest end-uses where they are used as refrigerants as well instituting a statewide refrigerant management program. However, significant sources of hydrofluorocarbons and refrigerant emissions in Washington remain unaddressed because vast quantities of refrigerants are contained inside the installed base of heating and cooling equipment beyond those covered by the statewide refrigerant management program. There is a dire need for improving life-cycle refrigerant management to prevent those refrigerants from being emitted into the atmosphere.

3. On a national and global scale, the United States has begun implementing a phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons. The United States has ratified the global Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol, an international agreement to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons by 85 percent by 2036. Domestically, in 2020, the United States congress enacted the American innovation and manufacturing act which closely matches the Kigali amendment's phase-down schedule. Any state actions that complement the phasedown by reducing demand of newly produced hydrofluorocarbons will help actualize the vast climate benefits expected from the American innovation and manufacturing act and the Kigali amendment.

4. As in any circular economy, an important lever for reducing demand for new or virgin material is to maximize the recovery, recycling, reclaiming, and reuse of existing material. The same principle can be successfully applied to refrigerants. However, the current state regulatory environment notably lacks a mechanism to ensure that refrigerants and greenhouse gases are recovered, reclaimed, and put back into the economy for reuse. Recognizing the benefits of minimizing refrigerant releases and maximizing reclamation, the United States environmental protection agency has recently proposed rules to require the use of reclaimed refrigerants in various sectors, including commercial and industrial refrigeration as well as air conditioners and heat pumps. Due to those pending federal regulations requiring the use of reclaimed refrigerants, it is in the state's interest to incentivize a refrigerant recovery, reclamation, and recycling program to ensure an adequate supply of refrigerant chemicals exists for Washington users as the transition to chemicals with lower climate-polluting risks takes place.

5. Implementation of extended producer responsibility schemes in Washington and other leading states, including a bounty to be paid to service technicians and others for recovered gas, will incentivize a greater supply of used fluorinated refrigerants removed from equipment, which can then be reclaimed and reused. Increasing the supply of reclaimed refrigerants available to fulfill the demand for refrigerants in existing and new equipment will support smooth implementation of federal regulations under the American innovation and manufacturing act. It will also increase the supply of refrigerants for ramping new heat pump adoption to decarbonize the building stock. Overall, greater reclamation of hydrofluorocarbons will not only prevent direct greenhouse gas emissions but also support the state's building electrification and heat pump adoption goals.

6. Once the need for reclaimed refrigerants has passed in the future, the most polluting refrigerant chemicals should be safely destroyed.

2. [Empty]

    a. The refrigerant stewardship organization must develop and implement a system to collect charges from participating producers to cover the costs of plan implementation in an equitable, environmentally sound, and socially just manner. Except as provided in (e) of this subsection, the refrigerant stewardship organization's system of charges must utilize a standard per-mass unit assessment applied based on the volume of covered refrigerants introduced into Washington.

    b. The system of charges must apply equally regardless of whether that refrigerant is contained in precharged equipment or manufactured, imported, distributed, or sold directly onto the market as bulk covered refrigerants.

    c. In 2029, an initial rate of at least $7.00 per pound of covered refrigerant must be used to calculate the charges due from producers in the first year of the program.

    d. In subsequent years, the charges due from producers may be adjusted as follows:

        i. The refrigerant stewardship organization may propose an adjustment to the department to adjust the rate based on the performance assessment described in section 5 of this act, and the department may review and make a determination whether to approve the adjustment; or

        ii. The department may of its own volition adjust the rate based on the performance assessment described in section 5 of this act.

    e. Applicable no earlier than in calendar year 2031 of program operations, and using the process specified in (d) of this subsection, the refrigerant stewardship organization's system of charge may utilize an assessment that is weighted based on the global warming potential of each covered refrigerant, with a proportionally higher fee being assessed for gases with comparatively higher global warming potential.

3. The system of charges must use ecomodulated fees to encourage the use of design attributes that reduce the environmental impacts of covered refrigerants. Examples of ecomodulated fees include, but are not limited to:

    a. Encouraging designs or business models intended to facilitate recovery, reclamation, and reuse of refrigerants;

    b. Encouraging the use of reclaimed refrigerants; and

    c. Encouraging a sliding scale of fees based upon refrigerant global warming potential.

4. The refrigerant stewardship organization is responsible for all costs of recovered covered refrigerant collection, transportation, processing, education, administration, and agency reimbursement in accordance with best environmental management practices.

5. The refrigerant stewardship organization is not authorized to reduce or cease collection, education and outreach, or other activities implemented under an approved plan based on the achievement of program performance goals or achieving a level of programmatic efficacy that is higher than that required in section 5 of this act.

6. [Empty]

    a. To encourage persons to manage recovered covered refrigerants through the program and to ensure that the program goals established in section 5 of this act are achieved, the refrigerant stewardship organization must propose in its plan, and carry out in its program, the payment of a financial incentive for each mass unit, such as pound of covered refrigerant, that a person furnishes to the program for management. This financial incentive is not required to be consistent with the amount specified in subsection (2) of this section. The refrigerant stewardship organization must demonstrate to the department that the amount of the financial incentive for each unit of covered refrigerant will be sufficient to incentivize the use of the program by service technicians or other persons with unwanted recovered covered refrigerant, to discourage illegal dumping or venting of refrigerants or other pollutants, and must be in addition to any other incentive payments offered for the same covered products through utility rebate, energy efficiency, or other programs.

    b. The financial incentives offered through the program may vary as appropriate to ensure the achievement of the goals established in section 5 of this act in an efficient manner. In developing the financial incentives, the refrigerant stewardship organization may consider any combination of the following:

        i. The volume of recovered covered refrigerant furnished by a person;

        ii. The type and purity of recovered covered refrigerant; and

        iii. Whether the recovered covered refrigerant has been collected and furnished to the program in a manner that minimizes the costs and environmental impacts of managing that refrigerant and whether it has been collected and furnished in a manner that facilitates the reuse of the refrigerant rather than its destruction, where appropriate.

7. The refrigerant stewardship organization must reimburse demonstrable costs incurred at a collection site as a result of a serving as a collection site for the program including, but not limited to, associated labor costs, transportation costs, and other costs associated with safety, accessibility, and operation of the collection site.

8. It is the intent of the legislature to not incentivize refrigerant destruction under this chapter. As the nationwide hydrofluorocarbon phasedown ramps down the use of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, the department may evaluate the benefits of incentivizing destruction. On or after January 1, 2035, the department may, by rule, set an incentive for destruction of covered refrigerants which may not be used for any carbon credits or other greenhouse gas offset credits, including under chapter 70A.65 RCW.

9. If more than one refrigerant stewardship organization is registered within the state, each refrigerant stewardship organization must coordinate with other refrigerant stewardship organizations to provide reimbursement, to ensure that covered refrigerants are not reported as supplied or managed by more than one refrigerant stewardship organization, and to ensure that one or more of the registered refrigerant stewardship organizations do not inequitably subsidize the operations of other registered refrigerant stewardship organizations through the overpayment of financial incentives to service technicians and other persons relative to that refrigerant stewardship organization or refrigerant stewardship organization's share of covered refrigerants that it is responsible for in the state.

## Section 9
1. Beginning July 1, 2029, retail establishments may not sell, offer for sale, otherwise make available for sale, install, or otherwise furnish to customers a covered refrigerant precharged equipment unless the producer of the covered refrigerant participates in a refrigerant stewardship organization.

2. A refrigerant service provider or retail establishment is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section and is not subject to penalties as long as the website made available by the department under section 12 of this act lists, as of the date a product is made available for retail sale, a producer of a covered product, or brand and appliance model of a covered appliance, sold by the retail establishment or refrigerant service provider as being a participant in an approved plan or the implementer of an approved plan.

3. A retail establishment that sells precharged equipment containing covered refrigerant is not required to make retail locations available to serve as collection sites or services for a program operated by a refrigerant stewardship organization. However, a retail establishment that agrees to make a retail location available to serve as a collection site or otherwise offers refrigerant recovery services for a program must comply with the requirements for collection sites and service providers, consistent with section 6 of this act.

4. A retail establishment selling or offering precharged equipment containing covered refrigerant for sale in Washington must provide information to customers, provided to the retail establishment or refrigerant service provider by the refrigerant stewardship organization, regarding available end-of-life management options for covered products collected by the refrigerant stewardship organization. The information that a refrigerant stewardship organization must make available to retail establishments and refrigerant service providers must include, but is not limited to, in-store signage, written materials, and other promotional materials that retail establishments and refrigerant service providers must use to inform customers of the available end-of-life management options for covered products collected by the refrigerant stewardship organization. All materials developed by a refrigerant stewardship organization under this subsection must:

    a. Emphasize to consumers the importance of using the program established under this chapter for unwanted covered products;

    b. Encourage customers to choose a service technician participating in the program and encourage customers to confirm with their service technician that the customer's refrigerants will be reclaimed; and

    c. Identify the prohibitions under federal law and chapters 70A.15 and 70A.60 RCW on the willful release of refrigerants.

5. Retail establishments, refrigerant service providers, producers, or refrigerant stewardship organizations may not charge a point-of-sale fee to consumers to cover the administrative or operational costs of the refrigerant stewardship organization or the program.
