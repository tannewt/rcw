<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that hydrofluorocarbons are climate pollutants that pose significant threats to our environment. Although hydrofluorocarbons currently represent a small portion of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, emissions of hydrofluorocarbons have been rapidly increasing in the United States and worldwide, and they are hundreds to thousands of times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. Preventing the release of hydrofluorocarbons is among the highest global impact measures to address the climate crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2019 and 2021, the legislature took significant steps towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from hydrofluorocarbons by transitioning to the use of less damaging hydrofluorocarbons or other suitable substitutes in several new end-uses including their largest end-uses where they are used as refrigerants as well instituting a statewide refrigerant management program. However, significant sources of hydrofluorocarbons and refrigerant emissions in Washington remain unaddressed because vast quantities of refrigerants are contained inside the installed base of heating and cooling equipment beyond those covered by the statewide refrigerant management program. There is a dire need for improving life-cycle refrigerant management to prevent those refrigerants from being emitted into the atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a national and global scale, the United States has begun implementing a phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons. The United States has ratified the global Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol, an international agreement to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons by 85 percent by 2036. Domestically, in 2020, the United States congress enacted the American innovation and manufacturing act which closely matches the Kigali amendment's phase-down schedule. Any state actions that complement the phasedown by reducing demand of newly produced hydrofluorocarbons will help actualize the vast climate benefits expected from the American innovation and manufacturing act and the Kigali amendment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As in any circular economy, an important lever for reducing demand for new or virgin material is to maximize the recovery, recycling, reclaiming, and reuse of existing material. The same principle can be successfully applied to refrigerants. However, the current state regulatory environment notably lacks a mechanism to ensure that refrigerants and greenhouse gases are recovered, reclaimed, and put back into the economy for reuse. Recognizing the benefits of minimizing refrigerant releases and maximizing reclamation, the United States environmental protection agency has recently proposed rules to require the use of reclaimed refrigerants in various sectors, including commercial and industrial refrigeration as well as air conditioners and heat pumps. Due to those pending federal regulations requiring the use of reclaimed refrigerants, it is in the state's interest to incentivize a refrigerant recovery, reclamation, and recycling program to ensure an adequate supply of refrigerant chemicals exists for Washington users as the transition to chemicals with lower climate-polluting risks takes place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of extended producer responsibility schemes in Washington and other leading states, including a bounty to be paid to service technicians and others for recovered gas, will incentivize a greater supply of used fluorinated refrigerants removed from equipment, which can then be reclaimed and reused. Increasing the supply of reclaimed refrigerants available to fulfill the demand for refrigerants in existing and new equipment will support smooth implementation of federal regulations under the American innovation and manufacturing act. It will also increase the supply of refrigerants for ramping new heat pump adoption to decarbonize the building stock. Overall, greater reclamation of hydrofluorocarbons will not only prevent direct greenhouse gas emissions but also support the state's building electrification and heat pump adoption goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the need for reclaimed refrigerants has passed in the future, the most polluting refrigerant chemicals should be safely destroyed.</p>

<li>
<p>The system of charges must apply equally regardless of whether that refrigerant is contained in precharged equipment or manufactured, imported, distributed, or sold directly onto the market as bulk covered refrigerants. For precharged equipment, the system of charges may rely on reasonable estimations of refrigerant volumes contained in the precharged equipment.</p>

<p>To allow a refrigerant stewardship organization to establish an equitable and reasonable system of charges for producers of precharged equipment and bulk covered refrigerants, and to allow the refrigerant stewardship organization to calculate recovery rates for purposes of section 5 of this act, a refrigerant stewardship organization may require a producer to provide product specifications and product sale and distribution volumes in or into Washington for precharged equipment and bulk covered refrigerants.</p>

<li>
<p>In 2028, an initial rate of at least $7.00 per pound of covered refrigerant must be used to calculate the charges due from producers in the first year of the program.</p>

<p>To encourage persons to manage recovered covered refrigerants through the program and to ensure that the program targets established in section 5 of this act are achieved, a refrigerant stewardship organization must propose in its plan, and carry out in its program, the payment of a financial incentive for each mass unit, such as pound of covered refrigerant, that a person furnishes to the program for management. This financial incentive is not required to be consistent with the amount specified in subsection (2) of this section. A refrigerant stewardship organization must demonstrate to the department that the amount of the financial incentive for each unit of covered refrigerant will be sufficient to incentivize the use of the program by service technicians or other persons with unwanted recovered covered refrigerant, to discourage illegal dumping or venting of refrigerants or other pollutants, and must be in addition to any other incentive payments offered for the same covered refrigerants or precharged equipment through utility rebate, energy efficiency, or other programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The financial incentives offered through the program may vary as appropriate to ensure the achievement of the performance targets established in section 5 of this act in an efficient manner. In developing the financial incentives, a refrigerant stewardship organization may consider any combination of the following:</p>

<li>
<p>The volume of recovered covered refrigerant furnished by a person;</p>

<li>
<p>The type and purity of recovered covered refrigerant; and</p>
