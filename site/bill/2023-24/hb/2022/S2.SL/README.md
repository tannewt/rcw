# HB 2022 - Construction crane safety

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2022-S2.SL.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that there is significant opportunity to improve worker and public safety in tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration. The Seattle tower crane incident on April 27, 2019, killing two members of the public, Sarah Pantip Wong and Alan Jay Justad, and two iron workers, Travis Daniel Corbet and Andrew W. Yoder, exposed weaknesses in construction safety efforts. Requirements for permitting, street closures, and penalties are created to ensure that assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of tower cranes proceed safely.

## Section 2
Sections 3 through 10 of this act apply to construction crane safety.

## Section 3
The definitions in this section apply throughout this section and sections 4 through 7 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    c. Crane owners must ensure that cranes are inspected and load proof tested by a certified crane inspector at least annually and after any significant modification or significant repairs of structural parts. If the use of weights for a unit proof load test is not possible or reasonable, other recording test equipment may be used. In adopting rules implementing this requirement, the department may consider similar standards and practices used by the federal government;

    d. Tower cranes and tower crane assembly parts must be inspected by a certified crane inspector  prior to and following every assembly , disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane.

    c. Requirements that the prime contractor of the construction project ensure that a qualified technical representative of the distributor or manufacturer who is knowledgeable of assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration procedures will be present during assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane to assure that such procedures are performed in accordance with manufacturer operation instructions and guidelines;

    d. Requiring prime contractors of construction projects to follow crane manufacturer operation instructions and guidelines or alternate plans/instructions approved by a registered professional engineer when assembling, disassembling, and reconfiguring a tower crane;

    e. Requiring the presence of an assembly/disassembly director at every tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration to directly oversee all work performed. The assembly/disassembly director may not serve in any other capacity while directly supervising a tower crane assembly, disassembly, or reconfiguration procedure;

    f. Conducting programmed inspections of workplaces that contain tower cranes;

    g. Establishing requirements for the maximum allowable wind speed for tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration;

    h. Establishing requirements for a written job plan that addresses the requirements of the manufacturer's manual tailored to the site conditions where the tower crane will be installed, as appropriate for assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane;

        i. Establishing requirements that must be met to be considered a competent and qualified assembly/disassembly director including, beginning January 1, 2027, or 12 months after the date an applicable certification program is approved by a nationally accredited organization recognized by the department, certification from a national organization recognized by the department;

    j. Establishing effective stop work procedures that ensure the authority of any employee, including employees of contractors, to refuse or delay the performance of a task related to a tower crane that the employee believes could reasonably result in serious physical harm or death. The rules must ensure that employees who exercise stop work authority are protected from intimidation, retaliation, or discrimination; and

    k. Other rules necessary to implement sections 3 through 7 of this act.

3. The department may set fees in rule to be charged for permits issued under section 4 of this act in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of administering section 4 of this act. Fees shall be deposited in the industrial insurance trust funds.

## Section 7
A tower crane manufacturer and distributor shall, without exception, provide all relevant manufacturer operation instructions and guidelines, including assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration instructions, for the safe use and maintenance of all of the manufacturer's or distributor's tower cranes located in the state to any person who requests access to such materials. The prescribed information, format, and distribution channel must be determined by the department. These materials must be written in the English language with customary grammar and punctuation. Information must be provided within a reasonable time frame, as determined by the department.

## Section 8
1. When a worksite contains a tower crane, the local government in which the tower crane is located must, at a minimum, do the following before any assembly, disassembly, or reconfiguration of the tower crane:

    a. Align permit issuance for street closures with the definition of assembly/disassembly work zone when a tower crane is being assembled, disassembled, reconfigured, or otherwise not fully stabilized and secure;

    b. Issue street closure permits with consideration for sufficient time, as defined by the permit applicant, to safely conduct assembly, disassembly, or reconfiguration; and

    c. Develop permitting procedures that provide notice to residents and occupants in buildings within the assembly/disassembly work zone in advance of any assembly, disassembly, or reconfiguration.

2. For purposes of this section, "assembly, disassembly, or reconfiguration" and "assembly/disassembly work zone" have the same meanings as those terms are defined in RCW 49.17.400.
