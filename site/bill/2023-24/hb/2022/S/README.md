# HB 2022 - Construction crane safety

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2022-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that there is significant opportunity to improve worker and public safety in tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration. The Seattle tower crane incident on April 27, 2019, killing two members of the public, Sarah Pantip Wong and Alan Jay Justad, and two iron workers, Travis Daniel Corbet and Andrew W. Yoder, exposed weaknesses in construction safety efforts. Requirements for permitting, street closures, and penalties are created to ensure that assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of tower cranes proceed safely.

The assembly/disassembly director may not serve in any other capacity while directly supervising a tower crane assembly, disassembly, or reconfiguration procedure;

    f. Conducting programmed inspections of workplaces that contain tower cranes;

    g. Establishing requirements for the maximum allowable wind speed for tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration;

    h. Establishing requirements for a written job plan that addresses the requirements of the manufacturer's manual tailored to the site conditions where the tower crane will be installed, as appropriate for assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane;

        i. Establishing requirements that must be met to be considered a competent and qualified assembly/disassembly director;

Establishing effective stop work procedures that ensure the authority of any employee, including employees of contractors, to refuse or delay the performance of a task related to a tower crane that the employee believes could reasonably result in serious physical harm or death. The rules must ensure that employees who exercise stop work authority are protected from intimidation, retaliation, or discrimination; and

    k. Other rules necessary to implement sections 3 through 7 of this act.

3. The department may set fees in rule to be charged for permits issued under section 4 of this act in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of administering sections 3 through 10 of this act. Fees shall be deposited in the industrial insurance trust funds.
