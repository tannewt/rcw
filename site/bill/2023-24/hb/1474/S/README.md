# HB 1474 - Covenant homeownership prg.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1474-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Generations of systemic, racist, and discriminatory policies and practices have created barriers to credit and homeownership for black, indigenous, and people of color and other historically marginalized communities in Washington state. The legislature finds that these policies and practices include redlining, racially restrictive covenants, mortgage subsidies and incentives, and displacement and gentrification.

    b. The state government was both an active and passive participant in this discrimination. For example, the legislature recognizes the role of state courts in facilitating discrimination by property owners; the existence of mandatory recording statutes that required county auditors to record racially restrictive covenants; the passage of the urban renewal law authorizing the designation, regulation, and displacement of certain neighborhoods that were deemed to be blighted; and state funding and regulation of the real estate and banking industries in ways that facilitated or promoted private discrimination. The legislature finds that the specific discriminatory acts and omissions are well documented, including in numerous public and private studies, reports, and other publications.

    c. This discrimination and its impacts continue to exist in the present day. The legislature recognizes that the homeownership rate for black, indigenous, and people of color and other historically marginalized communities in Washington is 19 percent below that of non-Hispanic white households, and the homeownership rate for black households is even lower. The legislature recognizes that credit, including home mortgages, is harder and more expensive to obtain for black, indigenous, and people of color and other historically marginalized communities in Washington than for non-Hispanic white households. The legislature finds that the imbalance in supply and demand in Washington's housing market has only exacerbated these inequities.

    d. These negative impacts extend beyond homeownership and affect wealth generation, housing security, and other outcomes for black, indigenous, and people of color and other historically marginalized communities in Washington. The legislature finds that these impacts include higher rates of homelessness, rent burdening, substandard or otherwise unhealthy or unsafe housing, and predatory and discriminatory lending practices that lead to further displacement and gentrification.

    e. Existing state and federal programs and other race-neutral approaches are insufficient to remedy that discrimination and its impacts on access to credit and homeownership for black, indigenous, and people of color and other historically marginalized communities in Washington. The legislature finds that race-conscious programs, such as the special purpose credit programs authorized by section 6 of this act, are necessary to remedy the past discrimination in which the state was complicit and to remove the structural barriers that persist.

2. The legislature declares that the state has a compelling interest in remedying past and ongoing discrimination and its impacts on access to credit and homeownership for black, indigenous, and people of color and other historically marginalized communities in Washington.

## Section 2
1. Beginning January 1, 2024, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the county auditor must collect a covenant homeownership program assessment of $100 for each document recorded, which is in addition to any other charge, surcharge, or assessment allowed by law. The county auditor may retain up to one percent of the moneys for collection of the assessment and must remit the remainder of the moneys to the state treasurer to be deposited in the covenant homeownership account created in section 4 of this act.

2. The assessment imposed in this section does not apply to: (a) Assignments or substitutions of previously recorded deeds of trust; (b) documents recording a birth, marriage, divorce, or death; (c) any recorded documents otherwise exempted from a recording fee or additional assessments under state law; (d) marriage licenses issued by the county auditor; or (e) documents recording a federal, state, county, city, or water-sewer district, or wage lien or satisfaction of lien.

## Section 3

For example, these unlawful restrictions commonly included exclusions against black, indigenous, and people of color and other historically marginalized communities in Washington state, using terms, many of which are offensive, such as "African blood" meaning all sub-Saharan African ancestries; "Aryan" meaning not Jewish, not eastern or southern European, nor any ancestry except northern European; "Asiatic" meaning all Asian ancestries; Chinese; "colored person" meaning all sub-Saharan African ancestries; "colored races" meaning all nonwhite races; "Ethiopian" meaning all sub-Saharan African ancestries; "gentile" meaning non-Jewish; Hawaiian; "Hebrew" meaning Jewish; "Hindu" meaning all South Asian ancestries; "Indian" meaning Native Americans and also possibly South Asian ancestries; Japanese; "Malay" meaning Filipino; "Mongolian" meaning all East Asian ancestries; "Negro blood" meaning all sub-Saharan African ancestries; "oriental" meaning all Asian ancestries; "Turkish empire" meaning all middle easterners; and "yellow races" meaning all Asian ancestries.

Sec. 1691 et seq.) as amended, allowing a creditor to extend special purpose credit to applicants who meet eligibility requirements under a credit assistance program expressly authorized by state law for the benefit of an economically disadvantaged class of persons.

The legislature may appropriate a portion of this one percent of moneys in the account to the department of financial institutions for costs related to the oversight committee created in section 7 of this act; and

2. The legislature may appropriate the remainder of the moneys in the account to the department to contract with the commission for the purposes of the program described in section 6 of this act.

        iv. Recommend program modifications and improvements.

If the covenant homeownership program study identifies an economically disadvantaged class or classes of persons that share one or more common characteristics such as, race, national origin, or sex and the board of the commission finds it necessary to consider this information in tailoring a special purpose credit program to provide credit assistance to economically disadvantaged classes of persons, the commission may consider these characteristics in designing and implementing the program.
