<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the practices of cosmetology, hair design, barbering, manicuring,  esthetics, and master esthetics involve the use of tools and chemicals which may be dangerous when mixed or applied improperly, and therefore finds it necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to regulate those practices in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further recognizes that the practice of permanent cosmetics, enhanced permanent cosmetics, and corrective enhanced permanent cosmetics involves invasive procedures using needles, sharps, and instruments. This practice may be dangerous when improper sterilization techniques are used, presenting a risk of infecting clients with blood-borne pathogens including, but not limited to, HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. It is in the interest of the state's public health, safety, and welfare to establish requirements in the commercial practice of this activity.</p>
