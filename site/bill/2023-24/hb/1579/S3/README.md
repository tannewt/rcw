## Section 1
The purpose of RCW 43.10.232 is to grant authority to the attorney general concurrent with the county prosecuting attorneys to investigate and prosecute crimes, including deaths from the use of deadly force by an involved officer as those terms are defined in RCW 43.102.010. The purpose of RCW 10.01.190 is to ensure access by the attorney general to the procedural powers of the various prosecuting attorneys in exercising criminal prosecutorial authority granted in RCW 43.10.232 or otherwise granted by the legislature.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. The attorney general shall have concurrent authority and power with the prosecuting attorneys to investigate crimes and initiate and conduct prosecutions :

        i. Upon the request of or with the concurrence of the county prosecuting attorney of the jurisdiction in which the offense has occurred;

        ii. Upon the request of or with the concurrence of the governor of the state of Washington; or

        iii. As provided in subsection (2) of this section.

    b. A request or concurrence shall be communicated in writing to the attorney general.

    c. Prior to any prosecution by the attorney general under (a) of this subsection, the attorney general and the county in which the offense occurred shall reach an agreement regarding the payment of all costs, including expert witness fees, and defense attorneys' fees associated with any such prosecution.

2. [Empty]

    a. The attorney general's office of independent prosecutions shall have concurrent authority and power with the prosecuting attorneys to review investigations and initiate and conduct prosecutions of applicable use of force cases, as defined in this chapter. "Prosecution" includes appeals and requests for postconviction relief.

    b. In any prosecution pursuant to this subsection, the attorney general's office of independent prosecutions may prosecute related offenses and defendants. Related offenses and defendants for purposes of this subsection are those offenses and defendants that may be joined in an information as provided by law or by the criminal rules for the superior courts of the state of Washington. Related offenses also include crimes arising from or discovered during the course of the use of force investigation when such crimes have a relationship to the use of force investigation or to a prosecution of the use of force incident.

    c. Nothing in this subsection affects the authority of the prosecuting attorney to conduct prosecutions of crimes committed by an individual who is the subject of the use of force action by the involved officer.

    d. The authority of the attorney general's office of independent prosecutions under this subsection applies to any applicable use of force case as defined in this chapter.

    e. The attorney general's office shall be responsible for its expert witness fees and other costs of prosecution associated with prosecutions it undertakes pursuant to this subsection. The attorney general's office shall not be responsible for defense costs, including defense attorneys' fees, defense expert witness fees, or any other cost related to the defense in a criminal prosecution brought pursuant to this subsection. Reimbursement for costs are subject to the provisions of RCW 9A.16.046. The county in which the action is filed shall be responsible for court administration costs and public defense costs if the defendant so qualifies.

## Section 3
1. If both a prosecuting attorney and the attorney general file an information or indictment charging a defendant with substantially the same offense(s), the court shall, upon motion of either the prosecuting attorney or the attorney general:

    a. Determine whose prosecution of the case will best promote the interests of justice and enter an order designating that person as the prosecuting authority in the case; and

    b. Enter an order dismissing the information or indictment filed by the person who was not designated the prosecuting authority.

2. For purposes of designating the prosecuting authority where information or an indictment has been filed by both the office of the attorney general pursuant to RCW 43.10.232(2) and the prosecuting attorney pursuant to RCW 36.27.020, the court shall, in accordance with section 4 of this act, prioritize the public's interest in ensuring a fair and impartial prosecution and trial that is free from bias or the appearance of bias, prejudice, or conflict of interest. In any judicial proceeding under this subsection, in order to be designated the prosecuting authority, the county prosecuting attorney must overcome a presumption that the county prosecuting attorney has an inherent conflict of interest in any applicable use of force case.

## Section 4
The legislature finds that the Washington state Constitution provides that the legislature shall prescribe the duties of both the attorney general and the county prosecuting attorneys. The legislature finds that the close working relationships and intertwined duties between local law enforcement and local prosecutors can give the appearance of bias in review of incidents of use of deadly force by Washington peace officers and corrections officers.

In order to increase public confidence in the fairness of review of investigations of incidents of use of deadly force by Washington peace officers and corrections officers, and to ensure independence and transparency in such reviews, the legislature finds it necessary to create an office of independent prosecutions within the attorney general's office. The legislature further finds that prosecutions by the independent prosecutor will best promote the interests of justice.

## Section 5

Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of independent prosecutions is hereby established within the office of the attorney general for the purpose of reviewing investigations of applicable use of force cases.

    b.
