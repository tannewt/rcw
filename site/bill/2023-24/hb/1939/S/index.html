<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven member states (&quot;charter member states&quot;) to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in section 14 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in section 11(3)(u) of this act to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.</p>

<li>
<p>All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission.</p>

<li>
<p>Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute.</p>

<p>This compact and the commission's rule-making authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the compact.

<p>The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the Constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.</p>

<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 14(2) of this act, terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the Constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.</p>
