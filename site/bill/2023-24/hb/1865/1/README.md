# HB 1865 - Modifying enforcement of motor vehicle liability insurance and fiscal responsibilities.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1865.pdf)

## Section 1
Many people have been victims of irresponsible drivers who damaged lives and property and also were uninsured, thus further aggravating the injury to the other person.  Washington requires drivers to have motor vehicle liability insurance or be sufficiently fiscally responsible to cover damages if the driver damages another person or property. The legislature intends to improve compliance with these requirements through modification of enforcement mechanisms. The changes in this act are intended to prevent repeat offenders and people who have damaged persons or property while driving from continuing to drive in violation of the law.

## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. No person may operate a motor vehicle subject to registration under chapter 46.16A RCW in this state unless the person is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy with liability limits of at least the amounts provided in RCW 46.29.090, is self-insured as provided in RCW 46.29.630, is covered by a certificate of deposit in conformance with RCW 46.29.550, or is covered by a liability bond of at least the amounts provided in RCW 46.29.090. Proof of financial responsibility for motor vehicle operation must be provided on the request of a law enforcement officer in the format specified under RCW 46.30.030.

    b. A person who drives a motor vehicle that is required to be registered in another state that requires drivers and owners of vehicles in that state to maintain insurance or financial responsibility shall, when requested by a law enforcement officer, provide evidence of financial responsibility or insurance as is required by the laws of the state in which the vehicle is registered.

    c. When asked to do so by a law enforcement officer, failure to display proof of financial responsibility for motor vehicle operation as specified under RCW 46.30.030 creates a presumption that the person does not have motor vehicle insurance.

    d. Failure to provide proof of motor vehicle insurance is a traffic infraction and is subject to penalties as set by the supreme court under RCW 46.63.110 or community restitution and a law enforcement officer is authorized to take steps to prevent a person from driving a vehicle in violation of (a) of this subsection as authorized by law.

    e. For the purposes of this section, when a person uses a portable electronic device to display proof of financial security to a law enforcement officer, the officer may only view the proof of financial security and is otherwise prohibited from viewing any other content on the portable electronic device.

    f. Whenever a person presents a portable electronic device pursuant to this section, that person assumes all liability for any damage to the portable electronic device.

2. [Empty]

    a. Whenever a law enforcement officer discovers that a person is driving a vehicle in violation of subsection (1)(a) of this section, the law enforcement officer has the discretion to take steps to prevent the person from continuing to drive in violation of subsection (1)(a) of this section when:

        i. The person has been given citations for a violation of this section at least twice in the prior three years; or

        ii. The person has been the cause of an accident that involves damage to another person or property while driving in violation of subsection (1)(a) of this section in the last three years.

    b. A law enforcement officer may detain the person and vehicle until a person with a valid driver's license and proof of motor vehicle liability insurance or financial responsibility arrives to drive the vehicle.

    c. A law enforcement officer may authorize the impoundment of the vehicle.

    d. If the driver of the vehicle has been given citations for a violation of this section at least twice in the prior three years and the driver has been the cause of an accident that involves damage to another person or property while driving in violation of subsection (1)(a) of this section, then the law enforcement officer must impound the vehicle.

3. If a person cited for a violation of subsection (1) of this section appears in person before the court or a violations bureau and provides written evidence that at the time the person was cited, he or she was in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of subsection (1) of this section, the citation shall be dismissed and the court or violations bureau may assess court administrative costs of $25 at the time of dismissal. In lieu of personal appearance, a person cited for a violation of subsection (1) of this section may, before the date scheduled for the person's appearance before the court or violations bureau, submit by mail to the court or violations bureau written evidence that at the time the person was cited, he or she was in compliance with the financial responsibility requirements of subsection (1) of this section, in which case the citation shall be dismissed without cost, except that the court or violations bureau may assess court administrative costs of $25 at the time of dismissal.

4. The provisions of this chapter shall not govern:

    a. The operation of a motor vehicle registered under RCW 46.18.220 or 46.18.255, governed by RCW 46.16A.170, or registered with the Washington utilities and transportation commission as common or contract carriers; or

5. RCW 46.29.490 shall not be deemed to govern all motor vehicle liability policies required by this chapter but only those certified for the purposes stated in chapter 46.29 RCW.
