<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the state of Washington is experiencing a significant increase in housing costs, particularly in rental markets. High rents have become a substantial burden for a substantial portion of the population, limiting their ability to access safe and affordable housing. This situation creates economic instability and negatively impacts the overall well-being of individuals and families across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that a significant number of Washington residents are currently rent-burdened, spending a disproportionate amount of their income on housing expenses. The strain imposed by high rental costs contributes to financial insecurity, making it challenging for individuals and families to meet other essential needs, such as health care, education, and savings for the future. This phenomenon exacerbates existing inequalities and hinders economic mobility for a significant portion of the population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to address the issue of housing affordability by establishing a rental voucher program. This program aims to reduce the number of people who are rent-burdened by providing financial assistance to eligible individuals and families. This program seeks to create a more equitable and accessible housing market, fostering stability and opportunity for Washington residents. By implementing this rental voucher program, the legislature aims to alleviate the economic strain caused by high rents, promote housing security, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents of the state.</p>
