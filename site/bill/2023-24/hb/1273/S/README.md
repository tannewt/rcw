# HB 1273 - High school and beyond plans

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1273-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that promoting career awareness, exploration, and preparation is important for all students as they progress through their educational experiences. This promotion is consistent with ongoing legislative efforts to create an education system focused on individualized student learning that is relevant and culturally responsive to Washington's diverse student population, and empowers students to make progress towards their own education and career goals.

2. The legislature finds also that the promotion of a consistent and equitable continuum of career development supports is fostered by a system that helps to guide each student's career and college exploration and preparation efforts. This system should include access to an online course and goal planning platform that allows each student to work with teachers, parents or guardians, school counselors, and other adults who support their academic progress and career development. This platform should allow students, in partnership with these supportive adults, to develop meaningful high school and beyond plans that promote the attainment of their career and college goals.

3. The legislature recognizes the need for a uniform, online high school and beyond plan platform that enables students and others to understand the steps needed to meet graduation requirements and to prepare for postsecondary education and training. A statewide high school and beyond plan platform can also ensure that qualified adults who support students can have access to applicable information as they guide students' high school experiences and assist in preparing students for postsecondary education or training and career engagement.

4. The legislature, therefore, intends to revise and strengthen high school and beyond plan requirements and to direct the office of the superintendent of public instruction to facilitate the transition to and adoption of a statewide online platform for high school and beyond plans to guide students' secondary education experiences and ensure preparation for their postsecondary plans.

## Section 2
1. The state board of education shall establish high school graduation requirements or equivalencies for students, except as provided in RCW 28A.230.122 and 28A.655.250 and except those equivalencies established by local high schools or school districts under RCW 28A.230.097. The purpose of a high school diploma is to declare that a student is ready for success in postsecondary education, gainful employment, and citizenship, and is equipped with the skills to be a lifelong learner.

    a. Any course in Washington state history and government used to fulfill high school graduation requirements shall consider including information on the culture, history, and government of the American Indian peoples who were the first inhabitants of the state.

    b. Except as provided otherwise in this subsection, the certificate of academic achievement requirements under RCW 28A.655.061 or the certificate of individual achievement requirements under RCW 28A.155.045 are required for graduation from a public high school but are not the only requirements for graduation. The requirement to earn a certificate of academic achievement to qualify for graduation from a public high school concludes with the graduating class of 2019. The obligation of qualifying students to earn a certificate of individual achievement as a prerequisite for graduation from a public high school concludes with the graduating class of 2021.

    c. Each student must have a high school and beyond plan to guide the student's high school experience and inform course taking that is aligned with the student's goals for education or training and career after high school

that meets the requirements established in section 3 of this act.

    d. [Empty]

        i. The state board of education shall adopt rules to implement the career and college ready graduation requirement proposal adopted under board resolution on November 10, 2010, and revised on January 9, 2014, to take effect beginning with the graduating class of 2019 or as otherwise provided in this subsection (1)(d). The rules must include authorization for a school district to waive up to two credits for individual students based on a student's circumstances, provided that none of the waived credits are identified as mandatory core credits by the state board of education. School districts must adhere to written policies authorizing the waivers that must be adopted by each board of directors of a school district that grants diplomas. The rules must also provide that the content of the third credit of mathematics and the content of the third credit of science may be chosen by the student based on the student's interests and high school and beyond plan with agreement of the student's parent or guardian or agreement of the school counselor or principal, or as provided in RCW 28A.230.300(4).

        ii. School districts may apply to the state board of education for a waiver to implement the career and college ready graduation requirement proposal beginning with the graduating class of 2020 or 2021 instead of the graduating class of 2019. In the application, a school district must describe why the waiver is being requested, the specific impediments preventing timely implementation, and efforts that will be taken to achieve implementation with the graduating class proposed under the waiver. The state board of education shall grant a waiver under this subsection (1)(d) to an applying school district at the next subsequent meeting of the board after receiving an application.

2. [Empty]

    a. In recognition of the statutory authority of the state board of education to establish and enforce minimum high school graduation requirements, the state board shall periodically reevaluate the graduation requirements and shall report such findings to the legislature in a timely manner as determined by the state board.

    b. The state board shall reevaluate the graduation requirements for students enrolled in vocationally intensive and rigorous career and technical education programs, particularly those programs that lead to a certificate or credential that is state or nationally recognized. The purpose of the evaluation is to ensure that students enrolled in these programs have sufficient opportunity to  complete the program and earn the program's certificate or credential, and complete other state and local graduation requirements.

    c. The state board shall forward any proposed changes to the high school graduation requirements to the education committees of the legislature for review. The legislature shall have the opportunity to act during a regular legislative session before the changes are adopted through administrative rule by the state board. Changes that have a fiscal impact on school districts, as identified by a fiscal analysis prepared by the office of the superintendent of public instruction, shall take effect only if formally authorized and funded by the legislature through the omnibus appropriations act or other enacted legislation.

    d. The state board of education may not require students to complete a culminating project as a graduation prerequisite.

3. Pursuant to any requirement for instruction in languages other than English established by the state board of education or a local school district, or both, for purposes of high school graduation, students who receive instruction in American sign language or one or more American Indian languages shall be considered to have satisfied the state or local school district graduation requirement for instruction in one or more languages other than English.

4. Unless requested otherwise by the student and the student's family, a student who has completed high school courses before attending high school shall be given high school credit which shall be applied to fulfilling high school graduation requirements if:

    a. The course was taken with high school students, if the academic level of the course exceeds the requirements for seventh and eighth grade classes, and the student has successfully passed by completing the same course requirements and examinations as the high school students enrolled in the class; or

    b. The academic level of the course exceeds the requirements for seventh and eighth grade classes and the course would qualify for high school credit, because the course is similar or equivalent to a course offered at a high school in the district as determined by the school district board of directors.

5. Students who have taken and successfully completed high school courses under the circumstances in subsection (4) of this section shall not be required to take an additional competency examination or perform any other additional assignment to receive credit.

6. At the college or university level, five quarter or three semester hours equals one high school credit.

The plan must be provided to the student and the students' parents or legal guardians in a language the student and parents or legal guardians understand.

5. School districts must annually provide students in grades eight through 12 and their parents or legal guardians with comprehensive information about the graduation pathway options offered by the district and are strongly encouraged to begin providing this information to students in grade six.

6. School districts are strongly encouraged to partner with student serving community-based organizations that support career exploration and preparation for postsecondary and career pathways. These partnerships may include high school and beyond plan coordination and planning, data-sharing agreements, and secure access to individual student high school and beyond plans.

7. All high school and beyond plans must, at a minimum, include the following elements:

10. The state board of education shall adopt and revise rules as necessary to implement this section.

## Section 4
1. The legislature finds that fully realizing the potential of high school and beyond plans as meaningful tools for articulating and revising pathways for graduation will require additional school counselors and family coordinators. The legislature further finds that the development and implementation of an online electronic platform for high school and beyond plans will be an appropriate and supportive action that will assist students, parents and guardians, educators, school counselors, and other staff who support students' career and college preparation as the legislature explores options for funding additional school counselors.
