<p>Prior to permitting a driver training school to use school property under this section, the board of directors must determine the terms and conditions required for the use of the school property, including ensuring that the driver training school is licensed under chapter 46.82 RCW to teach the classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction portions of a driver training education course, and that the instructors are licensed under RCW 46.82.320. Terms and conditions required by this subsection (2) may permit the use or lease of the school property at reduced or no cost.</p>
