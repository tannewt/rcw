[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1859.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that :

    a. Long-term care facilities are a critical part of the state's long-term care services system

;

    b. Choice, participation, privacy, and the opportunity to engage in religious, political, civic, recreational, and other social activities foster a sense of self-worth and enhance the quality of life for long-term care residents

;

    c. All residents of long-term care facilities are entitled to a safe, clean, comfortable, and homelike environment;

    d. The public interest is best served by providing the same  resident rights in all long-term care settings;

    e. Residents who reside in long-term care facilities are vulnerable adults as described in chapter 74.34 RCW and should be afforded the same protections;

    f. In addition to state resident rights, residents in nursing facilities are guaranteed certain rights by federal law and regulation, 42 U.S.C. 1396r and 42 C.F.R. Part 483; and

    g. Inequities have developed within the long-term care system and residents currently have different rights across all settings which leads to confusion and trauma for residents, providers, and regulators.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to :

    a. Assure that individuals who reside in long-term care facilities receive appropriate services, be treated with courtesy, continue to enjoy their basic civil and legal rights, and have the opportunity to exercise reasonable control over life decisions;

    b. Extend the rights of residents of nursing homes to residents in veterans' homes, assisted living facilities, enhanced services facilities, and adult family homes

; and

    c. Assure that facilities care for their residents in a manner and in an environment that promotes maintenance or enhancement of each resident's quality of life, including having a safe, clean, comfortable, and homelike environment, as well as allowing the resident to use  personal belongings to the extent possible.
