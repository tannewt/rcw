</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the delivery of nonemergency services, a provider-based clinic that charges a facility fee shall provide a notice to any patient that the clinic is licensed as part of the hospital and the patient may receive a separate charge or billing for the facility component, which may result in a higher out-of-pocket expense. The notice must include the amount of the facility fee that will be charged. The notice must be provided to a patient at the time the appointment is scheduled and at the time that the health care service is rendered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each provider-based clinic that charges a facility fee must post prominently in locations easily accessible to and visible by patients, including its website, a statement that the provider-based clinic is licensed as part of the hospital and the patient may receive a separate charge or billing for the facility, which may result in a higher out-of-pocket expense.</p>

<p>Beginning January 1, 2025, each initial billing statement that includes a facility fee must:</p>

<li>
<p>Clearly identify the fee as a facility fee that is billed in addition to, or separately from, any professional fee billed by the provider;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a statement that the facility fee is intended to cover the hospital's or health system's operational expenses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform the patient that the patient's financial liability may have been less if the services had been provided at a facility not owned or operated by the hospital or health system; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include written notice of the patient's right to request a reduction in the facility fee or any other portion of the bill and a telephone number that the patient may use to request such a reduction without regard to whether the patient qualifies for, or is likely to be granted, any reduction.</p>

The provider-based clinic's unique national provider identifier must be included on any claim for reimbursement or payment for health care services provided at the provider-based clinic, regardless of whether the claim is filed or submitted by or through a central office of the hospital.</p>
