## Section 1
1. The final decision of an administrative agency in an adjudicative proceeding under this chapter may be directly reviewed by the court of appeals either (a) upon certification by the superior court pursuant to this section or (b) if the final decision is from an environmental board as identified in RCW 43.21B.005 and the final decision relates to a clean energy project as defined in RCW 43.158.010, pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. Transfer of a case pursuant to subsection (3) of this section does not require the filing of a motion for discretionary review with the court of appeals.

2. [Empty]

    a. For direct review upon certification by the superior court, an application for direct review must be filed with the superior court within thirty days of the filing of the petition for review in superior court. The superior court may certify a case for direct review only if the judicial review is limited to the record of the agency proceeding and the court finds that:

        i. Fundamental and urgent issues affecting the future administrative process or the public interest are involved which require a prompt determination;

        ii. Delay in obtaining a final and prompt determination of such issues would be detrimental to any party or the public interest;

        iii. An appeal to the court of appeals would be likely regardless of the determination in superior court; and

        iv. The appellate court's determination in the proceeding would have significant precedential value.

    b. Procedures for certification shall be established by court rule.

3. [Empty]

    a. For the

appeal of a permit related to a clean energy project, as defined in RCW 43.158.010, that is the subject of a final adjudicative decision of an environmental board, as identified in RCW 43.21B.005, upon a motion filed by any party to the appeal, the superior court may certify a case for transfer to the court of appeals upon a finding that:

        i. The judicial review can occur based upon the agency record developed before the administrative body without supplementing the record pursuant to RCW 34.05.562; or

        ii. The superior court has completed any necessary supplementation of the record pursuant to RCW 34.05.562.

    b. If the superior court certifies a final decision of an administrative agency in an adjudicative proceeding, the superior court shall transfer the matter to the court of appeals as a direct appeal.

    c. A party contesting a superior court decision granting or denying certification for direct review may file a motion for discretionary review with the court of appeals. Where a contesting party demonstrates that substantial prejudice would result from direct review by the court of appeals, the court of appeals may remand to superior court.

## Section 2
1. Where multiple permits for the same underlying project are appealed to one or more of the environmental boards, as identified in RCW 43.21B.005, the presiding officer shall consolidate the appeals for hearing when one or more of the following criteria are met:

    a. Upon the consent of the parties; or

    b. When appeals for the permits related to the same underlying project are either:

        i. Filed within 60 days of each other; or

        ii. If the permits are not filed within 60 days of each other, the environmental board issues a stay of the appeal of the permit at the applicant's request, which must include a stay of the construction of the project pending appeal, to allow other anticipated appeals of permits for the same underlying project to be filed with the environmental boards to accommodate consolidation pursuant to this section; or

    c. The presiding officer determines that the following three criteria have been met:

        i. Consolidation will expedite disposition of the appeals;

        ii. Consolidation will avoid duplication of testimony; and

        iii. Consolidation will not prejudice the rights of the parties.

2. When all appeals of individual permits consolidated pursuant to this section are within the jurisdiction of the pollution control hearings board, the pollution control hearings board shall retain jurisdiction over the consolidated matter. When appeals to the pollution control hearings board and appeals to the shorelines hearings board are consolidated pursuant to this section, the following applies:

    a. The consolidated appeals must be heard by the shorelines hearings board;

    b. The deadline for decision in RCW 90.58.180(3) must be extended to 240 days and must be measured from the date that the last of the consolidated appeals was filed; and

    c. The time period in (b) of this subsection may be extended on motion from a party or by the board upon a showing that the consolidated appeal raises issues of unique complexity and that delay is not against the public interest. In no case may the time period in (b) of this subsection be extended for a period greater than 30 days unless the time period is waived by all parties.

## Section 3
1. [Empty]

    a. Any person aggrieved by the granting, denying, or rescinding of a permit on shorelines of the state pursuant to RCW 90.58.140 may seek review from the shorelines hearings board by filing a petition for review within 21 days of the date of filing of the decision as defined in RCW 90.58.140(6).

3. The review proceedings authorized in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are subject to the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW pertaining to procedures in adjudicative proceedings. Judicial review of such proceedings of the shorelines hearings board is governed by chapter 34.05 RCW. The board shall issue its decision on the appeal authorized under subsections (1) and (2) of this section within 180 days after the date the petition is filed with the board or a petition to intervene is filed by the department or the attorney general, whichever is later. The time period may be extended by the board for a period of 30 days upon a showing of good cause or may be waived by the parties.

4. Any person may appeal any rules, regulations, or guidelines adopted or approved by the department within 30 days of the date of the adoption or approval. The board shall make a final decision within 60 days following the hearing held thereon.

5. The board shall find the rule, regulation, or guideline to be valid and enter a final decision to that effect unless it determines that the rule, regulation, or guideline:

    b. Constitutes an implementation of this chapter in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; or

    c. Is arbitrary and capricious; or

    d. Was developed without fully considering and evaluating all material submitted to the department during public review and comment; or

    e. Was not adopted in accordance with required procedures.

If the board makes a determination under subsection (5)(a) through (e) of this section, it shall enter a final decision declaring the rule, regulation, or guideline invalid, remanding the rule, regulation, or guideline to the department with a statement of the reasons in support of the determination, and directing the department to adopt, after a thorough consultation with the affected local government and any other interested party, a new rule, regulation, or guideline consistent with the board's decision.

7. A decision of the board on the validity of a rule, regulation, or guideline shall be subject to review in superior court, if authorized pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW. A petition for review of the decision of the shorelines hearings board on a rule, regulation, or guideline shall be filed within 30 days after the date of final decision by the shorelines hearings board.

8. Where multiple permits for the same underlying project have been appealed to one or more of the environmental boards, as identified in RCW 43.21B.005, the presiding officer of the pollution control hearings board shall consolidate the appeals, including appeals to the shorelines hearings board, pursuant to section 2 of this act.
