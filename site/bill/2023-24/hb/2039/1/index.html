<p>The final decision of an administrative agency in an adjudicative proceeding under this chapter may be directly reviewed by the court of appeals either (a) upon certification by the superior court pursuant to this section or (b) if the final decision is from an environmental board as defined in subsection (3) of this section, upon acceptance by the court of appeals after a certificate of appealability has been filed by the environmental board that rendered the final decision.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For direct review upon certification by the superior court, an application for direct review must be filed with the superior court within thirty days of the filing of the petition for review in superior court. The superior court may certify a case for direct review only if the judicial review is limited to the record of the agency proceeding and the court finds that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Fundamental and urgent issues affecting the future administrative process or the public interest are involved which require a prompt determination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delay in obtaining a final and prompt determination of such issues would be detrimental to any party or the public interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An appeal to the court of appeals would be likely regardless of the determination in superior court; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appellate court's determination in the proceeding would have significant precedential value.</p>

<p>The final decision of an environmental board in an adjudicative proceeding under this chapter may be directly reviewed by the court of appeals upon certification by the superior court pursuant to this subsection. Transfer of cases pursuant to this section does not require the filing of a motion for discretionary review with the court of appeals.</p>
<pre><code>c. The superior court may certify cases for transfer to the court of appeals upon finding that transfer would serve the interest of justice, would not cause substantial prejudice to any party, including any unrepresented party, and further finds that:

    i. The judicial review can occur based upon the agency record developed before the administrative body without supplementing the record pursuant to RCW 34.05.562; or

    ii. The superior court has completed any necessary supplementation of the record pursuant to RCW 34.05.562, such that only issues of law remain for determination.

d. If the superior court certifies a final decision of an administrative agency in an adjudicative proceeding, the superior court shall transfer the matter to the court of appeals as a direct appeal.

e. A party contesting a superior court decision granting or denying certification for direct review may file a motion for discretionary review with the court of appeals.

<p>The superior court may transfer the judicial review of a land use decision to the court of appeals upon finding that transfer would serve the interest of justice, that transfer would not cause substantial prejudice to any party, including any unrepresented party, and that the judicial review can occur based upon an existing record. Transfer of cases pursuant to this section does not require the filing of a motion for discretionary review with the court of appeals.</p>
