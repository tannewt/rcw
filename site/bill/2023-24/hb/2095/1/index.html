<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends that consumers have the option to collect balances on abandoned gift certificates either directly through the retailer or through Washington's unclaimed property program. Washington's unclaimed property program is a free public service that returned over $100,000,000 in property to rightful owners in fiscal year 2023. The legislature finds that giving consumers the option to collect balances from abandoned gift certificates through unclaimed property will reduce the incentive for large companies to adopt predatory or deceptive practices regarding gift certificate usage because companies must escheat abandoned gift certificate balances while they remain unspent and, therefore, will not be able to keep revenue from unspent gift certificates. The legislature intends to exempt small businesses from the requirements for reporting gift certificates as unclaimed property. The legislature finds that funds for the unclaimed property account are tracked by the Washington state economic and revenue forecast council and are part of state nontax sources that provide funding for state government and its existing institutions. In order to protect consumers, the legislature intends to prohibit acts and practices of retailers that deprive consumers of the full value of gift certificates, such as expiration dates, service fees, and dormancy and inactivity charges, on gift certificates. The legislature does not intend that this chapter  be construed to apply to cards or other payment instruments issued for payment of wages or other intangible property. To that end, the legislature intends that this chapter  should be liberally construed to benefit consumers and that any ambiguities should be resolved by applying the revised uniform unclaimed property act to the intangible property in question.</p>
