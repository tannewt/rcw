<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the lack of housing affordability and related instances of homelessness are issues that affect every community in Washington. The legislature also finds that increased homelessness is overwhelmingly caused by rising rents, which push people living at the margins into homelessness, erode public confidence, and undermine the shared values that have driven our state's prosperity. The legislature further finds that problems caused by rent increases are exacerbated by the associated issue of very low vacancy rates, which make it difficult for people to find a unit even when they have sufficient income or rental assistance to pay market rates. The legislature finds that low housing vacancy rates, the growth in population, and limited housing supply have created a housing shortage in which existing inventory is priced at a premium. The legislature also finds that although household incomes have grown along with the economy, income increase for those with moderate and lower incomes have not kept pace with rent and purchase price increases. This problem is especially impacting lower and fixed income households, including seniors, veterans, farmworkers, and people with disabilities. Indeed, these trends, in combination with other market factors, have created a deficit of housing that is affordable and available, particularly for Washingtonians within the low to middle income range who are increasingly more vulnerable to homelessness. Moreover, the legislature finds that these households have the fewest options available in the private housing market. In strong housing markets, builders seek the highest achievable price to offset higher development costs, which means new production does not create more housing that is affordable.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that having a home is a basic need and fundamental for Washington residents, and that all Washingtonians should be able to afford safe and dependable housing with access to opportunities such as education, employment, transit, and amenities. The legislature finds that housing that is affordable is an essential part of every community's infrastructure, serving as a platform for individuals and families to stabilize, build their economic futures, and thrive. Housing serves as a platform for better health and creates jobs and attracts investment, making it a prerequisite to economic growth and stronger communities. In addition, the legislature finds that a variety of housing types is needed to provide affordable options for families of all sizes and stages of life. Furthermore, the legislature finds that increasing the supply of permanently affordable housing, getting residents back into housing, and reducing homelessness is a priority of the people of Washington state and that reducing homelessness lessens fiscal impact to the state and improves the economic vitality of our businesses.</p>
<p>Moreover, the legislature finds that the private real estate market does not provide adequate housing options affordable for all economic segments, and therefore government assistance is needed to offer the full range of affordable housing options.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington has the most regressive tax code in the nation, with low-income families paying six times more in taxes, as a share of their income, than the wealthiest individuals in the state. This means lower-income and middle-income families shoulder an inequitable amount of the responsibility of funding critical community investments and resources.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to increase the supply of housing that is affordable through a permanent, dedicated investment in the Washington housing trust fund, and related housing programs, for Washington residents in the low-income to middle-income range while reducing their tax burden and ensuring Washington's most wealthy share more equitably in the responsibility of funding the essential need of affordable housing in our communities.</p>

The term also includes the grant, assignment, quitclaim, sale, or transfer of improvements constructed upon leased land.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The term &quot;sale&quot; also includes the transfer or acquisition within any 36 month period of a controlling interest in any entity with an interest in real property located in this state for a valuable consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the sole purpose of determining whether, pursuant to the exercise of an option, a controlling interest was transferred or acquired within a 36 month period, the date that the option agreement was executed is the date on which the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest is deemed to occur. For all other purposes under this chapter, the date upon which the option is exercised is the date of the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest.</p>

<p>For purposes of this subsection, all acquisitions of persons acting in concert must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest has taken place. The department must adopt standards by rule to determine when persons are acting in concert. In adopting a rule for this purpose, the department must consider the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Persons must be treated as acting in concert when they have a relationship with each other such that one person influences or controls the actions of another through common ownership; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When persons are not commonly owned or controlled, they must be treated as acting in concert only when the unity with which the purchasers have negotiated and will consummate the transfer of ownership interests supports a finding that they are acting as a single entity. If the acquisitions are completely independent, with each purchaser buying without regard to the identity of the other purchasers, then the acquisitions are considered separate acquisitions.</p>

<p>As used in this chapter, the term &quot;sale&quot; has its ordinary meaning and includes any conveyance, grant, assignment, quitclaim, or transfer of the ownership of or title to real property, including standing timber, or any estate or interest therein for a valuable consideration, and any contract for such conveyance, grant, assignment, quitclaim, or transfer, and any lease with an option to purchase real property, including standing timber, or any estate or interest therein or other contract under which possession of the property is given to the purchaser, or any other person at the purchaser's direction, and title to the property is retained by the vendor as security for the payment of the purchase price.

<p>The term &quot;sale&quot; also includes the transfer or acquisition within any 36 month period of a controlling interest in any entity with an interest in real property located in this state for a valuable consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the sole purpose of determining whether, pursuant to the exercise of an option, a controlling interest was transferred or acquired within a 36 month period, the date that the option agreement was executed is the date on which the transfer or acquisition of the controlling interest is deemed to occur.

<p>For purposes of this subsection, all acquisitions of persons acting in concert must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest has taken place. The department must adopt standards by rule to determine when persons are acting in concert. In adopting a rule for this purpose, the department must consider the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Persons must be treated as acting in concert when they have a relationship with each other such that one person influences or controls the actions of another through common ownership; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When persons are not commonly owned or controlled, they must be treated as acting in concert only when the unity with which the purchasers have negotiated and will consummate the transfer of ownership interests supports a finding that they are acting as a single entity. If the acquisitions are completely independent, with each purchaser buying without regard to the identity of the other purchasers, then the acquisitions are considered separate acquisitions.</p>
