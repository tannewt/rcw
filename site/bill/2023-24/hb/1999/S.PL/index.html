<li>
<p>In a prosecution under RCW 9.68A.040, it is not a defense that the defendant was involved in activities of law enforcement and prosecution agencies in the investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses. Law enforcement and prosecution agencies shall not employ minors to aid in the investigation of a violation of RCW 9.68A.090 or 9.68A.100 through 9.68A.102, except for the purpose of facilitating an investigation where the minor is also the alleged victim and the:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In a prosecution under RCW 9.68A.050, 9.68A.060, 9.68A.070, or 9.68A.075, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant was a law enforcement officer or a person specifically authorized, in writing, to assist a law enforcement officer and acting at the direction of a law enforcement officer in the process of conducting an official investigation of a sex-related crime against a minor, or that the defendant was providing individual case treatment as a recognized medical facility or as a psychiatrist or psychologist licensed under Title 18 RCW.

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In any criminal proceeding, any property or material that constitutes a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, including any fabricated depictions, shall remain in the care, custody, and control of either a law enforcement agency or the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite any request by the defendant or prosecution, any property or material that constitutes a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, including any fabricated depictions, shall not be copied, photographed, duplicated, or otherwise reproduced, so long as the property or material is made reasonably available to the parties. Such property or material shall be deemed to be reasonably available to the parties if the prosecution, defense counsel, or any individual sought to be qualified to furnish expert testimony at trial has ample opportunity for inspection, viewing, and examination of the property or material at a law enforcement facility or a neutral facility approved by the court upon petition by the defense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant may view and examine the property and materials only while in the presence of his or her attorney. If the defendant is proceeding pro se, the court will appoint an individual to supervise the defendant while he or she examines the materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may direct that a mirror image of a computer hard drive containing such depictions be produced for use by an expert only upon a showing that an expert has been retained and is prepared to conduct a forensic examination while the mirror imaged hard drive remains in the care, custody, and control of a law enforcement agency or the court. Upon a substantial showing that the expert's analysis cannot be accomplished while the mirror imaged hard drive is kept within the care, custody, and control of a law enforcement agency or the court, the court may order its release to the expert for analysis for a limited time. If release is granted, the court shall issue a protective order setting forth such terms and conditions as are necessary to protect the rights of the victims, to document the chain of custody, and to protect physical evidence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, regardless of its format and whether it is a fabricated depiction, is marked as an exhibit in a criminal proceeding, the prosecutor shall seek an order sealing the exhibit at the close of the trial. Any exhibits sealed under this section shall be sealed with evidence tape in a manner that prevents access to, or viewing of, the depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct and shall be labeled so as to identify its contents. Anyone seeking to view such an exhibit must obtain permission from the superior court after providing at least ten days notice to the prosecuting attorney. Appellate attorneys for the defendant and the state shall be given access to the exhibit, which must remain in the care and custody of either a law enforcement agency or the court. Any other person moving to view such an exhibit must demonstrate to the court that his or her reason for viewing the exhibit is of sufficient importance to justify another violation of the victim's privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever the clerk of the court receives an exhibit of a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, he or she shall store the exhibit in a secure location, such as a safe. The clerk may arrange for the transfer of such exhibits to a law enforcement agency evidence room for safekeeping provided the agency agrees not to destroy or dispose of the exhibits without an order of the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the criminal proceeding ends in a conviction, the clerk of the court shall destroy any exhibit containing a depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, including any fabricated depictions, five years after the judgment is final, as determined by the provisions of RCW 10.73.090(3). Before any destruction, the clerk shall contact the prosecuting attorney and verify that there is no collateral attack on the judgment pending in any court. If the criminal proceeding ends in a mistrial, the clerk shall either maintain the exhibit or return it to the law enforcement agency that investigated the criminal charges for safekeeping until the matter is set for retrial. If the criminal proceeding ends in an acquittal, the clerk shall return the exhibit to the law enforcement agency that investigated the criminal charges for either safekeeping or destruction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, in any format and including any fabricated depictions, distributed as discovery to defense counsel or an expert witness prior to June 7, 2012, shall either be returned to the law enforcement agency that investigated the criminal charges or destroyed, if the case is no longer pending in superior court. If the case is still pending, the depiction shall be returned to the superior court judge assigned to the case or the presiding judge. The court shall order either the destruction of the depiction or the safekeeping of the depiction if it will be used at trial.</p>
<p>It is not a defense to violations of this chapter for crimes committed after December 31, 2012, that the initial receipt of the depictions was done under the color of law through the discovery process.</p>
