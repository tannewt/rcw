<p>The legislature finds communities and individuals would benefit from improved coordination and collaboration between provider organizations delivering services to prevent and respond to homelessness. The legislature intends to encourage coordination and collaboration between provider organizations to improve outcomes and foster integrated systems of services.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A state agency may not award a state contract to a qualifying local provider for the provision of housing and services for persons at risk of or experiencing homelessness in a given county if any state agency awarded that qualifying local provider a state contract for the prior fiscal year for the provision of housing and services for persons at risk of or experiencing homelessness in a given county and the qualifying local provider was both subject to and failed to comply with the requirements under section 2 of this act.</p>
