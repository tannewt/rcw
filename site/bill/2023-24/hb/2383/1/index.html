<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dependency courts should work to ensure the well-being of dependent children and to ensure that every young person who leaves foster care has relational permanency – meaning they have various long-term relationships that help them feel loved and connected. This includes relationships with siblings, parents, family members, extended family, family friends, mentors, and where appropriate, former foster family members.</p>
<p>Legal permanency, achieved through reunification, guardianship, or adoption is important, but it is not the only way to provide a sense of belonging and meaningful connections for young people. The federal children's bureau has cautioned that, legal permanence alone does not guarantee secure attachments and lifelong relationships. The relational aspects of permanency are critically important and fundamental to overall well-being, administration on children, youth and families, information memorandum ACYF-CB-IM-20-09, January 5, 2021. Relational permanency is one component of a child's overall well-being. Washington state's data collection should reflect the importance of both relational and legal permanency as well as child well-being.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The administrative office of the courts, in consultation with the attorney general's office and the department, shall compile an annual report, providing information about dependency cases including available data about whether children in Washington state dependency cases are achieving relational permanency, whether cases meet statutory guidelines, and reasons why timelines are not met.</p>
