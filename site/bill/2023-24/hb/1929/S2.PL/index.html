<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature has committed to and invested in ensuring that young people exiting the system of care do so with safe housing and developmentally responsive services through the enactment of Substitute Senate Bill No. 6560 (2018) and Second Substitute House Bill No. 1905 (2022).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that young people who exit behavioral health inpatient treatment are the largest group of people who become homeless within three to 12 months of all the young people who exit any publicly funded system of care, as identified in a 2023 report produced by the research and data analysis division of the department of social and health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature has invested significant funding in the behavioral health system and finds that ensuring a person's safe return to the community postinpatient treatment is a high priority and a major opportunity to end their experience with homelessness. In addition, the legislature finds that a young person who enters treatment demonstrates the courage to engage in their personal health and creates the opportunity for family and community reunification, career development, and a full life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that it often takes more time and resources than expected during a person's inpatient treatment episode to identify a return to community plan that includes long-term, safe housing and a developmentally and culturally responsive support system that includes relationships, services, and passions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For these reasons, the legislature finds that having an interim housing option that provides a safe and soft landing postinpatient treatment, located on each side of the state, that has well-trained staff and peers who have behavioral health expertise, is a sound investment in our young people and our collective goals to prevent and end homelessness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
