<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that it is the public policy of this state to provide the maximum access to reproductive health care for all people in Washington. Reproductive health care is the care necessary to support the reproductive system, the capability to reproduce, and the freedom and services necessary to decide if, when, and how often to do so. In 2022, the Dobbs decision removed federal protections for reproductive freedom, opening the doors for states to enact draconian laws that would limit an individual's access to reproductive services, including not only the ability to terminate a pregnancy but also the ability to access assisted reproductive services such as in-vitro fertilization. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to preserve and protect these services in Washington.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of this code and any legislation hereafter enacted by the legislature or by the people, any fertilized human egg or human embryo that exists in any form outside of the uterus of a human body shall not, under any circumstances, be considered an unborn child, a minor child, a natural person, or any other term that connotes a human being for any purpose under state law.</p>
