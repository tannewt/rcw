# HB 2263 - Assisted living facilities

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2263.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that older adults in need of long-term services and supports are impacted by the housing affordability and homelessness crisis. Particularly, but not exclusively, adults over the age of 65 with fixed, lower incomes and behavioral health and other underlying medical issues are at greatest risk for serious health consequences if housing situations become unstable. Recognizing the interplay between health and housing, the legislature intends to facilitate the incorporation of additional support services within certain existing long-term care settings to provide a harmonious blend of both long-term care assistance and permanent supportive housing within the same facility. This strategic approach aims to:

1. Encourage the delivery of holistic care that considers both clinical and supportive services essential for improving health outcomes and quality of life for medicaid beneficiaries;

2. Foster a seamless integration of services that is responsive to the evolving needs of medicaid beneficiaries residing in certain long-term care settings thereby reducing the likelihood of institutionalization and unnecessary hospitalizations; and

3. Ensure fiscal sustainability by leveraging existing resources, preventing duplicative services, and promoting efficiencies in care coordination.

## Section 12
1. The department shall establish in rule a new medicaid payment system for contracted assisted living, adult residential care, and enhanced adult residential care. Beginning July 1, 2019, payments for these contracts must be based on the new methodology which must be phased-in to full implementation according to funding made available by the legislature for this purpose. The new payment system must have these components: Client care, operations,  room and board, and supportive housing services.

2. Client care is the labor component of the system and must include variables to recognize the time and intensity of client care and services, staff wages, and associated fringe benefits. The wage variable in the client care component must be adjusted according to service areas based on labor costs. For the purposes of this subsection, client care does not include costs associated with supportive housing services.

    a. The time variable is used to weight the client care payment to client acuity and must be scaled according to the classification levels utilized in the department's assessment tool. The initial system shall establish a variable for time using the residential care time study conducted in 2001 and the department's corresponding estimate of the average staff hours per client by job position.

    b. The wage variable shall include recognition of staff positions needed to perform the functions required by contract, including nursing services. Data used to establish the wage variable must be adjusted so that no baseline wage is below the state minimum in effect at the time of implementation. The wage variable is a blended wage based on the federal bureau of labor statistics wage data and the distribution of time according to staff position. Blended wages are established for each county and then counties are arrayed from highest to lowest. Service areas are established and the median blended wage in each service area becomes the wage variable for all the assigned counties in that service area. The system must have no less than two service areas, one of which shall be a high labor cost service area and shall include counties at or above the ninety-fifth percentile in the array of blended wages.

    c. The fringe benefit variable recognizes employee benefits and payroll taxes. The factor to calculate the percentage of fringe benefits shall be established using the statewide nursing facility cost ratio of benefits and payroll taxes to in-house wages.

3. [Empty]

    a. The operations component must recognize costs that are allowable under federal medicaid rules for the federal matching percentage. The operations component is calculated at ninety percent or greater of the statewide median nursing facility costs associated with the following:

        i. Supplies;

        ii. Nonlabor administrative expenses;

        iii. Staff education and in-service training; and

        iv. Operational overhead including licenses, insurance, and business and occupation taxes.

    b. For the purposes of this subsection, the operations component does not include costs associated with supportive housing services.

4. The room and board component recognizes costs that do not qualify for federal financial participation under medicaid rules by compensating providers for the medicaid client's share of raw food and shelter costs including expenses related to the physical plant such as property taxes, property and liability insurance, debt service, and major capital repairs. The room and board component is subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility. If client financial responsibility does not cover the full cost of the room and board component, an assisted living facility may receive supplemental payment for the remainder from other sources including, but not limited to, nonmedicaid state, federal, and local sources.

5. [Empty]

    a. The supportive housing services component recognizes costs for services that are provided solely to maintain housing stability of a client and supplement but do not duplicate "assisted living services" as defined in RCW 74.39A.009. An assisted living facility may receive payment for the supportive housing services component from a specialty rate enhancement as described in (b) of this subsection. If the specialty rate enhancement is not available or does not cover the full cost of the supported housing services, an assisted living facility may receive supplemental payment for the remainder from other sources including, but not limited to, nonmedicaid state, federal, and local sources.

    b. No later than June 30, 2025, the department shall work with appropriate stakeholders to establish a specialty rate enhancement for contracted assisted living, adult residential care, and enhanced adult residential care providers to compensate providers for costs associated with delivering supportive housing services. The specialty rate enhancement calculation will consider the number of residents in a facility requiring supportive housing services and the costs associated with the delivery of supportive housing services. The department shall adopt rules that determine the data source and transmittal method for the underlying supportive housing service utilization and cost data needed to calculate this rate.

    c. The total amount provided to contracted assisted living providers for the specialty rate enhancement shall not exceed the amount established in the omnibus appropriations act for this specific purpose.

6. Subsections (2) and (3) of this section establish the rate for medicaid covered services. Subsection (4) of this section establishes the rate for nonmedicaid covered services.

7. The rates paid on July 1, 2019, shall be based on data from the 2016 calendar year, except for the time variable under subsection (2)(a) of this section. The client care and operations components must be rebased in even-numbered years. Beginning with rates paid on July 1, 2020, wages, benefits and taxes, and operations costs shall be rebased using 2018 data.

8. Beginning July 1, 2020, the room and board component shall be updated annually subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.
