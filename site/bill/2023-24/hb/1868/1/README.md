# HB 1868 - Power equipment emissions

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1868.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that gasoline-powered and diesel-powered landscaping and other outdoor power equipment emit a host of air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, carbon dioxide, and other pollutants, contributing to climate change and negatively impacting public health. The air quality, climate change, and other environmental impacts of outdoor power equipment are significant no matter how you measure them, including:

    a. According to one calculation by the United States environmental protection agency, gas-powered mowers contribute five percent of United States air pollution and estimates indicate more than 17,000,000 gallons of fuel, mostly gasoline, is spilled each year while refueling lawn equipment;

    b. Nationally, the department of transportation data shows that in 2018, Americans used nearly 3,000,000,000 gallons of gasoline running lawn and garden equipment, equivalent to the annual energy use of more than 3,000,000 homes;

    c. One hour of running a gas lawnmower can contribute as much smog-forming pollution as driving a passenger car 300 miles; and

    d. One hour of running a gas leaf blower can contribute as much smog-forming pollution as driving a passenger car 1,100 miles.

2. The legislature further finds that the small gas engines used in lawn and garden equipment are not only bad for the environment and contributing to climate change, but they can also cause asthma, hearing loss, and other health issues, especially for workers who regularly use them. Going electric can generate health benefits and protect those who have to hear, handle, and inhale gas engines for hours on end. Additionally, the noise from gas-powered equipment can be a nuisance, with many communities enacting restrictions on the use of commercial lawn equipment. Residents value the quiet of electric equipment, especially with the increasing numbers of people working from home.

3. The legislature further finds that the technology and consumer markets are ready for the transition to cleaner, all-electric lawn and garden equipment. In some instances, electric and battery-operated equipment are just as powerful as gas, and more efficient. The market share of battery-powered lawn equipment is growing at a rate three times faster than gas, and already, many homeowners, businesses, cities, and universities have converted to all-electric landscaping equipment. It is estimated that the volume of electric-powered lawn equipment that North American manufacturers shipped jumped from about 9,000,000 units in 2015 to over 16,000,000 in 2020, an increase of more than 75 percent in only five years, and during that time, electric equipment went from roughly 32 percent to 44 percent of the overall lawn equipment market. Some manufacturers already have plans to cease the production of gas-powered equipment, and numerous other governments, including the state of California, has already found technological progress on electric and battery-powered equipment has made it feasible to restrict gas-powered outdoor power equipment.

4. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish temporary sales and use tax relief and a temporary grant program for zero emissions landscaping equipment to accelerate the phase out of super-polluting fossil fuel-powered equipment in transitioning to cleaner alternatives, and to restrict the introduction of new fossil fuel-powered outdoor landscaping equipment.

## Section 2
1. The department must adopt rules to prohibit engine exhaust and evaporative emissions from new outdoor power equipment. The rules must apply to equipment produced on or after January 1, 2026, or as soon as the department determines is feasible, whichever is later.

2. [Empty]

    a. The rules adopted by the department under subsection (1) of this section may not restrict outdoor power equipment to be used by a federal, state, or local government agency or entity or its contractor for emergency management or response purposes including, but not limited to, wildfires, oil spills, or other natural or human-caused emergency events.

    b. In addition to the exemptions specified in (a) of this subsection, the department may temporarily exempt specific use cases of commercial or residential outdoor power equipment with engine exhaust or evaporative emissions from the restrictions adopted by rule under this section upon determining that a suitable zero emissions outdoor power equipment technology does not exist to satisfy the needs of the specific use case.

3. A violation of the requirements of this section is subject to penalties as provided in this chapter, including as provided in RCW 70A.15.3150 and 70A.15.3160. The department is solely responsible for enforcing the requirements of this section, including through the use of powers enumerated in RCW 70A.15.3140.

4. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Outdoor power equipment" means equipment designed or marketed for use in an outdoor setting in the management of vegetation, landscaped outdoor spaces, or built spaces that is powered by an engine that produces a gross horsepower of less than 25 or is designed to produce less than 25 horsepower. "Outdoor power equipment" includes vegetation cutting equipment, leaf blowers, leaf shredders, leaf vacuums, soil tillers, soil cultivators, augers, mulchers, edgers, wood chippers, stump grinders, pressure washers, snowblowers, tampers, and compactors.

    b. "Vegetation cutting equipment" includes lawn mowers, riding lawn mowers, hedge trimmers, string trimmers, brush cutters, chainsaws, pole trimmers, polesaws, and log splitters.

## Section 3
1. The department must administer an outdoor power equipment grant program for local governments that extensively use outdoor power equipment. Grants issued under this section may only be used to replace existing, working-condition outdoor power equipment powered by liquid or gaseous or fossil fuels with zero emissions outdoor power equipment.

2. Among grants that are issued under this section, the department must prioritize grants that will result in the greatest benefits to vulnerable populations or that will reduce the most hazardous or frequent occupational exposures caused by outdoor power equipment.

3. It is the intent of the legislature to dedicate $5,000,000 per year to the outdoor power equipment grant program, beginning in calendar year 2025 and ending in calendar year 2029.

4. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Outdoor power equipment" has the same meaning as defined in section 2 of this act.
