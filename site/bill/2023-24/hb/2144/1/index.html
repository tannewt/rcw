<p>The legislature finds that the department was directed, through an independent consultant, to study how plastic packaging is managed in the state, to assess various policy options, and to provide recommendations to achieve certain goals, which include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Plastic packaging sold into the state is 100 percent recyclable, reusable, or compostable by January 1, 2025; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plastic packaging sold into the state incorporates at least 50 percent postconsumer recycled content by January 1, 2030.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the study recommends that a deposit return system is an effective way for producers to meet outcomes required by an extended producer responsibility framework.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a 2023 study commissioned by the department examined potential material recovery targets for consumer packaging and found that the best possible recovery, reuse, and recycling outcomes were made possible with an extended producer responsibility system combined with a deposit return system for qualifying beverage containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends that packaging materials be recycled or reused through a deposit return system for qualifying beverage containers and extended producer responsibility programs for other packaging materials. It is the intent of the legislature that a deposit return system for qualifying beverage containers incentivizes innovation, consumer participation, and industry stewardship to minimize environmental impacts.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>After a distributor responsibility organization begins operating a deposit return system, and after notification of noncompliance from the department and a 60-day cure period, the department shall administratively impose a civil penalty to any distributor who fails to participate in a distributor responsibility organization as specified in section 5 of this act, or fails to otherwise comply with the requirements of this chapter by independently carrying out the duties of a distributor responsibility organization described in this chapter, which must be at least 15 cents per beverage in a qualifying beverage container sold or made available for sale by the distributor in the state, or $10,000, whichever is greater.</p>

<li>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in a distributor responsibility organization's bylaws or in a contract between a distributor responsibility organization and an individual distributor arranging specifically for the collection of qualifying beverage containers sold for the purpose of consumption on premises, after a distributor responsibility organization begins operating a deposit return system, any manufacturer, distributor, or importer that fails to pay to a distributor responsibility organization the refund value of qualifying beverage containers included in this chapter is liable to the distributor responsibility organization for treble the unpaid refund value and treble the collection costs incurred by the distributor responsibility organization for any qualifying beverage containers that were sold without the refund value of the container being remitted to the distributor responsibility organization.</p>

<li>
<p>To meet the reuse and recycling performance requirements established in this section, a distributor responsibility organization shall calculate the reuse sales rate and the redemption rate of qualifying beverage containers and provide the verification to the department as part of the annual reporting requirements. The reuse sales rate is the number of qualifying beverage containers in reusable packaging sold in a year. For materials reclaimed under a deposit return system, the calculation point for the redemption rate is the number of qualifying beverage containers redeemed statewide by the distributor responsibility organization divided by the number of beverages in qualifying beverage containers sold in the state by members of the distributor responsibility organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a minimum, a deposit return system plan submitted by a distributor responsibility organization must achieve the following performance requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A minimum of 60 percent of all qualifying beverage containers supplied into the state are redeemed for reuse or recycling through the deposit return system in the data reported for 2029 and thereafter;</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In order to determine compliance with the redemption rate performance targets, the department may, within 120 days of the date that the department receives a report as described in section 18 of this act, review the records of a distributor responsibility organization specifically related to the accuracy of the redemption rate. The records specifically related to the accuracy of the redemption rate do not include financial details of a distributor responsibility organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If in the course of a review described in (a) of this subsection, the department determines that an audit of a distributor responsibility organization is necessary to verify the redemption rate, the department shall require the distributor responsibility organization to retain an independent audit firm to determine the accuracy of the redemption rate. The scope of this audit is limited to records specifically related to the accuracy of the redemption rate. A distributor responsibility organization that is subject to review shall pay the costs of the audit. The audit is limited to the records described in (a) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lieu of any other penalties for not achieving the performance criteria in this section, should the redemption rate performance requirements described in this section not be met, the distributor responsibility organization shall annually calculate the number of containers representing the difference between the redemption rate of qualifying beverage containers and the redemption rate performance requirements described in this section, and pay a penalty that is equal to 10 cents times the number of containers representing the difference, to be deposited into the model toxics control operating account created in RCW 70A.305.180.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the sole discretion of the department, if the requirements of this section result in a penalty to be paid by the distributor responsibility organization, the department may alternatively identify priority areas for additional drop-off access to be provided, or may identify a reduction in the penalty to be paid in conjunction with the identification of priority areas for additional drop-off access to be provided, and the department and the distributor responsibility organization may agree to provide additional access accordingly. If agreement is not reached, the financial penalties in subsection (5) of this section must be paid.</p>

<p>A distributor responsibility organization operating a deposit return system shall provide a refund value of 10 cents per qualifying beverage container purchased in Washington and presented for a refund through the deposit return system, except in cases described in section 19 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a distributor responsibility organization's deposit return system plan is approved by the department, except for containers covered by a small-scale refund program established under section 21 of this act, all qualifying beverage containers sold or offered for sale in the state of Washington must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Carry a 10 cent refund value;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be registered at least annually with the distributor responsibility organization by the producer or distributor, including information on the brand, size, container material type or types, beverage type, bar code or stock-keeping unit information, and total number of containers of each type, size, and brand sold in the state of Washington;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Carry a clear and conspicuous marking indicating the refund value of the container in the state of Washington. This requirement may be satisfied through the abbreviation &quot;WARV&quot; or any other standard abbreviation approved by the department. A qualifying beverage container for wine may satisfy the requirement to indicate the refund value of the container through the use of a quick response code.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A distributor responsibility organization registered with the department may require deposits to be collected to offset the refund value up to 60 days prior to the start of the deposit return system.</p>

<li>
<p>The distributor responsibility organization must, at its own cost, provide a convenient bulk drop-off option for bagged qualifying beverage containers through a network of geographically dispersed locations in Washington that sell beverages in qualifying beverage containers, are located a convenient distance from a dealer, are located at a publicly owned facility, or are otherwise convenient for consumers. The distributor responsibility organization may not charge customers for the use of this drop-off service and must credit the cost of any required bag purchase back to the customer when the bag is returned and processed through the deposit return system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distributor responsibility organization shall provide a sufficient number and distribution of drop-off facilities to achieve the redemption rate performance requirements included in section 9 of this act. The distributor responsibility organization's plan submitted to the department must provide an analysis and rationale supporting how the distributor responsibility organization's proposed distribution of drop-off facilities is designed to meet the redemption rate performance requirements included in section 9 of this act. Within the number of locations necessary to achieve the redemption rate performance targets identified through the analysis and rationale included in its plan, the distributor responsibility organization shall consider the following factors in making drop-off facility location decisions: (a) Proximity to the volume of beverage sales occurring in an area; (b) access in rural counties; (c) access in small cities; (d) convenient access for people living in communities serviced by the Washington state ferries system; and (e) convenient access for people in economically strained areas and in underserved urban areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distributor responsibility organization, with input from the consumer convenience advisory council established in section 14 of this act, may provide alternative access plans for areas where the beverage sales volume would otherwise necessitate drop-off capacity, but where drop-off locations cannot be secured. The department may approve the alternative access plan if it deems it to be similarly convenient to consumers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All dealers over 5,000 square feet and with qualifying beverage container unit sales greater than 100,000 annually must install a self-serve kiosk, provided at no charge by the distributor responsibility organization, to facilitate the printing of redemption vouchers, pay the value of redemption vouchers to customers, and must sell bags for the bulk redemption program at the price established by the distributor responsibility organization. The distributor responsibility organization shall reimburse dealers for the value of valid vouchers redeemed by customers. Dealers may additionally offer a voucher redemption option for funds to be used as store credit. There is no other cost or requirement for dealers associated with container redemption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop-off locations may be located at dealers, or any other retail establishment, publicly owned facility, or any other location convenient to consumers. However, nothing in this chapter may be interpreted to create a legal obligation on the part of dealers either to accept returned qualifying beverage containers or allow a drop-off location to be sited at a dealer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage and drop-off containers sited for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements of this section are considered temporary mobile containers regardless of whether they have wheels, have electrical power, or are affixed to the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the distributor responsibility organization uses automated industrial counting equipment to count containers returned in bulk and credit refund values to consumers, the distributor responsibility organization may use commercially viable methods of counting, and shall have a customer service system, which serves as the sole remedy to resolve complaints and discrepancies.</p>

<p>The number of locations required to be provided by the distributor responsibility organization in an approved plan to achieve the redemption rate performance targets required for the 2032 reporting year must be used to calculate a drop-off capacity formula. The drop-off capacity formula is equal to the ratio of drop-off locations required in the distributor responsibility organization's approved plan to achieve the 2032 redemption rate performance targets to total anticipated sales of beverages in qualifying beverage containers the prior year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five years after the distributor responsibility organization begins operating a deposit return system, and every five years after that, the distributor responsibility organization shall calculate an updated number of drop-off locations required using the drop-off capacity formula. If this calculation determines that the distributor responsibility organization needs to add additional drop-off sites to reach the number required by the drop-off capacity formula, the distributor responsibility organization shall provide the department with a list of proposed new locations, equal to the number determined by the drop-off capacity formula, disbursed based on the factors included in section 12 of this act and input from the consumer convenience advisory council established in section 14 of this act. The distributor responsibility organization shall make the new drop-off locations available within three years.</p>
