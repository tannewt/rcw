<p>FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION—VACANCY-RELATED TRANSFER AUTHORITY</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The appropriations to the department of transportation must be expended for the programs and in the amounts specified in this act. Appropriations made in this act to the department of transportation must initially be allotted as required under this act. Subsequent allotment modifications may not include transfers of appropriation authority between sections of this act except as expressly provided in this act. Allotment modifications may not permit moneys that are provided solely for a specified purpose to be used for another purpose. However, between October 1, 2023, and March 1, 2024, subject to subsection (2)(a) of this section, the department of transportation may transfer state appropriation authority for the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium among operating programs after approval by the director of the office of financial management.</p>

<li>
<p>To ensure that staffing vacancy savings assumed in this act do not impair the ability of each individual program to fill authorized staffing positions, maintain operational capacity, and provide anticipated service delivery levels, the department of transportation may, after approval by the director of the office of financial management: (i) Transfer state motor vehicle account and multimodal transportation account appropriation authority among operating programs, up to the amount of the assumed vacancy savings in each program receiving the transfer; and (ii) make associated staffing-related allotment modifications associated with expenditures for fiscal year 2024. However, transfers authorized in this section may not include the toll operations and maintenance program (program B) or the marine operations program (program X) appropriation authority or allotments, and transfers may only be made within each specific fund source. The department may not transfer appropriation authority, and the director of the office of financial management may not approve the transfer, unless the transfer is consistent with the objective of conserving, to the maximum extent possible, the expenditure of state funds and not federal funds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director of the office of financial management shall notify in writing the transportation committees of the legislature seven days before approving any allotment modifications or transfers under this section. The written notification must include a narrative explanation and justification of the changes, along with expenditures and allotments by programs and appropriation, both before and after any allotment modifications or transfers.</p>

<p>MANAGEMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDS WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT IN SESSION</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The 2005 transportation partnership projects or improvements and 2015 connecting Washington projects or improvements are listed in the LEAP Transportation Document 2023-1 as developed April 21, 2023, which consists of a list of specific projects by fund source and amount over multiple biennia. Current fiscal biennium funding for each project is a line-item appropriation, while the outer year funding allocations represent a 16-year plan. The department of transportation is expected to use the flexibility provided in this section to assist in the delivery and completion of all transportation partnership account and connecting Washington account projects on the LEAP transportation document referenced in this subsection. For the 2023-2025 project appropriations, unless otherwise provided in this act, the director of the office of financial management may provide written authorization for a transfer of appropriation authority between projects funded with transportation partnership account appropriations or connecting Washington account appropriations to manage project spending and efficiently deliver all projects in the respective program under the following conditions and limitations:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Transfers between projects may be made by the department of transportation without the formal written approval provided under this subsection (1), provided that the transfer amount to a single project does not exceed $250,000 or 10 percent of the total project per fiscal biennium, whichever is less.

<p>A special account to be known as the state route number 520 civil penalties account is created in the state treasury. All state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program civil penalties generated from the nonpayment of tolls on the state route number 520 corridor must be deposited into the account, as provided under RCW 47.56.870(4)(b)(vii).

The legislature may direct the state treasurer to make transfers of moneys in the state route number 520 civil penalties account to the state route number 520 corridor account. During the 2021-2023 and 2023-2025 fiscal biennia, the legislature may direct the state treasurer to transfer moneys in the state route number 520 civil penalties account to the motor vehicle account.</p>
