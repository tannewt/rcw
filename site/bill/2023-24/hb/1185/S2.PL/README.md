# HB 1185 - Lighting products

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/1185-S2.PL.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that in 2025 the state's stewardship program for the end-of-life management of mercury-containing lights is statutorily scheduled to undergo review and termination or possible extension under chapter 43.131 RCW, the sunset act. If the mercury-containing lights product stewardship program were allowed to sunset as scheduled, Washington residents would lose a consistent, convenient, and safe way to return unwanted mercury-containing lights, which will remain in use for years as existing inventory winds down, even as the lighting industry has moved away from most mercury-containing lights. Mercury-containing lights present such a significant health risk that other states have recently restricted their sale, which represents a solution to reduce the public health impacts of new lighting products, but does not address the end-of-life management issues associated with the existing light bulbs currently in use.

2. The state's existing mercury-containing lights program, which was first enacted over a decade ago, contains policy provisions, including the establishment of a per-bulb fee attached to the sale of mercury-containing lights, that are now recognized as not representing the best practices for the design of stewardship programs.

3. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to:

    a. Restrict the sale of most mercury-containing lights;

    b. Extend the implementation of the stewardship program for mercury-containing lights; and

    c. Modernize key elements of the state's mercury-containing lights stewardship program.

## Section 2
1. Effective January 1, 2004, a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer may not knowingly sell at retail a fluorescent lamp if the fluorescent lamp contains mercury and was manufactured after November 30, 2003, unless the fluorescent lamp is labeled in accordance with the guidelines listed under subsection (2) of this section. Primary responsibility for affixing labels required under this section is on the manufacturer, and not on the wholesaler or retailer.

2. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a lamp is considered labeled pursuant to subsection (1) of this section if the lamp has all of the following:

    a. A label affixed to the lamp that displays the internationally recognized symbol for the element mercury; and

    b. A label on the lamp's packaging that: (i) Clearly informs the purchaser that mercury is present in the item; (ii) explains that the fluorescent lamp should be disposed of according to applicable federal, state, and local laws; and (iii) provides a toll-free telephone number, and a uniform resource locator internet address to a website, that contains information on applicable disposal laws.

3. The manufacturer of a mercury-added lamp is in compliance with the requirements of this section if the manufacturer is in compliance with the labeling requirements of another state.

4. The provisions of this section do not apply to products containing mercury-added lamps.

In making its determination, the department shall review the product stewardship plan and may consult with the producers, the stewardship organization, retailers, collectors, recyclers, and other entities.

3. No sooner than January 1, 2015, and through calendar year 2028 of program implementation:

    a. The mercury-containing light environmental handling charge must be added to the purchase price of all mercury-containing lights sold to Washington retailers for sale at retail, and each Washington retailer shall add the charge to the purchase price of all mercury-containing lights sold at retail in this state, and the producer shall remit the environmental handling charge to the stewardship organization in the manner provided for in the stewardship plan; or

    b. Each Washington retailer must add the mercury-containing light environmental handling charge to the purchase price of all mercury-containing lights sold at retail in this state, where the retailer, by voluntary binding agreement with the producer, arranges to remit the environmental handling charge to the stewardship organization on behalf of the producer in the manner provided for in the stewardship plan. Producers may not require retailers to opt for this provision via contract, marketing practice, or any other means. The stewardship organization must allow retailers to retain a portion of the environmental handling charge as reimbursement for any costs associated with the collection and remittance of the charge.

4. At any time, a stewardship organization may submit to the department a recommendation for an adjusted environmental handling charge for the department's review, adjustment, if necessary, and approval under subsection (2) of this section to ensure that there is sufficient revenue to fund the cost of the program, current deficits, or projected needed reserves for the next year. Until December 31, 2028, a stewardship organization may submit to the department a recommended adjustment to the environmental handling charge that is designed to provide revenue necessary and sufficient to cover all administrative and operational costs associated with the stewardship program described in the department-approved product stewardship plan for that organization. The stewardship organization may propose to use revenues from environmental handling charges to cover program expenses through calendar year 2029. The department must review the stewardship organization's recommended environmental handling charge and must adjust or approve the recommended charge within thirty days of submittal if the department determines that the charge is reasonably designed to meet the criteria described in subsection (1) of this section.

    a. Beginning with calendar year 2029 of program implementation, each stewardship organization must develop and implement a system to collect charges from participating legacy producers to cover the costs of plan implementation based on the market share of participating producers using all reasonable means and based on the best available information. A stewardship organization must determine each producer's percentage of market share by:

        i. To the extent data necessary to make such a calculation are available, dividing each legacy producer's total units of mercury-containing lights for which the producer had an obligation under this chapter sold in Washington at any point in time between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2028, by the sum total of all units of mercury-containing lights sold in or into Washington by all participating legacy producers at any point in time between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2028; and

        ii. To the extent that data specified in (a)(i) of this subsection are not fully available, extrapolating a reasonable approximation of a manufacturer's market share similar to the calculation specified in (a)(i) of this section based on the data available to the stewardship organization.

    b. To determine the market share of legacy producers, a stewardship organization may:

        i. Require data from legacy producers. A stewardship organization may notify the department if a legacy producer has declined to respond within 90 days to a demand for data by a stewardship organization and the department may demand the information if it is determined to be necessary to calculate the market share of the legacy producer; and

        ii. Use any combination of the following types of data:

(A) Generally available market research data;

(B) Data historically provided by producers or retailers to a stewardship organization or the department under this chapter;

(C) Sales data supplied by producers; and

(D) Sales data provided by retailers.

    c. The amendments to the method of financing the program described in this act must be implemented by a stewardship organization by January 1, 2029.

6. Beginning with calendar year 2029 of program implementation, each stewardship organization is responsible for all costs of participating mercury-containing light collection, transportation, processing, education, administration, agency reimbursement, recycling, and end-of-life management in accordance with environmentally sound management practices.

7. Beginning March 1, 2015, until March 1, 2024, each stewardship organization shall pay to the department an annual fee equivalent to $3,000 for each participating producer to cover the department's administrative and enforcement costs. Beginning March 1, 2025, each stewardship organization shall pay to the department the annual fee to cover the department's administrative and enforcement costs. The department must apply any remaining annual payment funds from the current year to the annual payment for the coming fiscal year if the collected annual payment exceeds the department's costs for a given year and increase annual payments for the coming fiscal year to cover the department's fees if the collected annual payment was less than the department's costs for a given year. The amount paid under this section must be deposited into the mercury-containing light product stewardship programs account created in RCW 70A.505.120.

## Section 8
1. All mercury-containing lights and materials recovered from mercury-containing lights collected in the state by product stewardship programs or other collection programs must be recycled and any process residuals must be managed in compliance with applicable laws.

## Section 9
1. Except for persons involved in registered mail-back programs, a person who collects unwanted mercury-containing lights in the state, receives funding through a product stewardship program for mercury-containing lights, and who is not a generator of unwanted mercury-containing lights must:

    a. Register with the department as a collector of unwanted mercury-containing lights. Until the department adopts rules for collectors, the collector must provide to the department the legal name of the person or entity owning and operating the collection location, the address and phone number of the collection location, and the name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible for operating the collection location and update any changes in this information within thirty days of the change;

    b. Maintain a spill and release response plan at the collection location that describes the materials, equipment, and procedures that will be used to respond to any mercury release from an unwanted mercury-containing light;

    c. Maintain a worker safety plan at the collection location that describes the handling of the unwanted mercury-containing lights at the collection location and measures that will be taken to protect worker health and safety; and

    d. Use packaging and shipping material that will minimize the release of mercury into the environment and minimize breakage and use mercury vapor barrier packaging if mercury-containing lights are transported by the United States postal service or a common carrier.

2. A person who operates a curbside collection program or owns or operates a mail-back business participating in a product stewardship program for mercury-containing lights and uses the United States postal service or a common carrier for transport of mercury-containing lights must register with the department and use mercury vapor barrier packaging for curbside collection and mail-back containers.
