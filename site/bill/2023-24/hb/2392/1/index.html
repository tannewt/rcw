<p>The legislature finds that kimchi is a traditional Korean dish with a long, rich history beginning over 2,000 years ago during the time of the three kingdoms of Korea. &quot;Kimjang,&quot; the process by which kimchi is prepared, has been recognized as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity by the United Nations educational, scientific, and cultural organization. Kimchi is found for sale across the United States at major retailers and is becoming an international staple as an excellent source of probiotics, filate, beta-carotene, choline, potassium, calcium, and vitamins A, C, and K, many of which contribute to lower rates of stroke, cancer, and diabetes. The legislature further finds that South Korea celebrates &quot;national kimchi day&quot; on November 22nd, representing the 11 major ingredients and 22 health benefits of the dish. The states of California, Virginia, and Hawaii also recognize this day. The legislature intends to join these governments by recognizing November 22nd of each year as &quot;kimchi day.&quot;</p>
