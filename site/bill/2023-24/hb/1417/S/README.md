# HB 1417 - Multistate nurse licensure

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1417-S.pdf)

## Section 1
This act shall be known and cited as the interstate nurse licensure compact.

## Section 2
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;

    b. Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;

    c. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;

    d. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;

    e. The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and

    f. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.

2. The general purposes of this compact are to:

    a. Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;

    b. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;

    c. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;

    d. Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;

    e. Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;

    f. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and

    g. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.

## Section 3
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

5. "Encumbrance" means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board.

6. "Home state" means the party state which is the nurse's primary state of residence.

State practice laws do not include requirements necessary to obtain and retain a license, except for qualifications or requirements of the home state.

## Section 4
1. A multistate license to practice registered or licensed practical or vocational nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a nurse to practice as a registered nurse, or licensed practical or vocational nurse, under a multistate licensure privilege, in each party state.

2. A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement. Such procedures shall include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the federal bureau of investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records.

3. Each party state shall require the following for an applicant to obtain or retain a multistate license in the home state:

    k. Has a valid United States social security number.

4. All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with existing state due process law, to take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, or any other action that affects a nurse's authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.

5. A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.

6. Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license.

7. Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of this compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse's then-current home state, provided that:

    a. A nurse, who changes primary state of residence after the effective date of this compact, must meet all applicable requirements of subsection (3) of this section to obtain a multistate license from a new home state.

    b. A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in subsection (3) of this section due to a disqualifying event occurring after the effective date of this compact shall be ineligible to retain or renew a multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the interstate commission.

## Section 5
1. Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.

2. A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.

3. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the interstate commission.

    a. The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.

    b. A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.

4. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.

## Section 6
1. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:

    a. Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.

        i. Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the home state.

        ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action;

    b. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that party state;

    c. Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions;

    d. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located;

    e. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks, and use the results in making licensure decisions;

    f. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse;

    g. Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.

2. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.

3. Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program.

## Section 7
1. All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses, and licensed practical or vocational nurses. This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.

2. The interstate commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this compact.

3. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications, the reasons for such denials, and nurse participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or confidential under state law.

4. Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.

5. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.

6. Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.

7. Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.

8. The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:

    a. Identifying information;

    b. Licensure data;

    c. Information related to alternative program participation; and

    d. Other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by interstate commission rules.

9. The compact administrator of a party state shall provide all investigative documents and information requested by another party state.

## Section 8
1. The party states hereby create and establish a joint public entity known as the interstate commission of nurse licensure compact administrators.

    a. The interstate commission is an instrumentality of the party states.

    b. Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the interstate commission shall be brought solely and exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the interstate commission is located.

    b. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the interstate commission at hearings required by this section.

8. If no one appears at the public hearing, the interstate commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule.

9. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the interstate commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.

10. The interstate commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rule-making record and the full text of the rule.

11. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the interstate commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rule-making procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:

The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the interstate commission, prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the interstate commission.

## Section 10
1. Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact's purposes and intent.

2. The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.

    a. If the interstate commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:

        i. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the interstate commission; and

        ii. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.

    b. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.

    c. Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
