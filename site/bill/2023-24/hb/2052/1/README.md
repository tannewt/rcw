## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. In any construction or renovation subject to the requirements of this chapter in which public restrooms are required under the international building code as amended and adopted by the state building code council, the rules adopted by the state building code council must also require within the building the provision of a safe, sanitary, and convenient baby diaper changing station in at least one restroom that is accessible to women and one restroom that is accessible to men, or in one gender-neutral restroom. If multiple restrooms accessible to women, restrooms accessible to men, or gender-neutral restrooms exist, each restroom that does not include a baby diaper changing station must contain clear and conspicuous signage indicating where a restroom with a baby diaper changing station is located.

    b. This section does not apply to an industrial building or to a commercial building that does not permit anyone who is under 18 years of age to enter the premises. This section also does not apply to a restroom located in a health care facility if the restroom is intended for the use of one patient or resident at a time and is not available for public use. For the purposes of this section, "health care facility" has the same meaning as in RCW 70.02.010.

2. The rules required under this section must take effect and be implemented by July 1, 2025, and may be periodically updated thereafter.

3. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Baby diaper changing station" means a table or other device suitable for changing the diaper of a child weighing less than 50 pounds that is in compliance with international building code standards as amended and adopted by the state building code council.

    b. "Gender-neutral restroom" means a restroom that is not restricted by gender including, but not limited to, restrooms available for use by families.

    c. "Renovation" means a change to a public restroom for which a permit is required.
