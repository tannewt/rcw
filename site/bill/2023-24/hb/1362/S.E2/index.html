<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that requiring state agencies to report to the legislature is an important method of providing information and keeping the legislature informed on the implementation and impacts of legislation. Some reports provide information that is no longer relevant or useful to the legislature, which can be discerned by the lack of interest in the report. There are other reports that are redundant as the information is provided through other means. In addition, preparing reports is time consuming, and there may be better, more efficient mechanisms for sharing information with legislators as well as the public, such as posting the information on agency websites. Finally, some reports are required on a more frequent basis than is necessary, as the information does not change to an extent that merits the increased frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to improve agency efficiency and still ensure that information is publicly available and provided to the legislature as needed, it is the intent of this act to eliminate reports that no longer serve a relevant purpose, change reporting frequency where warranted, and provide alternative mechanisms in place of submitting reports where appropriate.</p>

<p>A request by a beneficiary that the borrower waive future claims he or she may have in connection with the deed of trust, as a condition of agreeing to a modification, except for rescission claims under the federal truth in lending act.

<p>If the mediator reasonably believes a borrower will not attend a mediation session based on the borrower's conduct, such as the lack of response to the mediator's communications, the mediator may cancel a scheduled mediation session and send a written cancellation to the department and the trustee and send copies to the parties.

<p>The mediator's certification that the beneficiary failed to act in good faith during mediation does not constitute a defense to a judicial foreclosure or a future nonjudicial foreclosure action if a modification of the loan is agreed upon and the borrower subsequently defaults.</p>

For a mediation session exceeding three hours, the foreclosure mediator may charge a reasonable fee, as authorized by the department. The mediator must provide an estimated fee before the mediation, and payment of the mediator's fee must be divided equally between the beneficiary and the borrower. The beneficiary and the borrower must tender the loan mediator's fee within 30 calendar days from receipt of the department's letter referring the parties to mediation or pursuant to the mediator's instructions.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated specifically for this purpose, the academic acceleration incentive program is established as provided in this section. The intent of the legislature is that the funds awarded under the program be used to support teacher training, curriculum, technology, examination fees, textbook fees, and other costs associated with offering dual credit courses to high school students, including transportation for running start students to and from the institution of higher education as defined in RCW 28A.600.300.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall allocate half of the funds appropriated for the purposes of this section on a competitive basis to provide one-time grants for high schools to expand the availability of dual credit courses. To be eligible for a grant, a school district must have adopted an academic acceleration policy as provided under RCW 28A.320.195. In making grant awards, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must give priority to grants for high schools with a high proportion of low-income students and high schools seeking to develop new capacity for dual credit courses rather than proposing marginal expansion of current capacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall allocate half of the funds appropriated for the purposes of this section to school districts as an incentive award for each student who earned dual high school and college credit, as described under subsection (4) of this section, for courses offered by the district's high schools during the previous school year. School districts must distribute the award to the high schools that generated the funds. The award amount for low-income students eligible to participate in the federal free and reduced-price meals program who earn dual credits must be set at 125 percent of the base award for other students. A student who earns more than one dual credit in the same school year counts only once for the purposes of the incentive award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the following students are considered to have earned dual high school and college credit in a course offered by a high school:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Students who achieve a score of three or higher on an AP examination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who achieve a score of four or higher on an examination of the international baccalaureate diploma programme;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who successfully complete a Cambridge advanced international certificate of education examination;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who successfully complete a course through the college in the high school program under RCW 28A.600.287 and are awarded credit by the partnering institution of higher education; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who satisfy the dual enrollment and class performance requirements to earn college credit through a career and technical education course.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a high school provides access to online courses for students to earn dual high school and college credit at no cost to the student, such a course is considered to be offered by the high school.</p>

<p>The council must convene work groups to develop transfer associate degrees that will satisfy lower division requirements at public four-year institutions of higher education for specific academic majors. Work groups must include representatives from the state board for community and technical colleges and the council of presidents, as well as faculty from two and four-year institutions. Work groups may include representatives from independent four-year institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each transfer associate degree developed under this section must enable a student to complete the lower-division courses or competencies for general education requirements and preparation for the major that a direct-entry student would typically complete in the first-year student and sophomore years for that academic major.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion of a transfer associate degree does not guarantee a student admission into an institution of higher education or admission into a major, minor, or professional program at an institution of higher education that has competitive admission standards for the program based on grade point average or other performance criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 2004-05 academic year, the work groups must develop transfer degrees for elementary education, engineering, and nursing. As necessary based on demand or identified need, the council must convene additional groups to identify and develop additional transfer degrees. The council must give priority to majors in high demand by transfer students and majors that the general direct transfer agreement associate degree does not adequately prepare students to enter automatically upon transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The council, in collaboration with the intercollege relations commission, must collect and maintain lists of courses offered by each community and technical college and public four-year institution of higher education that fall within each transfer associate degree.</p>
