    b. Social-emotional learning;

    c. Mentorship;

    d. Connection to nonschool-based resources;

    e. Support related to postsecondary access and career pathways;

    a. Youth ages 14 through 26;

    b. People with lived experience providing or receiving services from a youth development program;

    c. Youth development program providers serving local communities and operating statewide;

    d. Youth development program providers serving local communities and not operating statewide; and

    e. Tribes within Washington state.

3. The design of the grant program for youth development programs required under this section must include the following components:

    a. Equity in:

        i. Size and type of organizations receiving the grants;

        ii. Geographic distribution of grant funding throughout all six department of children, youth, and families regions of the state; and

        iii. Distribution of grant funding to urban, suburban, and rural areas;

    b. Prioritization of grants to:

        i. Support youth from historically marginalized communities; and

        ii. Youth development providers that represent the historically marginalized communities of the youth that they serve;

    c. Distribution of grants to nonprofit entities, entities sponsored by a nonprofit organization, tribes within Washington state, and city or county parks and recreation entities;

    d. The prohibition of grant distribution to school districts;

    e. Distribution of grant funding for the full fiscal biennium;

5. For purposes of this section:

    a. "Expanded learning opportunities" means a structured learning environment that occurs outside the traditional school day through before school, after school, and summer programs. Expanded learning opportunities offer a safe place for students where education can be supported and supplemented. Expanded learning opportunities offer personalized learning opportunities for youth in areas such as:

        i. The arts including but not limited to the performing arts, visual arts, literature, fine arts, craft arts, creative writing, architecture, and music;

        ii. Civic engagement;

        iii. Science;

        iv. Technology;

    v. Engineering;

    vi. Math;

    vii. Mentorship; and

    viii. General academic support.

    b. "Youth development" means an intentional, strength-based approach that inclusively and equitably engages young people within their communities in a manner that centers youth voice and leadership. Youth development is culturally responsive, fosters positive relationships, and helps young people develop skills and competencies to achieve their goals.

    c. "Youth development program" means a program for youth that focus on holistic outcomes by complementing school-day academics, promotes social and emotional well-being, and supports access to postsecondary career pathways. Youth development programs may not provide basic needs services such as shelter or food outside of program time, but they can function as a referral resource to help young people and families identify and navigate those services. A youth development program may include mentoring, expanded learning opportunities, afterschool or summer programs, school-aged child care, or other child supports that address the comprehensive needs of young people.
