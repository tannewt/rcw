# HB 1814 - Vaccine mandate/reemployment

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1814.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that governor executive order 22-13 required nearly all state employees to be vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. This order resulted in the loss of nearly 1,900 state employees, including 400 transportation workers, which led to curtailed ferry service, reduced snowplow service, and fewer state patrol officers. The legislature further finds that vaccine requirements for state employees continue to evolve as the most recently negotiated state employee collective bargaining agreements remove the vaccine booster requirement and replace it with a $1,000 incentive payment. In light of recent and future changes to employer mandated vaccination policies, it is the intent of the legislature to facilitate the efficient return of state employees who separated from employment due to mandatory vaccination policies, by providing a hiring preference. It is also the intent of the legislature to permit these individuals, employed by both the state and local governments, to make employee contributions and receive state retirement system service credit for specified periods of work missed due to employer mandated vaccination policies.

## Section 2
1. In all competitive examinations, unless otherwise provided in this section, to determine the qualifications of applicants for public offices, positions, or employment, either the state, and all of its political subdivisions and all municipal corporations, or private companies or agencies contracted with by the state to give the competitive examinations shall give a scoring criteria status to individuals separated from employment due to vaccination status during the 2020, 2021, or 2022 calendar years. This preference must be implemented by adding 10 percent to the passing mark, grade or rating only, based upon a possible rating of 100 points.

2. The vaccination status scoring criteria may be claimed upon submission by an applicant to a prospective employer, as listed in subsection (1) of this section, of either proof of dismissal related to vaccination status, or proof of the prior employer's vaccination policy, and an affidavit that the applicant separated from employment due to the employer policy.

## Section 3
1. A member who is on a paid leave of absence authorized by a member's employer shall continue to receive service credit as provided for under the provisions of RCW 41.26.410 through 41.26.550.

2. A member who receives compensation from an employer while on an authorized leave of absence to serve as an elected official of a labor organization, and whose employer is reimbursed by the labor organization for the compensation paid to the member during the period of absence, may also be considered to be on a paid leave of absence. This subsection shall only apply if the member's leave of absence is authorized by a collective bargaining agreement that provides that the member retains seniority rights with the employer during the period of leave. The basic salary reported for a member who establishes service credit under this subsection may not be greater than the salary paid to the highest paid job class covered by the collective bargaining agreement.

3. Except as specified in subsection (7) of this section, a member shall be eligible to receive a maximum of two years service credit during a member's entire working career for those periods when a member is on an unpaid leave of absence authorized by an employer. Such credit may be obtained only if the member makes the employer, member, and state contributions plus interest as determined by the department for the period of the authorized leave of absence within five years of resumption of service or prior to retirement whichever comes sooner.

4. A law enforcement member may be authorized by an employer to work part time and to go on a part-time leave of absence. During a part-time leave of absence a member is prohibited from any other employment with their employer. A member is eligible to receive credit for any portion of service credit not earned during a month of part-time leave of absence if the member makes the employer, member, and state contributions, plus interest, as determined by the department for the period of the authorized leave within five years of resumption of full-time service or prior to retirement whichever comes sooner. Any service credit purchased for a part-time leave of absence is included in the two-year maximum provided in subsection (3) of this section.

5. If a member fails to meet the time limitations of subsection (3) or (4) of this section, the member may receive a maximum of two years of service credit during a member's working career for those periods when a member is on unpaid leave of absence authorized by an employer. This may be done by paying the amount required under RCW 41.50.165(2) prior to retirement.

6.

7. A member who leaves the employ of an employer to enter the uniformed services of the United States shall be entitled to retirement system service credit for up to five years of military service.
