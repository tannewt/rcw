<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that without basic digital literacy and technological confidence, Washingtonians cannot access information technology or information technology-enabled jobs, or the education and training programs to prepare them for those jobs. As job functions or components of functions are digitized, these individuals fall increasingly further behind economically and socially.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that recent technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud, and quantum computing have made the tools of digitization widely accessible and pervasive across all sectors with the ability to dramatically change the nature of work and the value of human capital in the marketplace. Workers must become adept at operating in an increasingly digitized world to perform at the highest levels of proficiency and productivity, and to influence and navigate employment and earnings potential.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish the digital empowerment and workforce inclusion act to bring awareness to historically marginalized and underrepresented communities and to create opportunities to build confidence using technology, digital literacy education, and support for entry and professional growth in information technology-enabled careers.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Subject to availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the Washington digital empowerment and workforce inclusion act is established to support historically marginalized people and communities in achieving meaningful and verifiable levels of digital literacy and to access and progress in information technology and information technology-enabled careers.</p>
