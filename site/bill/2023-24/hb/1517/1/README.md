# HB 1517 - Transit-oriented development

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1517.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the state has made groundbreaking investments in state-of-the-art mass transit and intermodal infrastructure. The legislature finds that to maximize the state's return on these investments, land use policies and practices must keep pace with progress being implemented in transportation infrastructure development.

The legislature recognizes that cities planning under chapter 36.70A RCW require direction and technical assistance to ensure the benefits of state transportation investments are maximized and shared equitably while avoiding unnecessary programmatic and cost burdens to local governments in their comprehensive planning, code enactment, and permit processing workloads. The legislature further recognizes that regulatory flexibility and local control are also important features of optimal planning outcomes.

## Section 2
1. The department must create a new division within its agency or expand an existing division within its agency to do the following:

    a. Provide technical assistance and award planning grants to cities to implement the requirements under section 6 of this act;

    b. Provide compliance review of any transit-oriented development regulations adopted consistent with section 6 of this act; and
