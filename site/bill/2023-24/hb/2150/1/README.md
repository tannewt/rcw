2. The filing officer shall not accept a declaration of candidacy submitted by a person who does not attest that they are eligible for that office. The secretary of state shall develop a standard oath for applicants to attest that they meet all eligibility requirements for office.

This subsection applies to a special, primary, or general election.

If a candidate is ineligible for that office, the secretary of state shall issue an order stating that the person is disqualified from that office.

In such a case, the candidate's name shall not appear on the ballot for that position; or if ballots have already been printed for distribution to voters, votes for that person shall not be counted.

## Section 4

## Section 5
1. A person filing a declaration of candidacy for an office shall, at the time of filing, be a registered voter and possess the qualifications specified by law, including those provided in section 2 of this act, for persons who may be elected to the office. In accordance with section 1(2) of this act, the filing officer shall not accept a declaration of candidacy from any person who does not attest that they meet such qualifications.

2. Excluding the office of precinct committee officer or a temporary elected position such as a charter review board member or freeholder, no person may file for more than one office.

Once submitted, changes must not be made to the candidates that will appear on the ballot.

2. No later than the seventh day before the presidential nomination primary, the chair of each party must submit to the secretary of state the names of write-in candidates, if any, to be counted for that party.

3. Notwithstanding the party's submissions, the secretary of state shall not include on the presidential primary ballot the name of any candidate who is disqualified from office under chapter 29A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 9 of this act).

## Section 7

The party or convention shall file with the secretary of state a certificate signed by the presiding officer of the convention at which the presidential electors were chosen, listing the names and addresses of the presidential electors.

The votes cast for candidates for president and vice president of each political party shall be counted for the candidates for presidential electors of that political party; however, if the interstate compact entitled the "agreement among the states to elect the president by national popular vote," as set forth in RCW 29A.56.300, governs the appointment of the presidential electors for a presidential election as provided in clause 9 of Article III of that compact, then the final appointment of presidential electors for that presidential election shall be in accordance with that compact.
