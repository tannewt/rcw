<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that over 1,200,000 Washingtonians qualify for the affordable connectivity program operated by the federal communications commission, which subsidizes internet service and digital devices, and 330,000 have utilized this program as of December 2023. However, the legislature finds that future federal funding for the program is uncertain. The legislature finds that 225,000 households in Washington earn more than the income cutoff for the affordable connectivity program, but not enough to cover average living expenses according to the federal self-sufficiency standard developed by the University of Washington.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that state agencies need funding to adapt their programs to include digital access and adoption. The legislature further finds that there is a need to fund community-based organizations and to build public private partnerships to reach customers who qualify for subsidies and digital skill building.</p>
