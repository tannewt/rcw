## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Seventy percent of Washingtonians will eventually need long-term services and supports, including help with activities of daily living such as bathing, eating, and taking medications;

    b. Long-term care can be expensive, most long-term care services are not covered by medicare or private health insurance, and medicaid only covers services after a person has spent their life savings down to $2,000; and

    c. The WA Cares fund is the result of years of research on how to make long-term services and supports accessible for all workers in Washington. As a public long-term care insurance program, WA Cares guarantees coverage for all workers regardless of preexisting conditions. Washington is the first state in the nation to create an affordable way for the broad middle class to access long-term services and supports without having to spend down their life savings.

2. [Empty]

    a. The legislature intends to improve the functionality of the WA Cares fund for Washington workers by increasing access to the benefits of the program by allowing anyone with at least three years of qualifying contributions who leaves the state to elect portable benefits coverage by choosing to continue contributing premiums to the WA Cares fund, allowing individuals who have purchased private long-term care insurance to rescind the exemption and elect to join the program, and establishing private market long-term care insurance options to enhance the benefits of the program; and

The employment security department may collect due and unpaid premiums and may levy an additional premium for the remainder of the period of coverage. The cancellation must be effective no later than 30 days from the date of the notice in writing advising the out-of-state participant of the cancellation.

5. The employment security department shall:

    a. Adopt standards by rule for the manner and timing of reporting and documentation submission for out-of-state participants.

All receipts from employers under RCW 50B.04.080 and from out-of-state participants under section 2 of this act, and any funds attributable to savings derived through a waiver with the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services pursuant to RCW 50B.04.130 must be deposited in the account. Expenditures from the account may be used for the administrative activities of the department of social and health services, the health care authority, and the employment security department.

3. The moneys deposited in the account must remain in the account until expended in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. If moneys are appropriated for any purpose other than supporting the long-term services and supports program, the legislature shall notify each qualified individual by mail that the person's premiums have been appropriated for an alternate use, describe the alternate use, and state its plan for restoring the funds so that premiums are not increased and benefits are not reduced.

## Section 13

When a qualified individual applies for benefits as provided in RCW 50B.040.060, the department of social and health services must: (a) Ask whether the qualified individual has supplemental long-term care insurance as provided in chapter 48.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 38 of this act); and (b) request written consent and the policy issuer's contact information from the qualified individual to share information with the policy issuer for any potential care coordination.

2. If the individual provides written consent and the policy issuer's contact information, the department of social and health services must notify the policy issuer that the qualified individual has applied for benefits under this chapter and may share information for any potential care coordination.

3. Only basic demographic information that would allow a person to be identified in the program may be shared if the qualified individual consents to sharing information. No health information or data on claims may be shared.

## Section 14
1. The department of social and health services, the employment security department, and the health care authority may design and conduct a pilot project to assess the administrative processes and system capabilities for managing eligibility determinations for qualified individuals and distributing payments to long-term services and supports providers. The pilot project may identify persons who are eligible to be qualified individuals, except that they do not meet the duration requirements under RCW 50B.04.050, and offer them access to benefit units under the program in return for their participation in the pilot project. The pilot project may only be conducted between January 1, 2026, and June 30, 2026. The pilot project may not have more than 500 participants.

2. When designing and implementing the pilot project, the agencies identified in subsection (1) of this section must provide regular updates to and consider recommendations from the long-term services and supports trust commission. Upon completion of the pilot project, the agencies must provide a summary of the pilot project, including key operational challenges, to the commission. The commission may include any outstanding concerns identified by the pilot project that require a legislative response in the commission's 2027 report.

3. The employment security department may adopt rules necessary to implement this section.

Unless otherwise provided in the policy or certificate and regardless of whether it is disclosed on the application, a preexisting condition need not be covered until the waiting period expires.

5. A supplemental long-term care insurance policy or certificate may not exclude or use waivers or riders to exclude, limit, or reduce coverage or benefits for specifically named or described preexisting diseases or physical conditions beyond the waiting period.

## Section 20

        ii. The issuer must accept notice from the department of social and health services that the policyholder has exhausted the benefits provided under chapter 50B.04 RCW as evidence of satisfying the deductible. However, for a policyholder born before 1968, the department must provide the amount of benefits paid under chapter 50B.04 RCW as evidence of payment toward the deductible;

    j. Include an elimination period of greater than 12 months. Any period of time the policyholder is considered an eligible beneficiary as defined in RCW 50B.04.010 must count toward any elimination period in a supplemental long-term care insurance policy.

If the issuer makes a determination that the care setting or providers are not suited to meeting the care and safety needs of the policyholder, the issuer may require a change of care setting or provider under the policy, effective 90 days after the transition from the benefits provided under chapter 50B.04 RCW. The policyholder may appeal the determination through an independent third-party review as tracked by the commissioner.

    a. A policy or certificate has been in force for less than six months and upon a showing of misrepresentation that is material to the acceptance for coverage; or

    b. A policy or certificate has been in force for at least six months but less than two years, upon a showing of misrepresentation that is both material to the acceptance for coverage and that pertains to the condition for which benefits are sought.

## Section 29
1. Except as provided by this section, a supplemental long-term care insurance policy may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the policyholder or certificate holder has been offered the option of purchasing a policy or certificate that includes a nonforfeiture benefit.

3. The commissioner must adopt rules specifying the type or types of nonforfeiture benefits to be offered as part of supplemental long-term care insurance policies and certificates, the standards for nonforfeiture benefits, and the rules regarding contingent benefit upon lapse, including a determination of the specified period of time during which a contingent benefit upon lapse will be available and the substantial premium rate increase that triggers a contingent benefit upon lapse.

## Section 35
1. The commissioner must:

    a. Develop a consumer education guide designed to educate consumers and help them make informed decisions as to the purchase of supplemental long-term care insurance policies provided under this chapter; and

    b. Expand programs to educate consumers as to the supplemental long-term care insurance policies provided under this chapter, with a focus on the middle-income market. If allowable under federal law, the commissioner must expand the statewide health insurance benefits advisor program to provide the consumer education.

2. The guide and programs should:

    a. Provide additional information and counseling for consumers born before 1968.

    b. Support consumers in assessing the tradeoffs between various elimination period options and premium rates.

    c. Educate consumers on budgeting any benefits available under chapter 50B.04 RCW carefully to reduce the likelihood and size of any potential gap between those benefits and the supplemental long-term care insurance.
