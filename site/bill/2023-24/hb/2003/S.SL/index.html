<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to incentivize the placement of affordable housing on public lands.</p>
</li>

<p>If a review by the joint legislative audit and review committee finds that the number of affordable housing units placed on public lands increased following the enactment of this tax preference, the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to the number of new leasehold agreements on public lands for the purposes of affordable housing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
