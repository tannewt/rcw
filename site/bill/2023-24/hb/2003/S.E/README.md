## Section 2
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 1, chapter . . ., Laws of 2024 (section 1 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCWÂ 82.32.808(2)(a).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to incentivize the placement of affordable housing on public lands.

4. If a review by the joint legislative audit and review committee finds that the number of affordable housing units placed on public lands increased following the enactment of this tax preference, the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preference.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to the number of new leasehold agreements on public lands for the purposes of affordable housing.

## Section 3
RCW 82.32.805 does not apply to this act.
