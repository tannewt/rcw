<p>The legislature finds that each year the people of the great state of Washington unite to celebrate the Lunar New Year, joining to distinguish Asian American joy, cultures, and beautiful diversity. The legislature further acknowledges both the wonderful heritage and collective trauma of our Asian American ancestors, and it deeply appreciates the Asian American community that has made Washington a vibrant place for us all to call home, building and supporting their communities despite the uncertainty they have faced at times. The legislature highlights the solidarity and strength of the Asian American community in the face of violent racism, during the past few years, well before, and ongoing. The legislature intends the Lunar New Year to serve as a time to embrace reflections and understanding as we look towards renewal.</p>
