# HB 1554 - Lead impacts

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1554.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that even though lead is a widely recognized hazard to human health and to the environment, and leaded motor vehicle gasoline was phased out across the United States decades ago, leaded gasoline remains in widespread use at general aviation airports by piston engine noncommercial aircraft. Recent studies have found elevated levels of lead in the blood of residents, and particularly worryingly in the blood of children residing in general aviation airport communities, for whom lead is especially harmful to their development. There is consensus among the medical and scientific communities that the levels detected in children living around general airports similar to those in Washington are hazardous. The national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine in 2015 concluded that lead "is a well-known air pollutant that can lead to a variety of adverse health impacts, including neurological effects in children that lead to behavioral problems, learning deficits, and lowered IQ."

2. The United States environmental protection agency has recently taken steps towards making an endangerment finding that may eventually lead, through a complex federal regulatory process involving the United States federal aviation administration, to the elimination of lead from aviation gasoline. That unfolding federal process is too slow to adequately protect those currently living near general aviation airports from the harms of lead.

3. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to phase out the use of leaded aviation gasoline at airports in Washington, to take steps to mitigate public health and environmental harms caused by the use of leaded gasoline at airports, and to expedite the transition to the use of unleaded aviation gasoline.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Airport" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 47.68.020.

2. "Airport operator" means a county, city, government agency, port district, or other person that owns or operates an airport.

3. "Aviation gasoline" means gasoline sold for use in an aircraft.

4. "Aviation retail establishment" means any public or private entity who sells aviation gasoline or offers or otherwise makes available aviation gasoline to a customer, including other businesses or government entities, for use in this state.

5. "Department" means the department of ecology.

6. "Leaded aviation gasoline" means aviation gasoline to which lead has been intentionally added.

7. "Unleaded aviation gasoline" means aviation gasoline to which no lead has been intentionally added.

## Section 3
1. Airport operators and aviation retail establishments are prohibited from selling, distributing, or otherwise making available to consumers leaded aviation gasoline consistent with the timeline specified in subsection (2) of this section.

2. The prohibitions on leaded aviation gasoline specified in subsection (1) of this section take effect:

    a. January 1, 2026, for airports and aviation retail establishments located:

        i. On or adjacent to a site identified for remediation under chapter 70A.305 RCW or under the federal cleanup law, as defined in RCW 70A.305.020;

        ii. In or adjacent to an overburdened community identified by the department under chapter 70A.02 RCW or an overburdened community highly impacted by air pollution identified by the department under RCW 70A.65.020(1); and

    c. January 1, 2030, for all other airports and aviation retail establishments.

## Section 4
1. The department, in consultation with the department of health and the department of transportation, must review available information, including publications by the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine, the United States environmental protection agency and United States federal aviation administration, and academic publications, to identify best management practices for reducing public health and environmental exposures to lead associated with airport operations. Based on this review, the department, in consultation with the department of health and the department of transportation, must publish initial guidance to airport operators on its website by July 1, 2024, regarding best airport operating practices to minimize environmental and public health impacts of lead exposures. The department must update its review and publish updated guidance under this section by July 1, 2026, and may periodically update its review and guidance thereafter.

2. In developing the guidance under subsection (1) of this section, the department must consider the inclusion of measures to:

    a. Manage run-up practices, including by increasing the distance between run-up areas and public areas on or off the airport, increasing the size of run-up areas;

    b. Eliminate the cast-off of leaded aviation gasoline and minimize and mitigate other spills and releases of unexpended leaded aviation gasoline;

    c. Minimize airport employee exposures;

    d. Minimize releases of leaded aviation gasoline caused by refueling and maintenance activities at the airport, including processes used to store and dispense aviation gasoline at the airport;

    e. Minimize idle time and engine run-up time; and

    f. Educate and financially incentivize airport fuel consumers that have the option to purchase and use unleaded aviation gasoline at the airport to do so.

## Section 5
1. By November 1, 2024, each airport operator must submit to the department and begin implementing a plan to implement best practices identified by the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine designed to minimize environmental impacts and public health risks associated with leaded aviation gasoline use at general aviation airports. Each airport operator must update its plan by the November 1st following an updated publication of the guidance issued under section 4 of this act. At a minimum, each airport operator must include in its plan:

    a. A description of how the airport operator plans to implement the operational and logistical recommendations contained in the guidance issued under section 4 of this act; and

    b. A plan and budget for the financing of any needed fueling infrastructure improvements at the airport to allow for the airport to begin supplying unleaded aviation gasoline by:

        i. January 1, 2026, for airports and aviation retail establishments located:

(A) On or adjacent to a site identified for cleanup under chapter 70A.305 RCW or under the federal cleanup law, as defined in RCW 70A.305.020;

(B) In or adjacent to an overburdened community identified by the department under chapter 70A.02 RCW or an overburdened community highly impacted by air pollution identified by the department under RCW 70A.65.020(1); and

(C) Primarily in a city with a population of at least 700,000 as of January 1, 2023, as determined using the population statistics published by the office of financial management;

        ii. January 1, 2028, for airports and aviation retail establishments located within or immediately adjacent to an urban growth area designated under RCW 36.70A.110;

        iii. January 1, 2030, for all other airports and aviation retail establishments.

2. By December 1, 2025, and each December 1st thereafter, each airport operator must provide a status report to the department regarding its implementation of the plan under this section, including the status of planning and investments to facilitate the supply of unleaded aviation gasoline at the airport.

3. The requirements of this section do not apply to the operator of an airport at which leaded aviation gasoline is not sold, distributed, or otherwise made available. An airport operator at which leaded aviation gasoline ceases to be sold, distributed, or otherwise made available must notify the department within 30 days of the cessation of the use of leaded aviation gasoline at the airport.

## Section 6
1. The department, in consultation with the department of transportation and the department of health, must offer technical assistance consistent with RCW 43.21A.085 and 43.21A.087 to a person that has not submitted a plan that meets the requirements of section 5 of this act or that does not implement the plan submitted to the department under section 5 of this act in the manner described in the plan.

2. The department may adopt rules to implement, administer, and enforce the requirements of this section. An air pollution control authority formed under chapter 70A.15 RCW must enforce the requirements of this chapter in areas within its jurisdiction and the department must enforce the requirements of this chapter in areas of the state in which no air pollution control authority has been formed under chapter 70A.15 RCW.
