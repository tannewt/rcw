<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall establish and administer a grant program to provide assistance to school districts for the personnel and other costs associated with applying for grants funded by the state of Washington and grants from other public or private sources for which the school district may be eligible.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;school districts&quot; include school districts, charter schools established under chapter 28A.710 RCW, and state-tribal education compact schools subject to chapter 28A.715 RCW.</p>
