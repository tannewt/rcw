The secretary of state shall distribute the voters' pamphlet to each household in the state, to public libraries, and to any other locations the secretary deems appropriate. The secretary of state shall also produce recorded or Braille transcripts of the voters' pamphlet, publicize their availability, and mail without charge a copy to any person who requests one.

The secretary of state may make the material required to be distributed by this chapter available to the public in electronic form. The secretary of state may provide the material in electronic form to web based, print, and broadcast news media and similar services at the cost of reproduction or transmission of the data.

## Section 2
No person or entity may publish or distribute any campaign material that is deceptively similar in design or appearance to a voters' pamphlet that was published by the secretary of state during the 10-year period before the publication or distribution of the campaign material by the person or entity. The secretary of state shall take reasonable measures to prevent or to stop violations of this section. Such measures may include, among others, petitioning the superior court for a temporary restraining order or other appropriate injunctive relief. In addition, the secretary may request the superior court to impose a civil fine on a violator of this section. The court is authorized to levy on and recover from each violator a civil fine not to exceed the greater of: (1) $5 for each copy of the deceptive material distributed, or (2) $10,000. In addition, the violator is liable for the state's legal expenses and other costs resulting from the violation. Any funds recovered under this section must be transmitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the general fund.

## Section 3

Committees must have the explanatory and fiscal impact statements available before preparing their arguments.

The initial two members may select up to four additional members, and the committee shall elect a chairperson. The remaining committee member or members may fill vacancies through appointment.

After the committee submits its initial argument statements to the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall transmit the statements to the opposite committee. The opposite committee may then prepare rebuttal arguments. Rebuttals may not interject new points.

The voters' pamphlet may contain only text argument statements prepared according to this section. Graphs, charts, photographs, cartoons, or caricatures are not permitted.

10. The full text of the measure.

## Section 6
1. All statements, arguments, and photographs submitted are subject to review and approval, and must conform to the criteria in this section. A statement or photograph may be rejected if in the opinion of the secretary of state any argument or statement offered for inclusion in the voters' pamphlet in support of or opposition to a measure or candidate does not comply with the standards contained in this section or administrative rules or contains obscene matter or matter that is otherwise prohibited by law from distribution through the mail. A person or committee that has submitted a statement or photograph rejected by the secretary may edit their statement or petition the superior court of Thurston county for a judicial determination that the photograph, argument, or statement complies with the standards and is acceptable for publication . The court shall not enter such an order unless it concludes that the matter is compliant, not obscene, or not otherwise prohibited for distribution through the mail. The court may award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to a person or committee who receives such an order.

2. Candidate statements may not:

    a. Ask for contributions; or

    b. Make commercial solicitations.

3. Statements and arguments submitted in support of or opposition to a measure, or in reply to the opposing statement, may not:

    a. Ask for contributions; or

    b. Make commercial solicitations.

4. A  statement submitted for inclusion in the voters' pamphlet shall not contain false or misleading statements that constitute libel or defamation per se. A false or misleading statement shall be considered "libel or defamation per se" if the statement tends to expose the opposition to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or to deprive him or her of the benefit of public confidence or social intercourse, or to injure him or her in his or her business or occupation. If a candidate believes his or her opponent has libeled or defamed him or her, the candidate may commence an action under subsection (5) of this section.

5. [Empty]

    a. A person who believes that he or she may be defamed by an argument or statement offered for inclusion in the voters' pamphlet in support of or opposition to a measure or candidate may petition the superior court of Thurston county for a judicial determination that the argument or statement may be rejected for publication or edited to delete the defamatory statement.

    b. The court shall not enter such an order unless it concludes that the statement is untrue and that the petitioner has a very substantial likelihood of prevailing in a defamation action.

    c. An action under this subsection (5) must be filed and served no later than the tenth day after the deadline for the submission of the argument or statement to the secretary of state.

    d. If the secretary of state notifies a person named or identified in an argument or statement of the contents of the argument or statement within three days after the deadline for submission to the secretary, then neither the state nor the secretary is liable for damages resulting from publication of the argument or statement unless the secretary publishes the argument or statement in violation of an order entered under this section. Nothing in this section creates a duty on the part of the secretary of state to identify, locate, or notify the person.

6. Parties to a dispute under this section may agree to resolve the dispute by rephrasing the argument or statement, even if the deadline for submission to the secretary has elapsed, unless the secretary determines that the process of publication is too far advanced to permit the change. The secretary shall promptly provide any such revision to any committee entitled to submit a rebuttal argument. If that committee has not yet submitted its rebuttal, its deadline to submit a rebuttal is extended by five days. If it has submitted a rebuttal, it may revise it to address the change within five days of the filing of the revised argument with the secretary.

7. In an action under this section the committee or candidate must be named as a defendant, and may be served with process by certified mail directed to the address contained in the secretary's records for that party. The secretary of state shall be a nominal party to an action brought under subsection (5) of this section, solely for the purpose of determining the content of the voters' pamphlet. The superior court shall give such an action priority on its calendar.

## Section 7
1. The maximum number of words for statements submitted by candidates is as follows: State representative, 100 words; state senator, judge of the superior court, judge of the court of appeals, justice of the supreme court, and all state offices voted upon throughout the state, except that of governor, 200 words; president and vice president, United States senator, United States representative, and governor, 300 words.

If the required appearance in a county's voters' pamphlet of the offices or measures of a unit of local government would create undue financial hardship for the unit of government, the legislative authority of the unit may petition the legislative authority of the county to waive this requirement. The legislative authority of the county may provide such a waiver if it does so not later than 60 days before the publication of the pamphlet and it finds that the requirement would create such hardship.

If a city, town, or district is located within more than one county, all appropriate information for that jurisdiction must appear in the local voters' pamphlet for each of the counties containing the jurisdiction. Arguments, candidate statements, and photographs must be submitted to the county auditor of the county that accepted any resolutions or candidate filings for that jurisdiction. The auditor that receives this information shall provide it to the other county auditors after reviewing and accepting the submissions.
