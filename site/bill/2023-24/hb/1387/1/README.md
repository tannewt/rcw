[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1387.pdf)

## Section 1
1. By January 1, 2025, the commission shall establish a program to recruit, and issue certifications to, a pool of candidates who may be hired as peace officers by city and county law enforcement agencies in the state.

2. When recruiting candidates to participate in the pool, the commission shall utilize best human resources practices to produce an applicant pool with a broad spectrum of backgrounds and experience.

3. To be eligible to participate in the pool established in this section, an applicant must meet the same requirements as a person who has received a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, including a background check under RCW 43.101.095.

4. Once an applicant is accepted into the pool, the applicant shall successfully complete basic law enforcement training and may be certified by the commission under this chapter. For purposes of prioritizing training availability, the commission shall treat a pool applicant the same as an applicant with a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency.

5. The commission may utilize contractors to meet the requirements of this section to the extent allowed by law.

## Section 2
1. The following types of city or county law enforcement agencies may issue an offer of employment to any applicant who is participating in the pool established in section 1 of this act:

    a. A law enforcement agency for a city with a population of less than 100,000; or

    b. A county law enforcement agency for a county with a population of less than 300,000.

2. A city or county law enforcement agency may issue an offer of employment to a pool applicant at any time, including prior to the applicant successfully completing basic law enforcement training. An offer of employment to an applicant prior to the applicant's successful completion of basic law enforcement training shall be considered to be a conditional offer of employment for purposes of this chapter and does not affect the requirement that the applicant successfully complete the training prior to certification. After an applicant is hired by a law enforcement agency under this subsection, the applicant is considered an employee of the law enforcement agency for purposes of this chapter.

3. A law enforcement agency employing a peace officer under this section shall reimburse the commission for the per capita costs of training that officer in an amount established in rule by the commission. When calculating the per capita training costs for purposes of this subsection, the commission may not include costs it has incurred in establishing the program under section 1 of this act.
