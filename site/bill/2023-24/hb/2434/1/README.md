# HB 2434 - Fish and wildlife commission

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2434.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that our government's first promise to uphold the rights of tribal members to hunt and fish in their traditional territories began with the treaties in the 1850s. The Boldt decision further solidified these rights by affirming the tribes' entitlement to 50 percent of the available fishery resources. This allocation ensures a balance, allowing tribal and nontribal members, including sport and commercial hunters and fishers, access to abundant opportunities for fishing and hunting. Today, the fish and wildlife commission is tasked with fulfilling the state's commitment to hunters and fishers in Washington. The fish and wildlife commission's mission, as outlined in their legislative mandate, is to "maximize fishing, hunting, and outdoor recreational opportunities compatible with healthy and diverse fish and wildlife populations." They have failed to live up to their purpose. They have made decisions contrary to the promises they and those that have come before them have made. They have ignored the science and their own staff, letting special interests dictate the department of fish and wildlife's direction and ignoring legislated mandates.

2. The legislature further finds that Washington state has a rich fishing and hunting culture for both tribal and nontribal people that is deeply intertwined with the state's history. These traditions often include rituals, stories, and values that bind communities together, fostering a deep appreciation for nature and the responsible use and stewardship of natural resources. It is imperative that the legislature take decisive action to preserve this valuable culture and prevent it from being lost due to broken promises.

3. The legislature intends to dissolve the fish and wildlife commission and entrust the department of fish and wildlife to a director who will uphold Washington state's promises to its citizens. This new structure will allow the state to keep its commitment to managing a diverse and robust ecosystem, thereby ensuring the continued legacy of the people of the state.

## Section 2
