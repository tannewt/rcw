<li>
<p>Agreement by the tribe that, at the request of the criminal justice training commission, the tribe will make available any records the tribe has provided to the department of retirement systems as required under the reporting, contribution, and auditing requirements defined in this chapter or chapter 41.50 RCW, and rules implementing those chapters;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreement by the tribe to a limited waiver of sovereign immunity and consent to the jurisdiction of the Washington state courts for the purpose of enforcing the reporting, contribution, and auditing requirements defined in this chapter and all rules adopted under authority of RCW 41.50.050(5), including RCW 41.26.062;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreement by the tribe to dissolution procedures memorialized in the state-tribal compact so that all parties are aware of their expectations and duties if the compact terminates or the tribal law enforcement agency chooses to no longer participate in the state retirement systems at a future date, specifically including withdrawal liability and examples of the scale of withdrawal liability for an employer with a tribal law enforcement agency similar in size to the tribe memorializing the compact;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acknowledgment by the tribe that it has been advised that choosing to no longer participate in the retirement systems may result in federal tax implications for the governing body and its employees that are outside the control of the state of Washington, the department of retirement systems, and that the tribe has been encouraged to seek counsel before agreeing to any dissolution procedures in the compact; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acknowledgment by both parties that the pension system participation portions of the state-tribal compact are null and void if the federal internal revenue service issues guidance stating that any portion of those sections are in conflict with the plan qualification requirements for governmental plans in section 401(a) of the internal revenue code, and the conflict cannot be resolved through administrative action, statutory change, or amendment to the state-tribal compact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For tribes that opt out of pension system participation, such tribal law enforcement employees shall have no right to earn additional service credit in the plan.</p>

<li>
<p>Port districts established under Title 53 RCW , institutions of higher education as defined in RCW 28B.10.016, and tribal governments participating through a state-tribal compact as defined in section 2 of this act shall contribute both the employer and state shares of the cost of the retirement system for any of their employees who are law enforcement officers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Institutions of higher education shall contribute both the employer and the state shares of the cost of the retirement system for any of their employees who are firefighters.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>When an employer charges a fee or recovers costs for work performed by a plan member where:</p>
<pre><code>a. The member receives compensation that is includable as basic salary under RCW 41.26.030(4)(b); and

b. The service is provided, whether directly or indirectly, to an entity that is not an &quot;employer&quot; under RCW 41.26.030(14)(b);

<li>
<p>A member who is employed as a law enforcement officer with the police department of the government of a federally recognized tribe on July 1, 2025, may establish credit for such service rendered prior to July 1, 2025, unless service is either already credited for those periods, or a member was in receipt of retirement benefits from any retirement system listed in RCW 41.50.030. Upon receipt of a written request, the department of retirement systems must notify the member of the cost to establish credit for all or part of such service. Service credit may only be established for periods prior to July 1, 2025, if that service meets the requirements of RCW 41.26.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before July 1, 2026, a member may elect to establish credit in plan 2 under this section. Such election must be filed in writing with the department of retirement systems by June 30, 2026. The elected period must be in monthly increments beginning with the oldest service.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To establish service under this section, the member must pay the actuarial value of the resulting increase in their benefit in a manner defined by the department: (i) No later than five years from the effective date of the election made under this section; and (ii) prior to retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon full payment of employee contributions for the elected period of service the department of retirement systems must credit the member with the service.</p>
