<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds and declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Since 2013, the legislature has supported the research, development, and demonstration of innovative clean energy technologies through the clean energy fund program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clean energy fund program provides a benefit to the public consistent with the state energy strategy and clean energy and climate mandates established in chapters 19.405 and 70A.65 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State funding allocated to the clean energy fund program has catalyzed public-private partnerships and has accelerated innovation in clean energy technologies. However, market transformation is still in its early stages and requires continued state investment to equitably and affordably meet the state's clean energy goals that require fundamental shifts in Washington's energy landscape and infrastructure needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clean energy fund program aligns with federal programs and can provide matching funds to help leverage greater investment in clean energy projects in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state must provide resources and technical assistance to enable communities in Washington to benefit from state and federal funding for clean energy projects, shape their own energy future, and realize the benefits of clean energy projects, such as community resilience, environmental justice, and high road jobs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is created within the department the clean energy fund program to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program is intended to fund projects that provide a benefit to the public through research, development, and demonstration of innovative clean energy technologies that save energy and reduce energy costs, reduce harmful air emissions, or increase energy independence for the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects eligible for assistance from the program must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Support clean energy technologies and infrastructure and be consistent with the state energy strategy adopted under chapter 43.21F RCW, with clean energy and climate mandates established in chapters 19.405 and 70A.65 RCW, and with environmental justice goals established in RCW 70A.02.060; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address decarbonization of the use of energy in all sectors of the economy, which can include, but is not limited to, research, development, and demonstration to support new clean energy technologies, first of a kind projects to demonstrate how clean energy technologies can be integrated into the unique Washington energy ecosystem, and introduction of emerging clean energy technologies into new communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must develop funding opportunities in partnership with communities throughout the state. Funding may be utilized to address community identified clean energy challenges and accelerate market transformation of new technology solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to grants for installation and construction, the department may use moneys provided for the program to provide technical assistance to eligible applicants planning for a clean energy project that is eligible for program funding. This assistance may include predesign, design, and engineering work that is anticipated to lead to a capital asset. The department may contract with outside consultants, nonprofit organizations, and other qualified entities to provide this technical assistance. As part of providing technical assistance, the department or a contracted organization or organizations may provide any of the following services:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Project design, architectural planning, and engineering;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may use funds appropriated to the program as match to secure federal investments that align with the state energy strategy adopted under chapter 43.21F RCW and accelerate achievement of clean energy and climate mandates established in chapters 19.405 and 70A.65 RCW.</p>
</li>
