# HB 2388 - Clean energy fund

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2388.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds and declares that:

1. Since 2013, the legislature has supported the research, development, and demonstration of innovative clean energy technologies through the clean energy fund program.

2. The clean energy fund program provides a benefit to the public consistent with the state energy strategy and clean energy and climate mandates established in chapters 19.405 and 70A.65 RCW.

3. State funding allocated to the clean energy fund program has catalyzed public-private partnerships and has accelerated innovation in clean energy technologies. However, market transformation is still in its early stages and requires continued state investment to equitably and affordably meet the state's clean energy goals that require fundamental shifts in Washington's energy landscape and infrastructure needs.

4. The clean energy fund program aligns with federal programs and can provide matching funds to help leverage greater investment in clean energy projects in Washington.

5. The state must provide resources and technical assistance to enable communities in Washington to benefit from state and federal funding for clean energy projects, shape their own energy future, and realize the benefits of clean energy projects, such as community resilience, environmental justice, and high road jobs.
