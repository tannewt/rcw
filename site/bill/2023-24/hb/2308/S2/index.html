<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that through tax incentives, the private market can assist Washington in meeting its housing goals, allowing the state to focus its resources on serving households making below 50 percent of the area median income. Furthermore, by providing adequate housing stock for households making 50 to 80 percent of the area median income, those households will not compete with persons in lower-income brackets for more affordable units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that constructing new housing units can take years, and many existing buildings can be repurposed quickly to meet the state's workforce and affordable housing needs. Many existing buildings are located in downtown centers, near work and services where there is limited land available for new construction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many downtown centers lack available affordable housing, which results in long commutes that increase greenhouse gas emissions. The legislature recognizes that by using existing buildings to create affordable housing units, units can be available more quickly and with a reduced impact on waste streams and the environment compared to newly constructed units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to incentivize the repurposing of existing buildings for workforce and affordable housing by creating a property tax shift and a sales and use tax remittance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislative authority of a city to which this chapter applies may authorize a sales and use tax deferral for commercial building conversions within the city if the legislative authority of the city finds that the conversion fulfills the requirements of this chapter. If a conditional recipient maintains the property for qualifying purposes for at least 10 years, deferred sales and use taxes need not be repaid.</p>

<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in chapter . . ., Laws of 2024 (this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>

<p>The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to incentivize the repurposing of existing buildings for affordable housing.</p>

<li>
<p>It is the legislature's intent to provide a deferral from sales and use taxes qualifying under chapter 82.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 17 of this act) for the conversion of commercial buildings into affordable housing units for low-income households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to measure the effectiveness of these tax preferences in achieving the public policy objective described in this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.</p>
