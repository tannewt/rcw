# HB 2308 - Existing structures/housing

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2308.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that through tax incentives, the private market can assist Washington in meeting its housing goals, allowing the state to focus its resources on serving households making below 50 percent of the area median income. Furthermore, by providing adequate housing stock for households making 50 to 80 percent of the area median income, those households will not compete with persons in lower income brackets for more affordable units.

2. The legislature also finds that constructing new housing units can take years, and many existing buildings can be repurposed quickly to meet the state's workforce and affordable housing needs. Many existing buildings are located in downtown centers, near work and services where there is limited land available for new construction.

3. The legislature finds that many downtown centers lack available affordable housing, which results in long commutes that increase greenhouse gas emissions. The legislature recognizes that by using existing buildings to create affordable housing units, units can be available more quickly and with a reduced impact on waste streams and the environment compared to newly constructed units.

4. It is the intent of the legislature to incentivize the repurposing of existing buildings for workforce and affordable housing by creating a property tax shift and a sales and use tax remittance.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Affordable housing" means:

    a. Residential rental housing that is rented by a person or household whose monthly housing costs, including utilities other than telephone, do not exceed 30 percent of the required household monthly area median income to qualify as a low-income household under this chapter.

    b. Residential homeownership housing that is owned or occupied by a low-income household whose monthly housing costs do not exceed the percentage of family income that may be spent on monthly housing costs, including utilities other than telephone, established by the department of commerce.

2. "Area median income" means:

    a. For an area within a standard metropolitan statistical area, the area median income reported by the United States department of housing and urban development for that standard metropolitan statistical area; or

    b. For an area not within a standard metropolitan statistical area, the county median income reported by the department of commerce.

3. "Governing authority" means the legislative authority of a city having jurisdiction over the property for which an exemption may be applied under this chapter.

2. A city governing authority may by ordinance or resolution establish a state and local property tax exemption program for property owners for the value of real property that consists of a commercial building converted from a commercial building to a multiunit residential building and contains affordable housing units for low-income households, excluding land and nonhousing-related improvements not qualifying under this chapter.

## Section 4

## Section 6
To be eligible for the property tax exemptions under this chapter, in addition to any other requirements in this chapter, the property must be in compliance with the following for the entire exemption period:

    a. For residential conversions, a minimum of 30 percent of residential units in a multiunit residential building subject to a tax exemption under this chapter must be rented or sold as affordable housing units to low-income households for a period no less than 30 years. Transitioning units to be rented or sold as affordable housing units is not an acceptable reason for a landlord to evict a tenant, consistent with RCW 59.18.650. Units must be transitioned to serve low-income households through natural turnover. The tax exemption under this chapter does not apply until the minimum number of units under this section have been rented or sold as affordable housing units to low-income households. A governing authority may require that more than 30 percent of the units in multifamily housing buildings be affordable housing to address local market conditions. Up to and including the midpoint, the percentage requirement may be rounded down to the nearest whole number of units.

    b. For commercial conversions, a minimum of 20 percent of residential units in a multiunit residential building subject to a tax exemption under this chapter must be rented or sold as affordable housing units to low-income households for a period no less than 30 years to address local market conditions. Up to and including the midpoint, the percentage requirement may be rounded down to the nearest whole number of units.

2. For any units within the multiunit residential building that are rented to low-income households at the time of the exemption application, the units must remain as affordable housing and are additive to the percentage of units required to be affordable housing under this section.

3. Affordable housing units must be distributed throughout the building and be comparable in terms of quality, living conditions, size, and mix of unit types to market rate units in the building.

## Section 7
An owner of property must meet the following requirements to receive an exemption under this chapter:

    b. For residential conversions, documentation that indicates the units in the building were rented at over 80 percent area median income prior to conversion to affordable housing by providing the average rent charged to tenants from the previous two years as well as the anticipated amount of time needed to transition units to serving low-income households;

    c. A floor plan of units and other information requested;

    d. A statement that the applicant is aware of the potential tax liability involved when the property ceases to be eligible for the exemption provided under this chapter; and

    e. A certification of family size and annual income requirements in a form acceptable to the city for designated affordable housing units.

2. Applications should be processed within 30 days of submittal to facilitate project financing.

3. [Empty]

    a. If the application is approved, the designated administrative official or agent must issue the owner a conditional certificate of tax exemption. The certificate must contain a statement specifying that the applicant complies with the requirements of section 7 of this act. The city and applicant must enter into a contract stipulating that a tax exemption will be provided if the applicant complies with the provisions outlined in the conditional certificate of tax exemption.

    b. Within two years of the issuance of the conditional certificate of exemption, the applicant shall submit information indicating that it has complied with the terms of the conditional certificate of tax exemption. The applicant can apply to the governing authority for an extension of an additional 12 months to receive a final certificate of tax exemption.

    c. Within 30 days of receipt of the statement required under (b) of this subsection (3), the governing authority's designated administrative official or agent must determine whether the affordability of the units is consistent with the conditional certificate of tax exemption. If the authorized representative of the city determines that the affordability is consistent with the contract issued with the conditional certificate of tax exemption, the city must file a final certificate of tax exemption with the county assessor within 10 days of such determination.

4. If the application is denied, the designated administrative official or agent must state in writing the reasons for denial and issue notice to the applicant by regular or certified mail to the applicant's last known address, or by other means reasonably calculated to provide notice, within 10 days of the denial.

5. An applicant may appeal the decision of the designated administrative official or agent within 30 days after receipt. The appeal must be based upon the record made before the administrative official or agent, and the burden is on the applicant to show that the decision is not supported by substantial evidence.

## Section 9
1. The owner receiving a tax exemption under this chapter must obtain from each tenant living in a designated affordable housing unit an annual certification of family size and annual income in a form acceptable to the governing authority.

2. The owner must file an annual report with the governing authority's designated administrative official or agent indicating the following:

    c. The number and type of units meeting affordable housing requirements;

    d. The total monthly rent amount for each affordable and market rate unit; and

    e. The dollar amount of the tax exemption issued for each conversion and the total dollar amount of tax exemptions granted within the city.

## Section 10
1. Real property exempted under this chapter continue to be exempted for the applicable period under section 5 of this act if the improvements continue to satisfy all applicable conditions. If the owner intends to discontinue compliance with the affordable housing requirements as described in section 5 of this act or any other condition to the exemption, the owner must notify tenants and the jurisdiction 60 days before the owner's discontinuance. If the city is notified by the owner, or if the city discovers that a portion of the property no longer meets the qualifications of the tax exemption, the tax exemption is canceled, and the following must occur:

    a. Additional real property tax must be imposed on the property. This additional tax is the difference between the property tax paid and the property tax that would have been paid if the property had included the value of the nonqualifying improvements, for each of the prior 10 years during which the exemption was in effect;

    b. Additional interest is owed upon the amounts of the additional property tax at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes, calculated from the dates on which the additional tax would have been payable without the tax exemption;

    c. A penalty is owed in the amount equal to 20 percent of the additional property tax imposed under this section; and

    d. The additional tax, interest, and penalty are a lien on the real property and attach at the time the property or portion of the property is removed from exempted status. The lien has priority to, and must be fully paid and satisfied before, a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the land may become charged or liable, except that the lien is of equal rank with liens for amounts deferred under chapter 84.37 or 84.38 RCW. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent ad valorem property taxes.

2. Upon a determination that a tax exemption is to be canceled for a reason stated in this section, the governing authority or designated administrative official or agent of the governing authority must notify the taxpayer, shown by the tax rolls by certified mail, and the assessor, of the determination to cancel the tax exemption. The owner may appeal the determination within 30 days of the date of the notice by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the governing authority, specifying the factual and legal basis upon which the determination of cancellation is alleged to be erroneous. The governing authority or designated administrative official or agent may hear the appeal. At the hearing, all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that the governing authority's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. After the hearing, the decision maker must affirm, modify, or overturn the decision to cancel the tax exemption based on the evidence received. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the deciding body or officer to the superior court. The governing authority must also notify the assessor of the final disposition of the appeal.

3. The assessor must annually value the exempt and nonexempt portions of the property and improvements as necessary to permit the correction of the rolls in accordance with this section.

## Section 11
If the owner intends to convert any affordable housing rental units to market rate units before the 30-year exemption period or after the exemption period ends, the owner must provide tenants of affordable housing rental units with notification of intent to provide the tenant with rental relocation assistance. The owner must provide tenant relocation assistance in an amount equal to one month's rent to a low-income household within the final month of the low-income household's lease. To be eligible for tenant relocation assistance under this section, the tenant must occupy an affordable housing unit at the time the exemption expires and must qualify as a low-income household under this section at the time relocation assistance is sought.
