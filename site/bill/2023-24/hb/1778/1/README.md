[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1778.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington state is the most trade focused state in the nation. International trade and investment is responsible for one-fifth of private sector jobs in Washington. Washington is the fourth largest exporter in the United States, and the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area is the third largest exporting metropolitan area. Almost 90 percent of the 12,000 companies that export from Washington were small and medium-sized businesses.

The legislature further finds that Washington's trade focus has advantages and disadvantages. Washington's trade focus provides job and income growth opportunities during times of peace, but also great economic risk in the event of geopolitical disruption. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that the department of commerce increase its planning and assistance for diversifying export markets for Washington businesses.

## Section 2
The department shall report to the legislature by July 1, 2024, on the anticipated economic impacts in Washington state in the event of a major disruption to trade with any of Washington's historic top trading partners, and make policy recommendations on how the department could be equipped to provide business assistance to impacted exporters and their employees in Washington. The report must include a description of current efforts to diversify Washington state trade relationships and decrease reliance on any one particular trading partner.

In carrying out these responsibilities, the department shall prioritize diversifying foreign export destinations and eliminate economic dependence on any particular foreign market.

2. The department shall identify and work with Washington businesses that can use local, state, and federal assistance to increase domestic and foreign exports of goods and services. In carrying out this responsibility, the department shall prioritize diversifying foreign export destinations and eliminate economic dependency on any particular foreign market.

This assistance shall include but not be limited to assisting in workforce training and infrastructure needs, identifying and locating suitable business sites, and resolving problems with government licensing and regulatory requirements. The department shall identify gaps in needed services and develop steps to address them including private sector support and purchase of these services.

4. The department shall work to increase the availability of capital to small businesses by developing new and flexible investment tools; by assisting in targeting and improving the efficiency of existing investment mechanisms; and by assisting in the procurement of managerial and technical assistance necessary to attract potential investors.

5. The department shall assist women and minority-owned businesses in overcoming barriers to entrepreneurial success. The department shall contract with public and private agencies, institutions, and organizations to conduct entrepreneurial training courses for minority and women-owned businesses. The instruction shall be intensive, practical training courses in financing, marketing, managing, accounting, and recordkeeping for a small business, with an emphasis on federal, state, local, or private programs available to assist small businesses.
