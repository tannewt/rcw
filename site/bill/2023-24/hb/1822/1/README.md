The annual permit fee is $75. A single permit applies to all rental properties owned or operated by a short-term rental operator and identified in the permit application.

2. Upon application in the prescribed form being made to any employee authorized by the board to issue permits, accompanied by payment of the prescribed fee, and upon the employee being satisfied that the applicant should be granted a permit under this section, the employee must issue to the applicant under such regulations as may be prescribed by the board a permit under this section.
