# HB 1085 - Plastic pollution

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1085-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to reduce unnecessary plastic waste and sources of plastic pollution in the environment, especially where less-polluting and more sustainable alternatives to plastic products and packaging are available. In this act, the legislature intends to reduce three such sources of plastic and associated pollution:

1. Single-use plastic water bottles, which frequently end up as litter;

2. The small plastic containers, wrappers, and packaging for personal health and beauty products, which are still often provided in lodging establishments but easily substituted by bulk dispensers and which are difficult to recycle in current systems; and

3. Certain thin-walled or soft-shell floating extruded or expanded plastic foam structures, which frequently degrade in the environment and contribute to small and microplastic pollution of marine and shoreline environments.

## Section 2
1. In any construction subject to the requirements of this chapter in which a drinking fountain is required under the international building code as amended and adopted by the building code council, the rules adopted by the building code council must also require the provision of a bottle filling station, or a combined bottle filling station and drinking fountain for each drinking fountain that is required.

2. The rules required under this section must take effect and be implemented by July 1, 2026, and may be periodically updated thereafter.

3. For the purposes of this section, "bottle filling station" means a plumbing fixture connected to the potable water distribution system and sanitary drainage system that is designed and intended for filling personal use drinking water bottles or containers not less than 10 inches (254 millimeters) in height. A bottle filling station may be separate from or integral to a drinking fountain and may incorporate a water filter and a cooling system for chilling the drinking water.

## Section 3
1. Beginning January 1, 2024, it is prohibited to sell, distribute, install, or arrange for the installation of in or into Washington state:

    a. Overwater structures containing expanded or extruded plastic foam that is not fully enclosed and contained in a shell made of plastic with a minimum thickness of 0.15 inches, concrete, aluminum, or steel; and

    b. Blocks or floats containing or comprised of expanded or extruded plastic foam that are not fully enclosed and contained in a shell made of plastic with a minimum thickness of 0.15 inches, concrete, aluminum, or steel, and that are intended for use in or in conjunction with overwater structures.

    d. Penalties issued under this section are appealable to the pollution control hearings board established in chapter 43.21B RCW.

3. For the purposes of this section, overwater structures do not include floating homes or floating on-water residences, as those terms are defined in RCW 90.58.270, but do include docks, floats, walkways, or other accessory overwater structures associated with floating homes or floating on-water residences.
