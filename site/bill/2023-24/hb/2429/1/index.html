<li>
<p>The council shall receive all applications for energy facility site certification, provided that such applications contain sufficient information for the council to complete its evaluation of all potential impacts under chapter 43.21C RCW, the state environmental policy act. If an application does not contain sufficient information for the council to make a threshold determination required by RCW 43.21C.030, the application must be rejected and not processed until such information is submitted. Each applicant shall pay actual costs incurred by the council in processing an application.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each applicant shall, at the time of application submission, pay to the council for deposit into the energy facility site evaluation council account created in RCW 80.50.390 an amount up to $50,000, or such greater amount as specified by the council after consultation with the applicant. The council shall charge costs against the deposit if the applicant withdraws its application and has not reimbursed the council for all actual expenditures incurred in considering the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The council may commission its own independent consultant study to measure the consequences of the proposed energy facility on the environment or any matter that it deems essential to an adequate appraisal of the site. The council shall provide an estimate of the cost of the study to the applicant and consider applicant comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the deposit required under (a) of this subsection, applicants must reimburse the council for actual expenditures that arise in considering the application, including the cost of any independent consultant study. The council shall submit to each applicant an invoice of actual expenditures made during the preceding calendar quarter in sufficient detail to explain the expenditures. The applicant shall pay the council the amount of the invoice by the due date.</p>

<p>Prior to the issuance of a council recommendation to the governor under RCW 80.50.100 a public hearing, conducted as an adjudicative proceeding under chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act, shall be held. Such an adjudicative proceeding may not be commenced until the council has completed its environmental analysis under chapter 43.21C RCW, including the issuance of a final environmental impact statement when applicable.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At such public hearing any person shall be entitled to be heard in support of or in opposition to the application for certification by raising one or more specific issues, provided that the person has raised the issue or issues in writing with specificity during the application review process or during the public comment period that will be held prior to the start of the adjudicative hearing. A person's right to be heard in support of or in opposition to the application for certification includes the right to call any witness with relevant information, without limitation by a witness's personal or professional affiliation or employment, except for the councilmembers or council staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the environmental impact of the proposed facility in an application for certification is not significant or will be mitigated to a nonsignificant level under RCW 43.21C.031, the council may limit the topic of the public hearing conducted as an adjudicative proceeding under this section to whether any land use plans or zoning ordinances with which the proposed site is determined to be inconsistent under subsection (2) of this section should be preempted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After expedited processing is granted under RCW 80.50.075, the council must hold a public meeting to take comments on the proposed application prior to issuing a council recommendation to the governor.</p>
