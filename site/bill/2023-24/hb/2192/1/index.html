<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes the importance of fostering lifelong civic engagement and that there is an opportunity to align Washington state with the national voting rights day celebrations and activities, both benefiting teachers and improving the civic engagement of high school students. The legislature recognizes that moving some activities from January 16th to the third Tuesday in September allows for teachers to incorporate civic education lessons and voter registration activities closer to the November general election. Therefore, the legislature intends to align Washington state with national civic engagement activities by celebrating national voter registration day.</p>
