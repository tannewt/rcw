2. In addition to the requirements in subsection (1) of this section, a nonresident vessel owner that is not a natural person, or a nonresident vessel owner who is a natural person who intends to charter the vessel with a captain or crew as provided in subsection (1)(b)(ii) of this section, may only obtain a nonresident vessel permit if:

3. A nonresident vessel permit:

    a. May be obtained from the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director;

    b. Must show the date the vessel first came into Washington state; and

    c. Is valid for two months.

4. The department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director must collect the fee required in RCW 88.02.640(1)(i) when issuing nonresident vessel permits.

5. A nonresident vessel permit is not required under this section if the vessel is used in conducting temporary business activity within Washington state.

6. For any permits issued under this section to a nonresident vessel owner that is not a natural person, or for any permits issued to a natural person who intends to charter the vessel with a captain or crew as provided in subsection (1)(b)(ii) of this section, the department must maintain a record of the following information and provide it to the department of revenue quarterly or as otherwise mutually agreed to by the department and department of revenue:

    a. The name of the record owner of the vessel;

    b. The vessel's hull identification number;

    c. The amount of the fee paid under RCW 88.02.640(5);
