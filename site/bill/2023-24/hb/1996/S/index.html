<p>The notice must state all reasons for the proposed termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal and must further state that if, within 30 days following receipt of the notice, the dealer provides to the manufacturer or distributor a written notice of intent to cure all claimed deficiencies, the dealer will then have 120 days following receipt of the notice to rectify the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are rectified within 120 days, the manufacturer's or distributor's notice is voided. If the dealer fails to provide the notice of intent to cure the deficiencies in the prescribed time period, the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal takes effect 30 days after the dealer's receipt of the notice unless the dealer has new and untitled inventory on hand that may be disposed of pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.</p>

<li>
<p>A dealer may terminate, cancel, or not renew a model, line-make, or the entire manufacturer/dealer agreement with a manufacturer or distributor with or without good cause at any time by giving 30 days written notice to the manufacturer.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All new, untitled recreational vehicles that were acquired from the manufacturer or distributor within 18 months before the date of the notice of termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal that have not been used, except for demonstration purposes, and that have not been altered or damaged, at 100 percent of the net invoice cost, including transportation, less applicable rebates and discounts to the dealer. If any of the recreational vehicles repurchased are damaged, the amount due to the dealer shall be reduced by the cost to repair the damaged recreational vehicle. Damage prior to delivery to the dealer will not disqualify repurchase under this subsection. Any repurchased recreational vehicle must be paid in full before the vehicle is removed from the dealer's premises. Upon payment, the recreational vehicle must be immediately surrendered to the manufacturer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All undamaged accessories and proprietary parts sold to the dealer for resale within the 12 months prior to termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, if accompanied by the original invoice, at 105 percent of the original net price paid to the manufacturer or distributor to compensate the dealer for handling, packing, and shipping the parts; and</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A dealer is not prohibited from selling the remaining in-stock inventory of a particular line-make after a manufacturer/dealer agreement has been terminated, canceled, or not renewed by the manufacturer or distributor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If recreational vehicles of a line-make subject to the terminated manufacturer/dealer agreement are not repurchased or required to be repurchased by the manufacturer or distributor, the dealer may continue to sell such recreational vehicles that are subject to the terminated manufacturer/dealer agreement and are currently in stock until those recreational vehicles are no longer in the dealer's inventory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When taking on an additional line-make of a recreational vehicle, a dealer shall notify in writing any manufacturer with whom the dealer has a manufacturer/dealer agreement of the same line-make at least 30 days prior to entering into a manufacturer/dealer agreement with the manufacturer of the additional line-make.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The warrantor shall disapprove warranty claims in writing within 45 days after the date of submission by the dealer in the manner and form prescribed by the warrantor.

<p>Fail to perform predelivery inspection functions, as specified by the warrantor, in a competent and timely manner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to perform warranty service work authorized by the warrantor in a reasonably competent and timely manner on any transient customer's vehicle of the same line-make unless the dealer determines that the customer is acting in a manner detrimental to its business;</p>

<p>The service of a demand for mediation under this subsection stays the time for the filing of any complaint, petition, protest, or action under this chapter until representatives of both parties have met with a mutually selected mediator for the purpose of attempting to resolve the dispute. If a complaint, petition, protest, or action is filed before that meeting, the court shall enter an order suspending the proceeding or action until the meeting has occurred and may, upon written stipulation of all parties to the proceeding or action that they wish to continue to mediate under this subsection, enter an order suspending the proceeding or action for as long a period as the court considers appropriate. A suspension order issued under this subsection may be revoked by the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parties to the mediation shall bear their own costs for attorneys' fees and divide equally the cost of the mediator.</p>
</li>

<p>In addition to the remedies provided in this section and notwithstanding the existence of any additional remedy at law, a dealer or manufacturer may apply to a superior court for the grant, upon a hearing and for cause shown, of a temporary or permanent injunction, or both, restraining any person from acting as a dealer, manufacturer, or distributor without being properly licensed pursuant to this chapter, from violating or continuing to violate any of the provisions of this chapter, or from failing or refusing to comply with the requirements of this chapter. Such injunction shall be issued without bond. A single act in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is sufficient to authorize the issuance of an injunction.</p>
