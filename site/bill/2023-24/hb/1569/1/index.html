<li>
<p>Any borrowing by an association that is to be secured by an assignment of the association's right to receive future income pursuant to subsection (2)(e) and (p) of this section requires ratification by the unit owners as provided in this subsection.</p>

<p>If a tenant of a unit owner violates the governing documents, in addition to exercising any of its powers against the unit owner, the association may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Exercise directly against the tenant the powers described in subsection (2)(l) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After giving notice to the tenant and the unit owner and an opportunity to be heard, levy reasonable fines against the tenant and unit owner for the violation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforce any other rights against the tenant for the violation that the unit owner as the landlord could lawfully have exercised under the lease or that the association could lawfully have exercised directly against the unit owner, or both; but the association does not have the right to terminate a lease or evict a tenant unless permitted by the declaration. The rights referred to in this subsection (5)(c) may be exercised only if the tenant or unit owner fails to cure the violation within 10 days after the association notifies the tenant and unit owner of that violation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless a lease otherwise provides, this section does not:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Affect rights that the unit owner has to enforce the lease or that the association has under other law; or</p>

<li>
<p>Permit the association to enforce a lease to which it is not a party in the absence of a violation of the governing documents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board may determine whether to take enforcement action by exercising the association's power to impose sanctions or commencing an action for a violation of the governing documents, including whether to compromise any claim for unpaid assessments or other claim made by or against it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board does not have a duty to take enforcement action if it determines that, under the facts and circumstances presented:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The association's legal position does not justify taking any or further enforcement action;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The covenant, restriction, or rule being enforced is, or is likely to be construed as, inconsistent with law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although a violation may exist or may have occurred, it is not so material as to be objectionable to a reasonable person or to justify expending the association's resources; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not in the association's best interests to pursue an enforcement action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board's decision under subsections (7) and (8) of this section to not pursue enforcement under one set of circumstances does not prevent the board from taking enforcement action under another set of circumstances, but the board may not be arbitrary or capricious in taking enforcement action.</p>
