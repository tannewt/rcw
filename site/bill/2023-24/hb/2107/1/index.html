<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that hunting has been an integral aspect of tribal life for generations, serving as a cornerstone of cultural identity, spiritual connection, and survival. Native communities in Washington have passed down the art of hunting from elders to youth, instilling essential skills, knowledge, and values associated with sustainable living and the responsible stewardship of the land. The process of teaching hunting skills to native children has been a time-honored tradition, fostering a deep respect for nature and instilling a sense of responsibility for the well-being of the community. This intergenerational transfer of knowledge is not merely a survival skill but an essential component of tribal heritage, preserving a way of life that has sustained communities in harmony with the natural world for centuries. In the Pacific Northwest, hunting has played a pivotal role in shaping the history of tribal nations. The expertise of native hunters in navigating the diverse ecosystems of the region has contributed significantly to the sustenance and resilience of their communities. Traditional hunting practices have not only provided a vital food source but also served as a means of trade, fostering cultural exchange and strengthening social bonds among tribes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to provide free hunting licenses to tribal members. In doing so, the legislature not only honors the legacy of native hunters, but also contributes to the continuity of traditional practices, ensuring that future generations can inherit and carry forward the wisdom that hunting provides.</p>
