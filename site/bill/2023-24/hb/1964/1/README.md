## Section 1
Provisions and terms used in this chapter have the meaning given to them in the international registration plan (IRP), in chapter 46.04 RCW, or as otherwise defined in this section. Definitions given to terms by the IRP prevail unless given a different meaning in this chapter or in rules adopted under authority of this chapter.

1. "Adequate records" are records maintained by the owner of the fleet sufficient to enable the department to verify the distances reported in the owner's application for apportioned registration and to evaluate the accuracy of the owner's distance accounting system.

6. "Declared gross weight" means the total unladen weight of any vehicle plus the maximum weight of the load to be carried on the vehicle as declared by the registrant. In the case of a bus, auto stage, or a passenger-carrying for hire vehicle with a seating capacity of more than six, the declared gross weight is determined by multiplying 150 pounds by the number of seats in the vehicle, including the driver's seat, and adding this amount to the unladen weight of the vehicle. If the resultant gross weight is not listed in RCW 46.17.355, it must be increased to the next higher gross weight authorized in chapter 46.44 RCW.

7. "Department" means the department of licensing.

8. "Fleet" means one or more apportionable vehicles.

14. "Person" means any individual, partnership, association, public or private corporation, limited liability company, or other type of legal or commercial entity, including its members, managers, partners, directors, or officers.

15. "Prorate percentage" is the factor applied to the total proratable fees and taxes to determine the apportionable fees required for registration in a jurisdiction. It is determined by dividing the in-jurisdiction distance for a particular jurisdiction by the total distance.

16. "Registrant" means a person, business, or corporation in whose name or names a vehicle or fleet of vehicles is registered.

17. "Registration year" means the 12-month period during which the credentials issued by the base jurisdiction are valid.

18. "Reporting period" means the period of 12 consecutive months immediately prior to July 1st of the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the registration year for which apportioned registration is sought.
