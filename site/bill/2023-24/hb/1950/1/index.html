An institution of higher education shall not treat any adjusted total hours worked differently from hours worked without an adjustment when determining whether an employee is full time. &quot;Institution of higher education&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;institutions of higher education&quot; in RCW 28B.10.016.</p>
