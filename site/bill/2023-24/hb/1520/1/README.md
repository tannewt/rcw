# HB 1520 - Fentanyl

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1520.pdf)

## Section 1
According to a recent study of provisional data collected by the United States centers for disease control and prevention, overdose from fentanyl is now the leading cause of death of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Washington is not immune from the opioid epidemic. Fentanyl has had a staggering effect on its communities, and fentanyl-related overdoses are increasing across the state. Under current law, possession of fentanyl is classified as a simple misdemeanor, which is the lowest criminal penalty available, and on July 1st of this year, the current law provision will expire and Washington will return to its former law, which has been deemed unconstitutional. This is an insufficient criminal justice system response to this extremely dangerous drug. The legislature intends to fix the constitutional defect in the law going forward and restore the felony penalties that were previously in place for possession of fentanyl in order to reflect the extreme hazards associated with this highly potent substance. Additionally, the legislature intends to launch a public outreach campaign to enhance public education on this issue and connect affected individuals with available resources.

## Section 2
1. It is unlawful for any person to possess a controlled substance unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the course of his or her professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by this chapter.

        i. One-half ounce of useable cannabis;

        ii. Eight ounces of cannabis-infused product in solid form;

        iii. Thirty-six ounces of cannabis-infused product in liquid form; or

        i. The delivery must be done in a location outside of the view of general public and in a nonpublic place; or

        ii. The cannabis or cannabis product must be in the original packaging as purchased from the cannabis retailer.

5. No person under 21 years of age may possess, manufacture, sell, or distribute cannabis, cannabis-infused products, or cannabis concentrates, regardless of THC concentration. This does not include qualifying patients with a valid authorization.
