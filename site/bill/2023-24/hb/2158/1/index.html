<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the supply of developable land for housing needs to be increased. To do so without increasing the costs on local governments, the legislature intends to direct cities and counties to expand urban growth area boundaries so that any parcel that shares a common boundary with, or is located across the road from, a residential parcel with access to urban services can be developed for residential purposes.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By the next comprehensive plan update required under RCW 36.70A.130, a city or county planning under this chapter must expand its urban growth area boundaries to include all parcels that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Share a common boundary with another parcel that: (i) Shares a common boundary with an urban growth area boundary; (ii) is developed for residential purposes or has been approved for residential development by the county; and (iii) has access to urban services or is in an area where the county plans to provide urban services; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are adjacent to a road along which an urban growth area boundary is drawn where parcels on the opposite side of the road: (i) Are within the urban growth area; (ii) are developed for residential purposes or have been approved for residential development by the county; and (iii) have access to urban services or are in an area where the county plans to provide urban services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a parcel that meets the criteria in subsection (1) of this section, a city or county must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Authorize residential development at the same density as allowed on the types of parcels described in subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow any buildings that are part of a residential development to use and connect to any available urban services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall designate an urban growth area or areas within which urban growth shall be encouraged and outside of which growth can occur only if it is not urban in nature. Each city that is located in such a county shall be included within an urban growth area. Each parcel that meets the criteria in section 2(1) of this act shall be included within an urban growth area. An urban growth area may include more than a single city. An urban growth area may include territory that is located outside of a city only if such territory already is characterized by urban growth whether or not the urban growth area includes a city, or is adjacent to territory already characterized by urban growth, or is a designated new fully contained community as defined by RCW 36.70A.350. When a federally recognized Indian tribe whose reservation or ceded lands lie within the county or city has voluntarily chosen to participate in the planning process pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040, the county or city and the tribe shall coordinate their planning efforts for any areas planned for urban growth consistent with the terms outlined in the memorandum of agreement provided for in RCW 36.70A.040(8).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based upon the growth management population projection made for the county by the office of financial management, the county and each city within the county shall include areas and densities sufficient to permit the urban growth that is projected to occur in the county or city for the succeeding 20-year period, except for those urban growth areas contained totally within a national historical reserve. As part of this planning process, each city within the county must include areas sufficient to accommodate the broad range of needs and uses that will accompany the projected urban growth including, as appropriate, medical, governmental, institutional, commercial, service, retail, and other nonresidential uses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each urban growth area shall permit urban densities and shall include greenbelt and open space areas. In the case of urban growth areas contained totally within a national historical reserve, the city may restrict densities, intensities, and forms of urban growth as determined to be necessary and appropriate to protect the physical, cultural, or historic integrity of the reserve. An urban growth area determination may include a reasonable land market supply factor and shall permit a range of urban densities and uses. In determining this market factor, cities and counties may consider local circumstances. Cities and counties have discretion in their comprehensive plans to make many choices about accommodating growth.</p>
<p>Within one year of July 1, 1990, each county that as of June 1, 1991, was required or chose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, shall begin consulting with each city located within its boundaries and each city shall propose the location of an urban growth area. Within 60 days of the date the county legislative authority of a county adopts its resolution of intention or of certification by the office of financial management, all other counties that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall begin this consultation with each city located within its boundaries. The county shall attempt to reach agreement with each city on the location of an urban growth area within which the city is located. If such an agreement is not reached with each city located within the urban growth area, the county shall justify in writing why it so designated the area an urban growth area. A city may object formally with the department over the designation of the urban growth area within which it is located. Where appropriate, the department shall attempt to resolve the conflicts, including the use of mediation services.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Urban growth should be located first in areas already characterized by urban growth that have adequate existing public facility and service capacities to serve such development, second in areas already characterized by urban growth that will be served adequately by a combination of both existing public facilities and services and any additional needed public facilities and services that are provided by either public or private sources, and third in the remaining portions of the urban growth areas. Urban growth may also be located in designated new fully contained communities as defined by RCW 36.70A.350.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general, cities are the units of local government most appropriate to provide urban governmental services. In general, it is not appropriate that urban governmental services be extended to or expanded in rural areas except :</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In those limited circumstances shown to be necessary to protect basic public health and safety and the environment and when such services are financially supportable at rural densities and do not permit urban development; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When necessary for residential development of a parcel that meets the criteria in section 2(1) of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or before October 1, 1993, each county that was initially required to plan under RCW 36.70A.040(1) shall adopt development regulations designating interim urban growth areas under this chapter. Within three years and three months of the date the county legislative authority of a county adopts its resolution of intention or of certification by the office of financial management, all other counties that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall adopt development regulations designating interim urban growth areas under this chapter. Adoption of the interim urban growth areas may only occur after public notice; public hearing; and compliance with the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW, and under this section. Such action may be appealed to the growth management hearings board under RCW 36.70A.280. Final urban growth areas shall be adopted at the time of comprehensive plan adoption under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each county shall include designations of urban growth areas in its comprehensive plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An urban growth area designated in accordance with this section may include within its boundaries urban service areas or potential annexation areas designated for specific cities or towns within the county.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the expansion of an urban growth area is prohibited into the 100-year floodplain of any river or river segment that: (i) Is located west of the crest of the Cascade mountains; and (ii) has a mean annual flow of 1,000 or more cubic feet per second as determined by the department of ecology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsection (8)(a) of this section does not apply to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Urban growth areas that are fully contained within a floodplain and lack adjacent buildable areas outside the floodplain;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urban growth areas where expansions are precluded outside floodplains because:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Urban governmental services cannot be physically provided to serve areas outside the floodplain; or</p>
<p>(B) Expansions outside the floodplain would require a river or estuary crossing to access the expansion; or</p>
<pre><code>    iii. Urban growth area expansions where:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Public facilities already exist within the floodplain and the expansion of an existing public facility is only possible on the land to be included in the urban growth area and located within the floodplain; or</p>
<p>(B) Urban development already exists within a floodplain as of July 26, 2009, and is adjacent to, but outside of, the urban growth area, and the expansion of the urban growth area is necessary to include such urban development within the urban growth area; or</p>
<p>(C) The land is owned by a jurisdiction planning under this chapter or the rights to the development of the land have been permanently extinguished, and the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>(I) The permissible use of the land is limited to one of the following: Outdoor recreation; environmentally beneficial projects, including but not limited to habitat enhancement or environmental restoration; stormwater facilities; flood control facilities; or underground conveyances; and</p>
<p>(II) The development and use of such facilities or projects will not decrease flood storage, increase stormwater runoff, discharge pollutants to fresh or salt waters during normal operations or floods, or increase hazards to people and property.</p>
<pre><code>c. For the purposes of this subsection (8), &quot;one hundred year floodplain&quot; means the same as &quot;special flood hazard area&quot; as set forth in WAC 173-158-040 as it exists on July 26, 2009.
</code></pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>If a county, city, or utility has adopted a capital facility plan or utilities element to provide sewer service within the urban growth areas during the 20-year planning period, nothing in this chapter obligates counties, cities, or utilities to install sanitary sewer systems to properties within urban growth areas designated under subsection (2) of this section by the end of the 20-year planning period when those properties:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Have existing, functioning, nonpolluting on-site sewage systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a periodic inspection program by a public agency to verify the on-site sewage systems function properly and do not pollute surface or groundwater; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have no redevelopment capacity; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not require sewer service because development densities are limited due to wetlands, floodplains, fish and wildlife habitats, or geological hazards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1)(a) Each comprehensive land use plan and development regulations shall be subject to continuing review and evaluation by the county or city that adopted them. Except as otherwise provided, a county or city shall take legislative action to review and, if needed, revise its comprehensive land use plan and development regulations to ensure the plan and regulations comply with the requirements of this chapter according to the deadlines in subsections (4) and (5) of this section.</p>
