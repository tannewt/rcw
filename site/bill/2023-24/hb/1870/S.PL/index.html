<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington ranks poorly among all states in the amount of federal grants received relative to income taxes collected from its residents.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that many of Washington's communities, particularly in slow-growing rural areas, face an economic development &quot;chicken and egg&quot; dilemma in which they need to secure matching dollars in order to obtain federal economic development dollars that would increase the local tax base, local revenue, and local employment and incomes.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that recent federal legislation provides funding for economic development clusters that Washington state has invested in as part of its economic development strategy, including broadband and clean energy, buildings, and transportation. The federal legislation includes the infrastructure investment and jobs act, P.L. 117-58, the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors and science act, P.L. 117-167, and the inflation reduction act, P.L. 117-169.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that increasing the availability of federal grant dollars in local communities provides a benefit of a reasonably general character to a significant part of the public.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to continue and expand its efforts to increase the capacity of the department of commerce to assist local communities in successfully applying for federal grant dollars including through providing local communities with state matching funds for securing federal grants.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
