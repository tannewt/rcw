<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to improve protections for pedestrians and other vulnerable roadway users from motor vehicles that pose an increased safety risk to them through consumer and public education, as well as through enhanced enforcement penalties for traffic infractions that pose a particular risk of dire consequences for pedestrians and other vulnerable roadway users in the event of a collision with such a vehicle.</p>
<p>Larger motor vehicles cause more severe injuries when they strike pedestrians, bicyclists, and other motorists due to their heavier weight. A vehicle sitting at a greater height with a long hood will have larger front blind spots that could prevent its driver from seeing a small child or someone in a wheelchair directly in front of it. Vehicles with straight, block front grilles that strike a pedestrian's pelvis or chest immediately after the bumper hits the pedestrian's lower extremities can also transfer more energy to a pedestrian's body, increasing the severity of injury. Many pickup trucks and midsize and large sport utility vehicles are more dangerous to pedestrians and other vulnerable roadway users because they are heavier and sit at a significantly greater height than sedans and have straight, block front grilles.</p>
<p>The legislature believes that, to protect pedestrians and vulnerable roadway users from the increased risk of severe injury and death, it is imperative to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Warn consumers considering purchasing certain pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles of this increased risk;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the total monetary penalties imposed on the driver of certain pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles when traffic infractions that pose a greater danger to pedestrians and vulnerable roadway users in the event of a collision are committed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate the public and drivers of certain pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles of the increased risk these vehicles pose to pedestrians and vulnerable roadway users through public education campaigns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Midsize or large sport utility vehicle&quot; means a motor vehicle with a scale weight of 4,000 pounds or more that is designated as a sport utility vehicle by the manufacturer.</p>

<li>
<p>A dealer may charge the documentary service fee in (a) of this subsection under the following conditions:</p>

The disclosure must be written in a typeface that is at least as large as the typeface used in the standard text of the document that contains the disclosure and that is bold faced, capitalized, underlined, or otherwise set out from the surrounding material so as to be conspicuous. The dealer shall not represent to the purchaser or lessee that the fee or charge is required by the state to be paid by either the dealer or prospective purchaser or lessee;</p>

Tender may be conditioned on return of the subject vehicle if previously delivered to the buyer or lessee.</li>

    ii. Substantial physical damage or latent mechanical defect occurring before the dealer took possession of the vehicle and which could not have been reasonably discoverable at the time of the taking of the order, offer, or contract; or

    iii. Excessive additional miles or a discrepancy in the mileage. &quot;Excessive additional miles&quot; means the addition of 500 miles or more, as reflected on the vehicle's odometer, between the time the vehicle was first valued by the dealer for purposes of determining its trade-in value and the time of actual delivery of the vehicle to the dealer. &quot;A discrepancy in the mileage&quot; means (A) a discrepancy between the mileage reflected on the vehicle's odometer and the stated mileage on the signed odometer statement; or (B) a discrepancy between the mileage stated on the signed odometer statement and the actual mileage on the vehicle; or

<p>For a buyer's agent to arrange for or to negotiate the purchase, or both, of a new motor vehicle through an out-of-state dealer without disclosing in writing to the customer that the new vehicle would not be subject to chapter 19.118 RCW. This subsection also applies to leased vehicles. In addition, it is unlawful for any buyer's agent to fail to have a written agreement with the customer that: (a) Sets forth the terms of the parties' agreement; (b) discloses to the customer the total amount of any fees or other compensation being paid by the customer to the buyer's agent for the agent's services; and (c) further discloses whether the fee or any portion of the fee is refundable.</p>

Good faith is defined as the duty of each party to any franchise to act in a fair and equitable manner towards each other, so as to guarantee one party freedom from coercion, intimidation, or threats of coercion or intimidation from the other party: PROVIDED, That recommendation, endorsement, exposition, persuasion, urging, or argument are not deemed to constitute a lack of good faith;</p>

<p>Nothing in this section may be construed to impair the obligations of a contract or to prevent a manufacturer, distributor, representative, or any other person, whether or not licensed under this chapter, from requiring performance of a written contract entered into with any licensee hereunder, nor does the requirement of such performance constitute a violation of any of the provisions of this section if any such contract or the terms thereof requiring performance, have been freely entered into and executed between the contracting parties.

A manufacturer or new motor vehicle dealer is not required to disclose to a dealer or buyer that glass, tires, bumpers, or cosmetic parts of a new motor vehicle were damaged at any time if the damaged item has been replaced with original or comparable equipment. A replaced part is not part of the cumulative damage required to be disclosed under this subsection.</p>

<p>The state of Washington advises consumers considering the purchase or lease of a vehicle of this make and model that larger vehicles cause more severe injuries when they strike pedestrians, bicyclists, and other motorists due to their heavier weight. A vehicle sitting at a greater height with a long hood will have larger front blind spots that could prevent its driver from seeing a small child or someone in a wheelchair directly in front of it.
