School districts that have more than 200 enrolled students must meet the requirements of this section through in-person instruction.

2. Instruction in cardiopulmonary resuscitation under this section must:

    a. Be an instructional program developed by the American heart association or the American red cross or be nationally recognized and based on the most current national evidence‑based emergency cardiovascular care guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation;

    b. Include appropriate use of an automated external defibrillator; and

    c. Incorporate hands‑on practice in addition to cognitive learning.
