    e. "Wildfire risk model" means any tool, instrumentality, means or product, including but not limited to a map-based tool, a computer-based tool, or a simulation, that is used by an insurer, in whole or in part, to measure or assess the wildfire risk associated with a residential or commercial structure for purposes of:

        i. Classifying individual structures according to their wildfire risk; or

        ii. Estimating losses corresponding to such wildfire risk classifications.

    f. "Wildfire risk score" means the numerical representation of wildfire risk resulting from the deployment of a wildfire risk model.

2. Any insurer that takes adverse action against a consumer based in whole or in part on the use of a wildfire risk model must include the following information in the written notice required under RCW 48.18.290 or 48.18.2901, or in a separate written notice to the consumer if notice is not otherwise required:

    a. What wildfire risk model or models were used and from which company or companies the models were provided;

The insurer is responsible for ensuring that the reason or reasons for the adverse action are written in reasonably clear and simple language, even if the reason or reasons are provided to the insurer by a vendor of a wildfire risk model. In all circumstances it is not sufficient for an insurer to state that an insured does not meet the insurer's underwriting standards.

        ii. If a consumer appeals the wildfire risk score, the insurer shall acknowledge receipt of the appeal in writing within 10 calendar days of receipt of the appeal.

        iii. An insurer must respond to an appeal in writing with a reconsideration and decision within 30 calendar days after receiving the appeal, and the reconsideration and decision must demonstrate that the insurer reviewed and considered any new information provided by the consumer under (f)(i) of this subsection.

        i. The wildfire risk score associated with each adverse action;

        ii. The actual reason the insurer took the adverse action, in accordance with subsection (2) of this section; and

        iii. The wildfire risk models used and the vendor providing the wildfire risk model; and

    c. The total number, if any, of wildfire risk mitigation discounts or credits provided to a consumer as permitted under Section 11 of this act.

Nothing in this section prohibits the commissioner from preparing and publishing reports, analyses, or other documents using the data received under this section so long as the data is in aggregate form and does not permit the identification of information related to individual companies. Data in the aggregate form are deemed open records available for public inspection. Nothing in the section affects, limits, or amends the commissioner's authority under chapter 48.37 RCW.

## Section 3
The strengthen Washington homes program is hereby established within the office of the insurance commissioner.

## Section 4
1. The commissioner shall establish by rule a process whereby homeowners in Washington state may apply to receive a grant administered by the commissioner under this chapter to:

    a. Retrofit an insurable property to mitigate against damage caused by wildfire in a manner not otherwise provided for by state law, rule, or program;

    b. Inspect an insurable residential property to certify that it meets the wildfire prepared home standards; or

    c. Achieve both subsections (a) and (b) of this subsection.

3. An eligible contractor or eligible evaluator chosen by an applicant to complete the work described in subsection (1) of this section is prohibited from beginning work until a grant is approved.

4. In order to assure equitable distribution of grants in proportion to the income demographics in counties where the program is made available, all verified applicants must be placed in the order the application was received and grant applications must be accepted and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. The commissioner may establish pilot projects as needed to establish a sustainable program distribution system in any geographic area within the state.

5. The commissioner may obtain grants or other money from the federal government or other funding sources to support and enhance program activities.

6. The commissioner must regularly coordinate with other state agencies including the department of natural resources to ensure that grants awarded under this section are not duplicative of wildfire mitigation and related efforts undertaken by other state agencies.

## Section 5
1. After a grant application is approved:

    a. An eligible contractor selected by a homeowner may begin the mitigation work permitted by the scope of the grant application approved by the commissioner. Once the mitigation work is completed, the eligible contractor must submit a copy of the signed contract between the contractor and homeowner to the commissioner, along with an invoice seeking payment.

    b. An eligible evaluator must conduct evaluations to either:

        i. Confirm that the work completed under (a) of this subsection was accomplished according to the applicable mitigation specifications; or

        ii. Confirm that a residential property has met the wildfire prepared home standard. Once an evaluation is completed, an evaluator must submit a report to the commissioner of the property's condition, an invoice seeking payment, and an affidavit stating whether the property meets the wildfire prepared standards.

2. The commissioner or a designee must, on behalf of the homeowner, directly pay the eligible contractor that performed the mitigation work or the eligible evaluator, the costs covered by the grant from the strengthen Washington homes account created in section 9 of this act.

3. A project funded by a grant under this chapter must be completed within six months of the date the grant is approved. Failure to complete the project in a timely manner may result in forfeiture of the grant.

## Section 7
1. This chapter does not create an entitlement for property owners or obligate the state of Washington to pay for residential property in Washington to be inspected or retrofitted.

2. All mitigation under this chapter is contingent upon securing all required local permits and applicable inspections to comply with local building codes and applicable wildfire prepared home standards. A mitigation project receiving a grant under this chapter is subject to random reinspection at a later date.

## Section 8
The commissioner may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer this chapter including, but not limited to:

1. Rules on criteria used to determine whether an applicant is eligible for a grant under this chapter;

2. Rules on standards to determine whether a contractor is eligible to work on a project funded by a grant under this chapter; and

3. Rules on standards to determine whether an evaluator is eligible to work on a project funded by a grant under this chapter.

## Section 9
The strengthen Washington homes account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the premium tax in RCW 48.14.020(1)(c) must be deposited in the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the strengthen Washington homes program.

## Section 10

Such gross underwriting profit shall be ascertained by deducting from the net premiums (i.e., gross premiums less all return premiums and premiums for reinsurance) on such ocean marine and foreign trade insurance contracts the net losses paid (i.e., gross losses paid less salvage and recoveries on reinsurance ceded) during such calendar year under such contracts. In the case of insurers issuing participating contracts, such gross underwriting profit shall not include, for computation of the tax prescribed by this subsection, the amounts refunded, or paid as participation dividends, by such insurers to the holders of such contracts.

5. The state does hereby preempt the field of imposing excise or privilege taxes upon insurers or their appointed insurance producers, other than title insurers, and no county, city, town or other municipal subdivision shall have the right to impose any such taxes upon such insurers or these insurance producers.

6. If an authorized insurer collects or receives any such premiums on account of policies in force in this state which were originally issued by another insurer and which other insurer is not authorized to transact insurance in this state on its own account, such collecting insurer shall be liable for and shall pay the tax on such premiums.
