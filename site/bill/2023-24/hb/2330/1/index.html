<li>
<p>&quot;Adverse action&quot; means cancellation, denial, or nonrenewal of property insurance or general casualty insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Consumer&quot; means an individual policyholder or applicant for insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;General casualty insurance&quot; has the meaning in RCW 48.11.070.</p>
</li>

<p>&quot;Property insurance&quot; has the meaning in RCW 48.11.040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Wildfire risk model&quot; means any tool, instrumentality, means or product, including but not limited to a map-based tool, a computer-based tool, or a simulation, that is used by an insurer, in whole or in part, to measure or assess the wildfire risk associated with a residential or commercial structure for purposes of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Classifying individual structures according to their wildfire risk; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimating losses corresponding to such wildfire risk classifications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Wildfire risk score&quot; means the numerical representation of wildfire risk resulting from the deployment of a wildfire risk model.</p>

The insurer is responsible for ensuring that the reason or reasons for the adverse action are written in reasonably clear and simple language, even if the reason or reasons are provided to the insurer by a vendor of a wildfire risk model. In all circumstances it is not sufficient for an insurer to state that an insured does not meet the insurer's underwriting standards.
