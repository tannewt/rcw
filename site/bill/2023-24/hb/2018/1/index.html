<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that student use of mobile devices in schools has had a multitude of negative effects on student outcomes. Mobile devices can be a constant distraction that disrupts the learning environment for all students. According to a study from the London School of Economics, and replicated by other researchers, the mere presence of a smartphone by a neighboring student lowers a nonphone student's test performance by about six percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that mobile devices can increase harm to students' mental health either by recording students without consent or through increased cyberbullying. Washington students are still recovering from the massive effects of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including severe learning loss and troubling trends in student mental health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to combat these effects with safer and more engaging learning environments for students. While the United States and nations around the world consider restricting mobile devices for students, the Washington legislature intends to explore the best strategies to implement a phone free school environment with more focus on academics, development of social skills, and students engaging with each other, through research and analysis of information collected from pilot schools. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to restrict student use of mobile devices in public schools during instructional hours using the strategy or strategies recommended by the office of the superintendent of public instruction, beginning in the 2027-28 school year.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Survey administrators, teachers, students, and families for their perceptions of the benefits and detriments of the student mobile device restrictions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report to the office of the superintendent of public instruction with the survey results, student outcome data, and other information related to implementing the student mobile device restrictions.</p>

</li>
<li>
