<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The trucking industry is vital to Washington state's economy. In order to make the flow of goods by the trucking industry possible, there must be appropriate infrastructure to accommodate the needs of the men and women who drive and work on the trucks, and to service the trucks themselves. Some local governments in Washington have not planned sufficiently for those needs or have erected barriers to developing such infrastructure. The joint transportation committee has received recommendations in a truck parking action plan. The action plan includes immediate actions to have governments build parking, provide incentives to build truck parking in high-demand areas, and have governments plan for truck parking and other necessary facilities. The legislature intends for this act to promote action to increase these much needed facilities.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As part of the safety policy goal established in RCW 47.04.280(1), the department must establish a plan for the department and other state agencies to facilitate the establishment and operation of commercial truck parking located near interstate highways, ports, and other areas that generate significant amounts of commercial truck trips. This plan should include proposals for public investment in truck parking as well as recommending or providing incentives for nonpublic investment in such parking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the years 2023 to 2030, the department must annually report to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature on the known increases to commercial truck parking near Interstates 2, 5, and 90, and any of the ports. The department must reach out to local governments, ports, and a state association representing commercial trucking companies when preparing the report.</p>

Commercial truck parking facilities should include restrooms, showers, equipment to facilitate idle reduction allowing for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and electric services to be powered from on-site, and security measures. Some locations should be collocated, abutting, or very near restaurants and grocery stores that can accommodate commercial trucks with trailers.</p>
