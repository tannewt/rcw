<p>The legislature finds that to further enhance accountability, promote public trust and confidence in law enforcement, and increase community safety, sheriffs, whether elected or appointed, police chiefs, marshals, and reserve officers must meet the same standards for background checks, certification, training, and other provisions of chapter 43.101 RCW as are required for all other peace officers, and the use of volunteers must be prescribed.</p>

<li>
<p>As a condition of employment, all Washington peace officers, including sheriffs, marshals, police chiefs, and reserve officers, and all corrections officers, are required to obtain certification  and maintain certification as required by this chapter and the rules of the commission. For the purposes of this section, &quot;peace officer&quot; means a general authority Washington peace officer as defined in RCW 10.93.020, which includes sheriffs, marshals, and police chiefs, and &quot;reserve officer&quot; means a type of specially commissioned Washington peace officer, defined in RCW 10.93.020 as an individual who is an officer of a Washington law enforcement agency who does not serve such agency on a full-time basis, but who, when called by the agency into active service, is fully commissioned on the same basis as full-time peace officers to enforce the criminal laws of the state.</p>

The airport operator may require the rental car companies to collect the facility charges, and any facility charges so collected shall be deposited in a trust account for the benefit of the airport operator and remitted at the direction of the airport operator, but no more often than once per month. The charge shall be calculated on a per-day basis. Facility charges may not exceed the reasonable costs of financing, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the consolidated car rental facilities and common use transportation equipment and facilities and may not be used for any other purpose. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(g), if an airport operator makes use of its own funds to finance the consolidated rental car facilities and common use transportation equipment and facilities, the airport operator (i) is entitled to earn a rate of return on such funds no greater than the interest rate that the airport operator would pay to finance such facilities in the appropriate capital market, provided that the airport operator establish the rate of return in consultation with the rental car companies, and (ii) may use the funds earned under (g)(i) of this subsection for purposes other than those associated with the consolidated rental car facilities and common use transportation equipment and facilities.

h. To make airport property available for less than fair market rental value under very limited conditions provided that prior to the lease or contract authorizing such use the airport operator's board, commission, or council has (i) adopted a policy that establishes that such lease or other contract enhances the public acceptance of the airport and serves the airport's business interest and (ii) adopted procedures for approval of such lease or other contract.

    i. If the airport operator has adopted the policy and procedures under (h) of this subsection, to lease or license the use of property belonging to the municipality and acquired for airport purposes at less than fair market rental value as long as the municipality's council, board, or commission finds that the following conditions are met:

    i. The lease or license of the subject property enhances public acceptance of the airport in a community in the immediate area of the airport;

    ii. The subject property is put to a desired public recreational or other community use by the community in the immediate area of the airport;

    iii. The desired community use and the community goodwill that would be generated by such community use serves the business interest of the airport in ways that can be articulated and demonstrated;

    iv. The desired community use does not adversely affect the capacity, security, safety, or operations of the airport;

v. At the time the community use is contemplated, the subject property is not reasonably expected to be used by an aeronautical tenant or otherwise be needed for airport operations in the foreseeable future;

vi. At the time the community use is contemplated, the subject property would not reasonably be expected to produce more than de minimis revenue;

vii. If the subject property can be reasonably expected to produce more than de minimis revenue, the community use is permitted only where the revenue to be earned from the community use would approximate the revenue that could be generated by an alternate use;

viii. Leases for community use must not preclude reuse of the subject property for airport purposes if, in the opinion of the airport owner, reuse of the subject property would provide greater benefits to the airport than continuation of the community use;

    ix. The airport owner ensures that airport revenue does not support the capital or operating costs associated with the community use;

x. The lease or other contract for community use is not to a for‑profit organization or for the benefit of private individuals;

xi. The lease or other contract for community use is subject to the requirement that if the term of the lease is for a period that exceeds 10 years, the lease must contain a provision allowing for a readjustment of the rent every five years after the initial 10-year term;

xii. The lease or other contract for community use is subject to the requirement that the term of the lease must not exceed 50 years; and

However, the municipality's board, council, or commission may waive the rent security requirement or lower the amount of the rent security requirement for good cause.
