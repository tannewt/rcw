# HB 2287 - Corrections ombuds adv board

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2287-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature created the office of the corrections ombuds to serve as an independent and impartial entity to provide oversight, monitoring, and investigation into issues arising within the state's prisons. It was also created to help strengthen procedures and practices that promote the health, safety, welfare, and rehabilitation of incarcerated individuals and reduce the exposure of the department of corrections to litigation. To ensure that the office's work remains focused on addressing the needs of currently incarcerated people, the legislature hereby creates an advisory board composed of community stakeholders, including current and formerly incarcerated people, to provide advice and feedback to the ombuds.
