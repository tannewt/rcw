# HB 2391 - County ferries

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2391-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Any county may construct, condemn, or purchase, operate and maintain ferries or wharves at any unfordable stream, lake, estuary or bay within or bordering on said county, or between portions of the county, or between such county and other counties, together with all the necessary boats, grounds, roads, approaches, and landings appertaining thereto under the direction and control of the board of county commissioners free or for toll and as the board shall by resolution determine.

2. County ferry maintenance shall be exempt from the requirements of chapter 39.04 RCW for contracting compliance purposes. Maintenance, including inspections and repairs required by United States coast guard regulations to renew the annual certificate of inspection of a county, either by itself or together with other counties that operate county ferries, may use an indefinite-quantity contract.

3. For the purposes of this section, "an indefinite-quantity contract" means a contract pertaining to county ferry repair and maintenance that provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of  supplies  or services during a fixed period not exceeding 10 years for the maintenance or repair of a county ferry vessel. The county places orders for individual requirements. Quantity limits  may  be stated as number of units or as dollar values.

    a.  The contract  must  require the county to order and the contractor to furnish at least a stated minimum quantity of  supplies  or services. In addition, if ordered, the contractor  must  furnish any additional quantities, not to exceed the stated maximum. The  contracting officer  should  establish a reasonable maximum quantity based on  market research, trends on recent contracts for similar  supplies  or services, survey of potential users, or any other rational basis.

    b.  To ensure that the contract is binding, the minimum quantity  must  be more than a nominal quantity, but it  should  not exceed the amount that the county is fairly certain to order.

    c.  The contract  may  also specify maximum or minimum quantities that the county  may  order under each task or  delivery order  and the maximum that it  may  order during a specific period of time. Contract performance bonds will be based on the minimum guaranteed quantities.
