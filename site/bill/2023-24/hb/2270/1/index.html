<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that affordable housing and homelessness have reached an unprecedented crisis level in Washington state. These issues are not isolated to any one part of our state, rather they are challenges being faced by every community across the state.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that in response to these challenges, the state has expanded the scope and authority of the department of commerce, which has diligently worked to introduce and grow programs to increase housing supply, incentivize and manage development, provide rental assistance, support housing providers, and shelter residents. The state recognizes and thanks the department for their efforts and commitment to Washington's residents.</p>
<p>As the crisis continues, the legislature finds a need for a more holistic approach to housing and homelessness issues and better alignment of state policies across agencies and in partnership with local jurisdictions and community-based programs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a new state department of housing that will focus solely on housing and homelessness issues and bring together state programs that currently span multiple agencies and partners. The legislature also intends to engage a professional consultant to help facilitate the transition of programs and identify gaps that may be filled by the new department. The legislature further intends to launch the department by July 2025 to reflect the urgency of the crisis and the state's continued role as a leader in the nation.</p>
