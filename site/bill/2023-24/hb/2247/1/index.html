<li>
<p>The authority shall ensure that publicly supported community health centers and providers in rural areas, who show serious intent and apparent capability to participate as managed care organizations are seriously considered as contractors. The authority shall coordinate its managed care activities with activities under chapter 70.47 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall work jointly with the state of Oregon and other states in this geographical region in order to develop recommendations to be presented to the appropriate federal agencies and the United States congress for improving health care of the poor, while controlling related costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that competition in the managed health care marketplace is enhanced, in the long term, by the existence of a large number of managed care organization options for medicaid clients. In a managed care delivery system, whose goal is to focus on prevention, primary care, and improved enrollee health status, continuity in care relationships is of substantial importance, and disruption to clients and health care providers should be minimized. To help ensure these goals are met, the following principles shall guide the authority in its healthy options managed health care purchasing efforts:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>All managed care organizations should have an opportunity to contract with the authority to the extent that minimum contracting requirements defined by the authority are met, at payment rates that enable the authority to operate as far below appropriated spending levels as possible, consistent with the principles established in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managed care organizations should compete for the award of contracts and assignment of medicaid beneficiaries who do not voluntarily select a contracting system, based upon:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Demonstrated commitment to or experience in serving low-income populations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality of services provided to enrollees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessibility, including appropriate utilization, of services offered to enrollees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrated capability to perform contracted services, including ability to supply an adequate provider network;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment rates; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>The ability to meet other specifically defined contract requirements established by the authority, including consideration of past and current performance and participation in other state or federal health programs as a contractor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consideration should be given to using multiple year contracting periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality, accessibility, and demonstrated commitment to serving low-income populations shall be given significant weight in the contracting, evaluation, and assignment process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a" start="5">
<li>
<p>All contractors that are regulated health carriers must meet state minimum net worth requirements as defined in applicable state laws. The authority shall adopt rules establishing the minimum net worth requirements for contractors that are not regulated health carriers. This subsection does not limit the authority of the Washington state health care authority to take action under a contract upon finding that a contractor's financial status seriously jeopardizes the contractor's ability to meet its contract obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures for resolution of disputes between the authority and contract bidders or the authority and contracting carriers related to the award of, or failure to award, a managed care contract must be clearly set out in the procurement document.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority may apply the principles set forth in subsection (5) of this section to its managed health care purchasing efforts on behalf of clients receiving supplemental security income benefits to the extent appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any contract with a managed care organization to provide services to medical assistance enrollees shall require that managed care organizations offer contracts to mental health providers and substance use disorder treatment providers to provide access to primary care services integrated into behavioral health clinical settings, for individuals with behavioral health and medical comorbidities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managed care organization contracts effective on or after April 1, 2016, shall serve geographic areas that correspond to the regional service areas established in RCW 74.09.870.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A managed care organization shall pay a nonparticipating provider that provides a service covered under this chapter or other applicable law to the organization's enrollee no more than the lowest amount paid for that service under the managed care organization's contracts with similar providers in the state if the managed care organization has made good faith efforts to contract with the nonparticipating provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For services covered under this chapter or other applicable law to medical assistance or medical care services enrollees, nonparticipating providers must accept as payment in full the amount paid by the managed care organization under subsection (9) of this section in addition to any deductible, coinsurance, or copayment that is due from the enrollee for the service provided. An enrollee is not liable to any nonparticipating provider for covered services, except for amounts due for any deductible, coinsurance, or copayment under the terms and conditions set forth in the managed care organization contract to provide services under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuant to federal managed care access standards, 42 C.F.R. Sec. 438, managed care organizations must maintain a network of appropriate providers that is supported by written agreements sufficient to provide adequate access to all services covered under the contract with the authority, including hospital-based physician services. The authority will monitor and periodically report on the proportion of services provided by contracted providers and nonparticipating providers, by county, for each managed care organization to ensure that managed health care systems are meeting network adequacy requirements. No later than January 1st of each year, the authority will review and report its findings to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature for the preceding state fiscal year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a managed care organization's provider network includes participating providers licensed under chapter 18.83 or 18.225 RCW, the plan may not categorically exclude associate licensees under those chapters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payments under RCW 74.60.130 are exempt from this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-19">Section 19 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-19">¶</a></h2>
<p>The health care authority shall ensure that all services provided by associate licenses under chapters 18.225 and 18.83 RCW are included in the state medicaid program, including filing any necessary state plan amendments by January 1, 2025.</p>
<h2 id="section-20">Section 20 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-20">¶</a></h2>
