## Section 2
1. [Empty]

    a. A county legislative authority may authorize, fix, and impose a sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter.

    b. If a county with a population over eight hundred thousand has not imposed the tax authorized under this subsection by January 1, 2011, any city with a population over thirty thousand located in that county may authorize, fix, and impose the sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter. The county must provide a credit against its tax for the full amount of tax imposed under this subsection (1)(b) by any city located in that county if the county imposes the tax after January 1, 2011.

2. The tax authorized in this section is in addition to any other taxes authorized by law and must be collected from those persons who are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the county for a county's tax and within a city for a city's tax. The rate of tax equals one-tenth of one percent of the selling price in the case of a sales tax, or value of the article used, in the case of a use tax.

    d. Notwithstanding (a) through (c) of this subsection, moneys collected under this section may be used to support the cost of the judicial officer and support staff of a therapeutic court.

5. Nothing in this section may be interpreted to prohibit the use of moneys collected under this section for the replacement of lapsed federal funding previously provided for the operation or delivery of services and programs as provided in this section.

6. [Empty]

    a. Subject to the limits in (b) of this section (6), the state must provide matching funds, on an equal basis, to the funds received by counties and cities under this section.

    b. If enactment of a sales and use tax under this section at a rate of 0.1 percent at the county level would generate revenues in excess of $75,000,000, matching funds may not be provided for a county, or for cities within such a county.

7. Each year, the department must calculate the amount of tax collected by a county or city pursuant to this section that is eligible for the state match in subsection (6) of this section for the prior calendar year.
