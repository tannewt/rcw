<li>The purpose of this chapter is to</li>
</ol>
<p>establish a safety net program, including an assessment on certain nongovernmental medicaid prospective payment system hospitals and critical access hospitals and an allowance for intergovernmental transfers for designated public hospitals, which will be used solely as specified in this chapter to maintain and improve equity of access to and quality of care of hospital services for medicaid clients, including those served by managed care organizations.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the program established by this chapter will allow the state to more fully realize the benefits of increased federal financial participation in the medicaid program and to address expanded medicaid enrollment resulting from federal health care reform, thereby benefiting medicaid clients.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>That funds generated by the assessment will be matched with federal dollars whenever possible to achieve the maximum level of benefits, and that the total amount assessed under this chapter not exceed the amount needed, in combination with all other available funds, to support the payments authorized by this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions in RCW 74.60.090, the designated public hospitals will be able to receive additional federal matching funds, used only for the purposes specified in this chapter.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If the program is discontinued, any amounts remaining in the fund  shall be refunded to hospitals, pro rata according to the amount paid by the hospital since July 1, 2018, subject to the limitations of federal law.</p>
</li>

For calendar year 2024, the first assessment notice shall be sent on or before February 7th unless the conditions in RCW 74.60.150(1) are not satisfied by January 1, 2024, in which case the first assessment notice shall be sent 21 calendar days following satisfaction of those conditions. So long as none of the conditions specified in RCW 74.60.150(2) have occurred, subsequent assessment notices must be sent on or before 45 calendar days prior to the end of each quarter. Hospitals shall pay their assessments within 30 calendar days of receiving any notice.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>For calendar year 2024, unless adjusted as provided for in this chapter, the authority, after consultation with the Washington state hospital association, shall determine inpatient and outpatient assessment rates that, when applied as set forth below, will produce $510,000,000 from the inpatient assessment and $386,400,000 from the outpatient assessment. For subsequent years, the authority, in consultation with the Washington state hospital association, shall adjust the assessment amounts to fund adjustments in directed payments under RCW 74.60.130 and quality incentive payments under RCW 74.09.611.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall determine standard assessment rates for hospital inpatient and outpatient assessments that are sufficient, when applied to net nonmedicare inpatient and outpatient revenue, to produce the inpatient and outpatient assessment amounts needed to fund the payments in RCW 74.60.020(4). The standard inpatient and outpatient rates must comply with applicable federal law and regulations. If the categories of hospitals described in this section for assessment purposes do not meet federal approval requirements, they may be modified by the mutual agreement of the authority and the Washington state hospital association so that approval may be obtained.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For medicaid prospective payment system hospitals that are rehabilitation hospitals, the assessment rate to be applied to net nonmedicare inpatient revenue shall be 50 percent of the standard inpatient assessment and 50 percent of the standard outpatient assessment;</p>

<li>
<p>For medicaid prospective payment system hospitals that are cancer hospitals, the assessment rate to be applied to net nonmedicare revenue shall be 100 percent of the standard rate for inpatient revenue and 40 percent of the standard rate for outpatient revenue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For medicaid prospective payment system hospitals that are children's hospitals, the assessment rate to be applied to net nonmedicare revenue shall be five percent of the standard rate for inpatient revenue and 20 percent of the standard rate for outpatient revenue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For medicaid prospective payment system hospitals that are high government payer independent hospitals, the assessment rate to be applied to net nonmedicare revenue shall be 20 percent of the standard rate for inpatient revenue and 90 percent of the standard rate for outpatient revenue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any other medicaid prospective payment system hospitals, the assessment rate to be applied to net nonmedicare revenue is 100 percent of the standard rate for inpatient revenue and 100 percent of the standard rate for outpatient revenue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each critical access hospital, the assessment rate to be applied to net nonmedicare revenue shall be five percent of the inpatient standard rate and 40 percent of the outpatient standard assessment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If federal assessment demonstration requirements are not met for either the inpatient or outpatient assessment, the authority shall revise the other assessment in consultation with the Washington state hospital association so as to raise the same total amount of assessments. If the assessment fails federal distributional tests, the authority will work with the Washington state hospital association to develop a threshold to enable passage of the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall determine each nonexempt hospital's annual net nonmedicare revenue from the hospital's cost report data file available through the centers for medicare and medicaid services. For calendar year 2024, the authority shall use cost report data for hospitals' fiscal years ending in 2021. For subsequent years, the cost report for the next succeeding fiscal year data must be used. For any hospital without a cost report for the relevant year, including any recently opened hospital, the authority shall use the most recently available cost report or an annualized partial cost report available by June 1st reflecting at least six months of information, for annual nonmedicare net inpatient and outpatient revenue. For purposes of this subsection, annualized means the total amount divided by actual months, multiplied by 12 months.</p>

<li>
<p>If the total amount of inpatient and outpatient supplemental payments under RCW 74.60.120 is in excess of the federal limitations to aggregate maximum payment amounts and the entire excess amount cannot be disbursed by additional payments to managed care organizations under RCW 74.60.130, the authority shall proportionately reduce future assessments on medicaid prospective payment hospitals to the level necessary to generate additional payments to hospitals that are consistent with the upper payment limit plus the maximum permissible amount of additional payments to managed care organizations under RCW 74.60.130;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the amount of payments to managed care organizations under RCW 74.60.130 cannot be distributed because of failure to meet federal actuarial soundness or utilization requirements or other federal requirements, the authority shall apply the amount that cannot be distributed to reduce  assessments beginning from the time when that determination is made, to the level necessary to generate additional payments to managed care organizations that are consistent with federal actuarial soundness or utilization requirements or other federal requirements; and</p>

<p>Payment of the entire amount payable to hospitals as directed by the authority under subsection (4) of this section, less an allowance for premium taxes the organization is required to pay under Title 48 RCW;</p>

<p>Quarterly interim payments shall be made using the authority's encounter data to determine volumes of medicaid discharges and medicaid outpatient payments. The interim payments will be based on volumes of services for each hospital within each medicaid managed care organization for the equivalent period beginning nine months prior to the start of the payment period. Before providing direction to the medicaid managed care organizations the authority shall share the hospital specific data on volumes, proposed payments, and other supporting documentation with the Washington state hospital association.</p>

<li>
<p>The authority shall perform an annual reconciliation of amounts paid to each hospital based on its annual encounter data, and direct managed care organizations to make adjusted payments in the subsequent quarter or quarters based on such reconciliation. Before the annual reconciliation, the authority shall send the medicaid managed care inpatient discharges and medicaid managed care outpatient payments data to each hospital and the Washington state hospital association for verification.</p>

<p>No hospital or managed care organizations may use the payments under this section to gain advantage in negotiations.</p>
