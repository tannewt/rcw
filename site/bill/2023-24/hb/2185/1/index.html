Adverse licensing decisions including license denial, suspension, revocation, modification, or nonrenewal pursuant to RCW 43.216.325 or imposition of civil fines pursuant to RCW 43.216.335 are not subject to the internal review process in this section, but may be appealed using the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Child care facility licensing compliance agreement&quot; means an agreement issued by the department in lieu of the department taking enforcement action against a child care provider that contains: (i) A description of the violation and the rule or law that was violated; (ii) a statement from the licensee regarding the proposed plan to comply with the rule or law; (iii) the date the violation must be corrected; (iv) information regarding other licensing action that may be imposed if compliance does not occur by the required date; and (v) the signature of the licensor and licensee or the licensee's delegate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Health and safety standards&quot; means rules or requirements developed by the department to protect the health and safety of children against risk of bodily, mental, or psychological injury, harm, illness, or death.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internal review process shall be conducted by the following six individuals:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Three department employees who may include child care licensors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three child care providers selected by the department from names submitted by the oversight board for children, youth, and families established in section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internal review process established in this section may overturn, change, or uphold a department licensing decision by majority vote. In the event that the six individuals conducting the internal review process are equally divided, the secretary or the secretary's designee shall make the decision of the internal review process. The internal review process must provide the parties with a written decision of the outcome after completion of the internal review process. A licensee must request a review under the internal review process within ten days of the development of an inspection report and the internal review process must be completed within sixty days after the request from the licensee to initiate the internal review process is received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee may request a final review by the oversight board for children, youth, and families after completing the internal review process established in this section by giving notice to the department and the oversight board for children, youth, and families within ten days of receiving the written decision produced by the internal review process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall enter into performance-based contracts for the provision of family support and related services. The department may enter into performance-based contracts for additional services, other than case management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the goal of the legislature to expand the coverage area of network administrators to encompass the entire state. Recognizing that phased implementation may be necessary, the department shall conduct one or more procurement processes to expand the geographic coverage of network administrators for family support and related services. Expenditures for family support and related services purchased under this section must remain within the levels appropriated in the operating budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Network administrators shall, directly or through subcontracts with service providers:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Assist caseworkers in meeting their responsibility for implementation of case plans and individual service and safety plans;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the family support and related services within the categories of contracted services that are included in a child or family's case plan or individual service and safety plan within funds available under contract;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage the entire family support and related service array within the geographic boundaries of a given network; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the authority to redistribute funding within the network based on provider performance and the need to address service gaps if approval is provided by the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the department caseworker retains responsibility for case management, nothing in chapter 205, Laws of 2012 limits the ability of the department to continue to contract for the provision of case management services by child-placing agencies, behavioral rehabilitation services agencies, or other entities that provided case management under contract with the department prior to July 1, 2005.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procurement process must be developed and implemented in a manner that complies with applicable provisions of intergovernmental agreements between the state of Washington and tribal governments and must provide an opportunity for tribal governments to contract for service delivery through network administrators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procurement and resulting contracts must include, but are not limited to, the following standards and requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The use of family engagement approaches to successfully motivate families to engage in services and training of the network's contracted providers to apply such approaches;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of parents and youth who are successful veterans of the child welfare system to act as mentors through activities that include, but are not limited to, helping families navigate the system, facilitating parent engagement, and minimizing distrust of the child welfare system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The establishment of qualifications for service providers participating in provider networks, such as appropriate licensure or certification, education, and accreditation by professional accrediting entities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adequate provider capacity to meet the anticipated service needs in the network administrator's contracted service area. The network administrator must be able to demonstrate that its provider network is culturally competent and has adequate capacity to address disproportionality, including utilization of tribal and other ethnic providers capable of serving children and families of color or who need language-appropriate services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiscal solvency of network administrators and providers participating in the network;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of evidence-based, research-based, and promising practices, where appropriate, including fidelity and quality assurance provisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network administrator quality assurance activities, including monitoring of the performance of providers in their provider network, with respect to meeting measurable service outcomes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network administrator data reporting, including data on contracted provider performance and service outcomes; and</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Network administrator compliance with applicable provisions of intergovernmental agreements between the state of Washington and tribal governments and the federal and Washington state Indian child welfare act.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.</p>
<p>Performance-based payment methodologies must be used in network administrator contracting. Performance measures should relate to successful engagement by a child or parent in services included in their case plan, and resulting improvement in identified problem behaviors and interactions. For the initial three-year period of implementation of performance-based contracting, the department may transfer financial risk for the provision of services to network administrators only to the limited extent necessary to implement a performance-based payment methodology, such as phased payment for services. However, the department may develop a shared savings methodology through which the network administrator will receive a defined share of any savings that result from improved performance. If the department receives a Title IV-E waiver, the shared savings methodology must be consistent with the terms of the waiver. If a shared savings methodology is adopted, the network administrator shall reinvest the savings in enhanced services to better meet the needs of the families and children they serve.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>The department must actively monitor network administrator compliance with the terms of contracts executed under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of performance‑based contracts under this section must be done in a manner that does not adversely affect the state's ability to continue to obtain federal funding for child welfare-related functions currently performed by the state and with consideration of options to further maximize federal funding opportunities and increase flexibility in the use of such funds, including use for preventive and in‑home child welfare services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall, consistent with state and federal confidentiality requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Share all relevant data with the network administrators in order for the network administrators to track the performance and effectiveness of the services in the network; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make all performance data available to the public.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must not require existing network administrators to reapply to provide network administrator services in the coverage area of the existing network administrator on June 7, 2018.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2019, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department shall annually submit to the oversight board for children, youth, and families established pursuant to section 2 of this act and the appropriate committees of the legislature a report detailing the status of the network administrator procurement and implementation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the cost estimate for expanded network administrator implementation, the department shall consider the value of the existing data platform for child welfare services.</p>
