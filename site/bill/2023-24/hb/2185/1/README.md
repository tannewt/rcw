## Section 8
1. The department shall enter into performance-based contracts for the provision of family support and related services. The department may enter into performance-based contracts for additional services, other than case management.

Expenditures for family support and related services purchased under this section must remain within the levels appropriated in the operating budget.

3. [Empty]

    a. Network administrators shall, directly or through subcontracts with service providers:

        i. Assist caseworkers in meeting their responsibility for implementation of case plans and individual service and safety plans;

        iv. Have the authority to redistribute funding within the network based on provider performance and the need to address service gaps if approval is provided by the department.

For the initial three-year period of implementation of performance-based contracting, the department may transfer financial risk for the provision of services to network administrators only to the limited extent necessary to implement a performance-based payment methodology, such as phased payment for services. However, the department may develop a shared savings methodology through which the network administrator will receive a defined share of any savings that result from improved performance. If the department receives a Title IV-E waiver, the shared savings methodology must be consistent with the terms of the waiver. If a shared savings methodology is adopted, the network administrator shall reinvest the savings in enhanced services to better meet the needs of the families and children they serve.

7. The department must actively monitor network administrator compliance with the terms of contracts executed under this section.

12. In determining the cost estimate for expanded network administrator implementation, the department shall consider the value of the existing data platform for child welfare services.
