<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 7, 2012, except as provided in RCW 18.88B.041, any person hired as a long-term care worker must be certified as a home care aide as provided in this chapter within 200 calendar days after the date of hire. A long-term care worker who is not currently certified or eligible to reactivate an expired credential shall receive a new date of hire when beginning work with either a new employer or returning to a former employer after prior employment has ended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No person may practice or, by use of any title or description, represent himself or herself as a certified home care aide without being certified as provided in this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not prohibit a person: (i) From practicing a profession for which the person has been issued a license or which is specifically authorized under this state's laws; or (ii) who is exempt from certification under RCW 18.88B.041 from providing services as a long-term care worker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with consumer and worker representatives, the department shall, by January 1, 2013, establish by rule a single scope of practice that encompasses both long-term care workers who are certified home care aides and long-term care workers who are exempted from certification under RCW 18.88B.041.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency impacts the ability of long-term care workers to complete certification as required by this section, the department may adopt rules to allow long-term care workers additional time to become certified.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Rules adopted under this subsection (3) are effective until the termination of the pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency or until the department determines that additional time for long-term care workers to become certified is no longer necessary, whichever is later. Once the department determines a rule adopted under this subsection (3) is no longer necessary, it must repeal the rule under RCW 34.05.353.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 12 months of the termination of the pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency, the department shall conduct a review of certification compliance with subsection (1) of this section and rules adopted under this subsection (3) and provide the legislature with a report.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt rules to implement this section.</p>

Any long-term care worker failing to make the required grade for the examination may not be certified as a home care aide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in consultation with consumer and worker representatives, shall develop a home care aide certification examination to evaluate whether an applicant possesses the skills and knowledge necessary to practice competently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The examination or series of examinations shall include both a skills demonstration and a written or oral knowledge test. The skills demonstration, the knowledge test, or both, may be administered on the last day of a student's formal training. The examination papers, all grading of the papers, and records related to the grading of skills demonstration shall be preserved for a period of not less than one year. The department shall establish rules governing the number of times and under what circumstances individuals who have failed the examination may sit for the examination, including whether any intermediate remedial steps should be required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All examinations shall be conducted by fair and wholly impartial methods. The certification examination shall be administered and evaluated by the department , by a contractor to the department that is not an employer of long‑term care workers</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>, or by a high school or community college that has met department standards for administering the examination.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>In addition to the standards under subsection (4) of this section, the department shall examine and authorize innovative ways to reduce barriers to certification and testing, including allowing for remote proctoring of the knowledge examination, allowing long-term care workers to sign up for testing at the time of hire contingent on completion of training, and expanding the number and type of testing locations.</p>
