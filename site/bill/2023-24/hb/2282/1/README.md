# HB 2282 - African American studies

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2282.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the contributions, achievements, culture, characteristics, and issues of people of African descent is American history and that African American studies is an interdisciplinary academic field that encompasses the history, politics, culture, contributions, and achievements of people of African descent in the United States and throughout the African diaspora. The legislature acknowledges that this field of study expands the educational lens to include multicultural approaches to learning as well as new and enhanced historical narratives. The legislature recognizes that seeing themselves represented through a multidimensional and asset-based educational program has a positive impact on the identity, self-worth, academic engagement, and sense of belonging of African American students, and that students of all backgrounds and ethnicities deserve to learn about the contributions of African Americans to the United States and to the world.

2. [Empty]

    a. The legislature acknowledges that legislation enacted in 2020 directed the office of the superintendent of public instruction to convene a work group to develop recommendations for integrating African American history, examinations of racism, and the history of the civil rights movement into existing social studies curriculum provided to students in grades seven through 12. The legislation specified that the work group must review pertinent curriculum that is available to school districts, and must include recommendations for the professional development needed to support educators in providing the instruction to students.

    b. The legislature recognizes that legislation enacted in 2021 directed the office of the superintendent of public instruction to engage community members and key interested parties to develop a clear definition and framework of African American studies to guide instruction in grades seven through 12, develop a plan for aligning African American studies across all content areas, and identify related professional development opportunities.

    c. The legislature further finds that because the traditional education system has focused so heavily on a eurocentric worldview, more work needs to be done to thoughtfully and thoroughly prepare public schools and educators in Washington to offer this rich field of African American studies to its students.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to direct the office of the superintendent of public instruction to convene a work group to identify African American studies curricula in use in high schools and colleges throughout the country and to report the list of curricula to the legislature. The goal of the legislature is that public schools in Washington will select a curriculum from the list and use it to offer African American studies to students in grades seven through 12.
