<p>The Washington credential registry must be publicly available, searchable, and comparable using open specifications and linked, interoperable data formats. Such formats must be aligned with widely recognized and adopted standards and must allow for open access across state and national borders, sectors, and platforms. Such information must be human-readable, machine-actionable, current, accurate, and maintained on each provider's website and on an open national repository accessible to the public. Such requirements may be met through utilization of the credential transparency description language specifications.</p>
