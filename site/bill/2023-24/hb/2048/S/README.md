# HB 2048 - Domestic violence/sentencing

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2048-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the ongoing and increasing epidemic of domestic violence. Even when a perpetrator is held accountable by our criminal justice system, including by total confinement in a state correctional facility, many victims of domestic violence face the ongoing challenge of realizing physical and psychological safety in their daily lives. One mechanism by which the state supports survivors is through community supervision of defendants convicted of certain domestic violence offenses upon their release back into our communities.

The legislature acknowledges that the department of corrections serves a critical function by operating as the state agency entrusted with supervision of certain defendants. It is imperative that in every instance when a Washington court orders supervision for a defendant convicted of a qualifying domestic violence offense, the department of corrections undertakes its supervisory role. Accordingly, the legislature recognizes that certain changes must be made to the Washington sentencing reform act to ensure that the department of corrections' supervisory obligations are clear.

## Section 2
1. The department of corrections shall conduct an internal audit and report on its supervisory obligations under RCW 9.94A.501 (1)(b) and (4)(e). The audit and report shall, for the period identified in subsection (2) of this section: (a) Identify the number of individuals for whom a Washington court ordered supervision by the department under RCW 9.94A.501(1)(b) and (4)(e); (b) identify the number of individuals within the number identified in (a) of this subsection for whom supervision by the department was ordered but supervision did not occur or has not occurred; and (c) provide the reason or reasons why the department did not undertake supervision of an individual if the numbers identified in (a) and (b) of this subsection are not the same.

2. The audit and report required by this section must cover the period between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024.

3. The department shall report the findings of its audit to the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1, 2024.

4. This section expires December 31, 2024.
