## Section 1
Gun violence remains a persistent health and safety threat for people across our state. In Washington, a person is killed by a firearm every 14 hours and nearly half of all suicides are from firearms.

According to the 2022 national veteran suicide prevention annual report, when it comes to comparing veterans and United States adults who died from suicide in 2020, guns were more commonly involved among veterans, 71 percent, than nonveterans, 50.3 percent. Data from the Washington office of firearm safety and violence prevention show that, in 2021, 69 percent of all firearm-related deaths were suicides. Further, deaths by gun violence is the leading cause in Washington for teens between ages 15 and 19.

This act intends to impose a sales and use tax on ammunition statewide. The revenue from this will go to programs that aim to prevent suicide and to reduce firearm-related domestic violence.
