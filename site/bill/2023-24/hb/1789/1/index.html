<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that there are myriad ways for the department of natural resources to generate revenue from state lands for the benefit of its beneficiaries and the state. The legislature recognizes it is in the best interest of the trust beneficiaries and the state to increase revenue opportunities, diversify the trust asset portfolio, and reduce costs. As new markets emerge, the department should be enabled to take full advantage of opportunities to diversify and grow revenue streams for beneficiaries and the state, while also reducing costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the trust land performance assessment, completed pursuant to section 7015, chapter 298, Laws of 2018, recommends exploring opportunities to diversify funding streams for revenue generation, including utilizing carbon markets, as well as other ways to monetize ecosystem services for the beneficiaries and the state. The legislature further finds that the climate commitment act, which established a cap and invest program under chapter 70A.65 RCW, makes Washington state a leader in climate policy and, through the codification of carbon offset projects, creates a new way for revenue to be generated from lands and waters in the state. The legislature intends that the carbon offset projects established for this program benefit the people of Washington by being located on Washington lands and waters to the extent possible, rather than outside the state. To accomplish this, the department seeks the authority to sell carbon offset credits directly under the rules of the Washington state cap and invest program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that as the manager of approximately 6,000,000 acres of lands and waters, the department is well suited to take actions that increase carbon sequestration and storage, generate revenue from those actions through carbon offset projects, and provide additional benefits including reforestation, forest health restoration, afforestation, air and water purification, habitat creation, temperature regulation, stormwater management, and disaster mitigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that private industry is leading the way by entering carbon markets and that the department should have similar authority as private industry to enter carbon markets to generate revenue and reduce costs for beneficiaries and the state. For these reasons, the legislature believes the department should have the same authority to enter carbon markets as private industry for carbon offset and ecosystem services projects on state lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, the legislature finds that by granting the department direct authority to enter carbon markets, the department will be able to create additional revenue streams to complement existing traditional revenue streams thereby reducing costs for beneficiaries and the state. Opportunities include projects in which the department would be able to generate revenue through the reforestation of certain postwildfire areas that otherwise would not have been replanted. These areas will regenerate more quickly and robustly than had they not been replanted, which will result in more revenue for beneficiaries from future harvests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that forest health treatments that increase the resilience of Washington forests to wildfire may be eligible for carbon offset projects, thus creating a new source of funding for those treatments, reducing the costs to the state or beneficiaries by generating new revenue sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that areas that have been transferred out of trust status into natural areas or natural resource conservation areas may be eligible for carbon offset projects or other payment for ecosystem services projects, which would create a new revenue stream from lands that otherwise would not generate revenue and that the department currently incurs a cost to maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature additionally finds that the department could acquire working forestlands at risk of conversion, and generate revenue for beneficiaries and for the state both through carbon offset projects having prevented the forestland from likely converting to nonforestland, and additionally through future harvests on those acquired forestlands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that similar opportunities exist in aquatic lands for kelp and eelgrass conservation and restoration projects that reduce conservation and restoration costs to the state and help to generate revenue for aquatic lands enhancement account funds for salmon habitat improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish the direct authority for the department to generate revenue on its lands and waters through payment for ecosystem services programs including, but not limited to, carbon offset projects. Accordingly, the legislature intends to provide the department the necessary authority to create carbon offset and ecosystem services projects under the cap and invest program.</p>
