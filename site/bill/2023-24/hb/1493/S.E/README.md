## Section 5
1.  The department shall require that a person may drive only a motor vehicle equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device:

    a.  Upon receipt of notice from a court that an ignition interlock device restriction has been imposed under RCW 10.21.055;

    d.  After any applicable period of mandatory suspension, revocation, or denial of driving privileges, or upon fulfillment of day-for-day credit under RCW 46.61.5055(9)(b)(ii) for a suspension, revocation, or denial of driving privileges:

    e.  Upon receipt of an order by a court having jurisdiction that a person charged or convicted of any offense involving the use, consumption, or possession of alcohol while operating a motor vehicle may drive only a motor vehicle equipped with a functioning ignition interlock. The court shall establish a specific alcohol set point at which the ignition interlock will prevent the vehicle from being started. The court shall also establish the period of time for which ignition interlock use will be required.

2.  Unless otherwise specified by the court for a restriction imposed under subsection (1)(e) of this section, the ignition interlock device shall have an alcohol set point that prevents the motor vehicle from being started when the breath sample provided has an alcohol concentration of 0.020 or more.

3.  A restriction imposed under:

    a. Subsection (1)(a) of this section shall remain in effect until:

        i. The court has authorized the removal of the device under RCW 10.21.055; or

        ii. The department has imposed a restriction under subsection (1)(b), (c), or (d) of this section arising out of the same incident.

    b. Subsection (1)(b) of this section remains in effect during the validity of any ignition interlock driver's license that has been issued to the person.

    c. Subsection (1)(c)(i) or (d)(i) of this section shall be for no less than:

        i. For a person who has not previously been restricted under this subsection, a period of one year;

        ii. For a person who has previously been restricted under (c)(i) of this subsection, a period of five years;

        iii. For a person who has previously been restricted under (c)(ii) of this subsection, a period of 10 years.

For purposes of determining a period of restriction for a person restricted pursuant to a conviction under (d) of this subsection, a restriction based on a deferred prosecution under subsection (1)(c) of this section arising out of the same incident is not considered a prior restriction for purposes of this subsection.

    d. Subsection (1)(c)(ii) or (d)(ii) of this section shall be for a period of no less than six months.

    e. The period of restriction under (c) or (d) of this subsection shall be extended by 180 days whenever the department receives notice that the restricted person has been convicted under RCW 46.20.740 or 46.20.750. If the period of restriction under (c) or (d) of this subsection has been fulfilled and cannot be extended, the department must add a new 180-day restriction that is imposed from the date of conviction and is subject to the requirements for removal under subsection (4) of this section.

For all drivers restricted under this section with incidents and restriction start dates prior to June 9, 2016, a driver may apply to waive the restriction by applying for a determination from the department that the person is unable to operate an ignition interlock device due to a physical disability. The department's determination that a person is unable to operate an ignition interlock device must be reasonable and be based upon good and substantial evidence. This determination is subject to review by a court of competent jurisdiction. The department may charge a person seeking a medical exemption under this subsection a reasonable fee for the assessment.

4.  A restriction imposed under subsection (1)(c) or (d) of this section shall remain in effect until the department receives a declaration from the person's ignition interlock device vendor, in a form provided or approved by the department, certifying the following:

    a. That there have been none of the following incidents in the 180 consecutive days prior to the date of release:

        i. Any attempt to start the vehicle with a breath alcohol concentration of 0.04 or more unless a subsequent test performed within 10 minutes registers a breath alcohol concentration lower than 0.04 and the digital image confirms the same person provided both samples;

        ii. Failure to take any random test unless a review of the digital image confirms that the vehicle was not occupied by the driver at the time of the missed test;

        iii. Failure to pass any random retest with a breath alcohol concentration of lower than 0.020 unless a subsequent test performed within 10 minutes registers a breath alcohol concentration lower than 0.020, and the digital image confirms the same person provided both samples;

        iv. Failure of the person to appear at the ignition interlock device vendor when required for maintenance, repair, calibration, monitoring, inspection, or replacement of the device; or

    v. Removal of the ignition interlock device by a person other than an ignition interlock technician certified by the Washington state patrol; and

    b. That the ignition interlock device was inspected at the conclusion of the 180-day period by an ignition interlock technician certified by the Washington state patrol and no evidence was found that the device was tampered with in the manner described in RCW 46.20.750.

5.  (a) The time period during which a person has an ignition interlock device installed in order to meet the requirements of subsection (1)(b) of this section shall apply on a day-for-day basis toward satisfying the period of time the ignition interlock device restriction is imposed under subsection (1)(c) or (d) of this section arising out of the same incident.

    b. The department must also give the person a day-for-day credit for any time period, beginning from the date of the incident, during which the person kept an ignition interlock device installed on all vehicles the person operates, other than those subject to the employer exemption under subsection (6) of this section.

    c. If the day-for-day credit granted under this subsection equals or exceeds the period of time the ignition interlock device restriction is imposed under subsection (1)(c) or (d) of this section arising out of the same incident, and the person has already met the requirements for removal of the device under subsection (4) of this section, the department may waive the requirement that a device be installed or that the person again meet the requirements for removal.

6.  (a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the installation of an ignition interlock device is not necessary on vehicles owned, leased, or rented by a person's employer and on those vehicles whose care and/or maintenance is the temporary responsibility of the employer, and driven at the direction of a person's employer as a requirement of employment during working hours. The person must provide the department with a declaration pursuant to chapter 5.50 RCW from his or her employer stating that the person's employment requires the person to operate a vehicle owned by the employer or other persons during working hours. When the department receives a declaration under this subsection, it shall attach or imprint a notation on the person's driving record stating that the employer exemption applies.

    b. The employer exemption does not apply when the employer's vehicle is assigned exclusively to the restricted driver and used solely for commuting to and from employment.

    c. The employer exemption does not apply to a person who is self-employed unless the person's vehicle is used exclusively for the person's employment.

7.  In addition to any other costs associated with the use of an ignition interlock device imposed on the person restricted under this section, the person shall pay an additional fee of $21 per month. Payments must be made directly to the ignition interlock company. The company shall remit the additional fee to the department to be deposited into the ignition interlock device revolving account, except that the company may retain 25 cents per month of the additional fee to cover the expenses associated with administering the fee. The department may waive the monthly fee if the person is indigent under RCW 10.101.010.

8.  For a person restricted under this section who is residing outside of the state of Washington, the department may accept verification of installation of an ignition interlock device by an ignition interlock company authorized to do business in the jurisdiction in which the person resides, provided the device meets any applicable requirements of that jurisdiction. The department may waive one or more requirements for removal under subsection (4) of this section if compliance with the requirement or requirements would be impractical in the case of a person residing in another jurisdiction, provided the person is in compliance with any equivalent requirement of that jurisdiction. The department may waive the monthly fee required by subsection (7) of this section if collection of the fee would be impractical in the case of a person residing in another jurisdiction.

## Section 6
1.

The department shall determine the person's eligibility for licensing based upon written verification by a company doing business in the state that it has installed the required device on a vehicle owned or operated by the person seeking reinstatement. If, based upon notification from the interlock provider or otherwise, the department determines that an ignition interlock required under this section is no longer installed or functioning as required, the department shall suspend the person's license or privilege to drive. Whenever the license or driving privilege of any person is suspended or revoked as a result of noncompliance with an ignition interlock requirement, the suspension shall remain in effect until the person provides notice issued by a company doing business in the state that a vehicle owned or operated by the person is equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device.

2. It is a gross misdemeanor for a person with such a notation on his or her driving record to operate a motor vehicle that is not so equipped, unless the notation resulted from a restriction imposed as a condition of release and the restriction has been released by the court prior to driving. Any time a person is convicted under this section, the court shall immediately notify the department for purposes of RCW 46.20.720(3)(e). It is an affirmative defense, which the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer exemption in RCW 46.20.720(6) applies. The court shall not admit evidence of this defense unless the defendant notifies the prosecution prior to the omnibus or pretrial hearing in the case of the defendant's intent to assert the affirmative defense.

3. Any sentence imposed for a violation of subsection (2) of this section shall be served consecutively with any sentence imposed under RCW 46.20.750, 46.61.502, 46.61.504, or 46.61.5055.

## Section 7
1.  Except as provided in RCW 46.61.502(6) or 46.61.504(6), a person who is convicted of a violation of RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 and who has no prior offense within seven years shall be punished as follows:

    a.  In the case of a person whose alcohol concentration was less than 0.15, or for whom for reasons other than the person's refusal to take a test offered pursuant to RCW 46.20.308 there is no test result indicating the person's alcohol concentration:

        i. By imprisonment for not less than 24 consecutive hours nor more than 364 days. In lieu of the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment required under this subsection (1)(a)(i), the court, in its discretion, may order not less than 15 days of electronic home monitoring or a 90-day period of 24/7 sobriety program monitoring. The court may consider the offender's pretrial 24/7 sobriety program monitoring as fulfilling a portion of posttrial sentencing. The offender shall pay the cost of electronic home monitoring. The county or municipality in which the penalty is being imposed shall determine the cost. The court may also require the offender's electronic home monitoring device or other separate alcohol monitoring device to include an alcohol detection breathalyzer, and the court may restrict the amount of alcohol the offender may consume during the time the offender is on electronic home monitoring; and

        ii. By a fine of not less than $350 nor more than $5,000. $350 of the fine may not be suspended unless the court finds the offender to be indigent; or

    b.  In the case of a person whose alcohol concentration was at least 0.15, or for whom by reason of the person's refusal to take a test offered pursuant to RCW 46.20.308 there is no test result indicating the person's alcohol concentration:

12.  A court may waive the electronic home monitoring requirements of this chapter when:

    a. The offender does not have a dwelling, telephone service, or any other necessity to operate an electronic home monitoring system.
