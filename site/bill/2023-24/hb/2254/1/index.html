<li>
<p>Neither parent's child support obligation owed for all his or her biological or legal children may exceed 45 percent of net income except for good cause shown.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each child is entitled to a pro rata share of the income available for support, but the court only applies the pro rata share to the children in the case before the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before determining whether to apply the 45 percent limitation, the court must consider whether it would be unjust to apply the limitation after considering the best interests of the child and the circumstances of each parent. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, leaving insufficient funds in the custodial parent's household to meet the basic needs of the child, comparative hardship to the affected households, assets or liabilities, and any involuntary limits on either parent's earning capacity including incarceration, disabilities, or incapacity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good cause includes, but is not limited to, possession of substantial wealth, children with day care expenses, special medical need, educational need, psychological need, and larger families.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) When a parent's monthly net income is below 125 percent of the federal poverty guideline for a one-person family, a support order of not less than $50 per child per month shall be entered unless the obligor parent establishes that it would be unjust to do so in that particular case. The decision whether there is a sufficient basis to deviate below the presumptive minimum payment must take into consideration the best interests of the child and the circumstances of each parent. Such circumstances can include leaving insufficient funds in the custodial parent's household to meet the basic needs of the child, comparative hardship to the affected households, assets or liabilities, and earning capacity.</p>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>
<p>The basic support obligation of the parent making the transfer payment, excluding health care, day care, and special child-rearing expenses, shall not reduce his or her net income below the self-support reserve of 180 percent of the federal poverty level for a one-person family, except for the presumptive minimum payment of $50 per child per month or when it would be unjust to apply the self-support reserve limitation after considering the best interests of the child and the circumstances of each parent. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, leaving insufficient funds in the custodial parent's household to meet the basic needs of the child, comparative hardship to the affected households, assets or liabilities, and earning capacity. This section shall not be construed to require monthly substantiation of income.</p>

<p>When a parent's income is greater than the self-support reserve of 180 percent of the federal poverty level for a one-person household, neither parent's basic child support obligation owed for all of his or her biological or legal children may reduce that parent's income below the self-support reserve of 180 percent of the federal poverty guideline for a one-person household except for the presumptive minimum of $50 per child per month.</p>

<p>Each child is entitled to a pro rata share of the income available for support but the court only applies the pro rata share to the children in the case before the court.

<p>The economic table is presumptive for combined monthly net incomes up to and including $50,000. When combined monthly net income exceeds $50,000, the court may exceed the presumptive amount of support set for combined monthly net incomes of $50,000 upon written findings of fact.</p>

<p>All income and resources of each parent's household shall be disclosed and considered by the court when the court determines the child support obligation of each parent. Only the income of the parents of the children whose support is at issue shall be calculated for purposes of calculating the basic support obligation. Income and resources of any other person shall not be included in calculating the basic support obligation.</p>

<p>The court shall impute income to a parent when the parent is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed. The court shall determine whether the parent is voluntarily underemployed or voluntarily unemployed based upon that parent's assets, residence, employment and earnings history, job skills, educational attainment, literacy, health, age, criminal record, dependency court obligations, and other employment barriers, record of seeking work, the local job market, the availability of employers willing to hire the parent, the prevailing earnings level in the local community, or any other relevant factors. A court shall not impute income to a parent who is gainfully employed on a full-time basis, unless the court finds that the parent is voluntarily underemployed and finds that the parent is purposely underemployed to reduce the parent's child support obligation. Income shall not be imputed for an unemployable parent. Income shall not be imputed to a parent to the extent the parent is unemployed or significantly underemployed due to the parent's efforts to comply with court-ordered reunification efforts under chapter 13.34 RCW or under a voluntary placement agreement with an agency supervising the child.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, in the absence of records of a parent's actual earnings, the court shall impute a parent's income in the following order of priority:</p>

<p>Full-time earnings at the current rate of pay;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-time earnings at the historical rate of pay based on reliable information, such as employment security department data;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-time earnings at a past rate of pay where information is incomplete or sporadic;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earnings of 32 hours per week at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where the parent resides if the parent is on or recently coming off temporary assistance for needy families or recently coming off aged, blind, or disabled assistance benefits, pregnant women assistance benefits, essential needs and housing support, supplemental security income, or disability, has recently been released from incarceration, or is a recent high school graduate. Imputation of earnings at 32 hours per week under this subsection is a rebuttable presumption;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-time earnings at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where the parent resides if the parent has a recent history of minimum wage earnings, has never been employed and has no earnings history, or has no significant earnings history;</p>

If a parent who is currently enrolled in high school is determined to be voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed, the court shall impute income at earnings of 20 hours per week at minimum wage in the jurisdiction where that parent resides. Imputation of earnings at 20 hours per week under this subsection is a rebuttable presumption.</li>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The basic child support obligation derived from the economic table shall be allocated between the parents based on each parent's share of the combined monthly net income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care costs are not included in the economic table. Monthly health care costs shall be shared by the parents in the same proportion as the basic child support obligation. Health care costs shall include, but not be limited to, medical, dental, orthodontia, vision, chiropractic, mental health treatment, prescription medications, and other similar costs for care and treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day care and special child rearing expenses, such as tuition and long-distance transportation costs to and from the parents for visitation purposes, are not included in the economic table. These expenses shall be shared by the parents in the same proportion as the basic child support obligation. If an obligor pays court or administratively ordered day care or special child rearing expenses that are not actually incurred, the obligee must reimburse the obligor for the overpayment if the overpayment amounts to at least 20 percent of the obligor's annual day care or special child rearing expenses. The obligor may institute an action in the superior court or file an application for an adjudicative hearing with the department of social and health services for reimbursement of day care and special child rearing expense overpayments that amount to 20 percent or more of the obligor's annual day care and special child rearing expenses. Any ordered overpayment reimbursement shall be applied first as an offset to child support arrearages of the obligor. If the obligor does not have child support arrearages, the reimbursement may be in the form of a direct reimbursement by the obligee or a credit against the obligor's future support payments. If the reimbursement is in the form of a credit against the obligor's future child support payments, the credit shall be spread equally over a 12-month period. Absent agreement of the obligee, nothing in this section entitles an obligor to pay more than his or her proportionate share of day care or other special child rearing expenses in advance and then deduct the overpayment from future support transfer payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory educational expenses and optional educational expenses are not included in the economic table. These expenses must be shared by the parents in the same proportion as the basic child support obligation. Mandatory educational expenses include, but are not limited to, tuition, books and materials, required electronic devices, and required school payments or fees. Optional educational expenses are expenses that a student incurs to fully participate in school activities including, but not limited to, sports fees, sports uniforms, band fees, band uniforms, yearbooks, driving classes, and other expenses for participation in school programs or activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may exercise its discretion to determine the necessity for and the reasonableness of all amounts ordered in excess of the basic child support obligation.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Either the department, the person required to pay support, the payee under the order, or the person entitled to receive support may make a request for abatement of child support based on incapacitation of the person required to pay support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a child support order contains language providing for abatement based on incapacitation of the person required to pay child support, there is a rebuttable presumption that an incapacitated person is unable to pay the child support obligation. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence demonstrating that the person required to pay support has possession of, or access to, income or assets available to provide support while incapacitated. Unless the presumption is rebutted, the provisions of subsection (4) of this section apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the child support order does not contain language providing for abatement based on incapacitation of the person required to pay support, the department, the person required to pay support, the payee under the order, or the person entitled to receive support may commence an action in the appropriate forum to:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Modify the support order to contain abatement language; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abate the person's child support obligation due to current incapacitation for a maximum of six months.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a proceeding brought under this subsection, there is a rebuttable presumption that an incapacitated person is unable to pay the child support obligation. The department, the payee under the order, or the person entitled to receive support, may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the person required to pay support has possession of, or access to, income or assets available to provide support while incapacitated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the presumption is rebutted, the provisions of subsection (4) of this section apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court or administrative forum determines that abatement of support is appropriate, the court or administrative forum must enter an order providing that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The child support obligation under the order in front of the court is abated to $50 per month, without regard to the number of children covered by that order, while the person required to pay support is undergoing court-ordered behavioral health treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abatement of the support obligation to $50 per month will remain in place until the earlier of: The last day of the month in which the person is discharged from court-ordered behavioral health treatment; or the last day of the six months after the effective date of the abatement order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After abatement of support is terminated, the support obligation of the person required to pay support under the order is automatically reinstated at 100 percent of the support amount provided in the underlying order.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Upon a showing of good cause by a party that the circumstances of the case allow it, the court or administrative forum may add specific provisions to the order abating the child support obligation regarding when and how the abatement may terminate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the period of abatement, the department, the person required to pay support, the payee under the order, or the person entitled to receive support may commence an action to modify the child support order under RCW 26.09.170 or 74.20A.059.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the incapacitated person's support obligation under the order has been abated and then reinstated under subsection (4) of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Either the department, the person required to pay support, the payee under the order, or the person entitled to receive support may file an action to modify or adjust the order in the appropriate forum, if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The provisions of subsection (4)(c) of this section do not apply; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person required to pay support has completed court-ordered behavioral health treatment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An action to modify or adjust the order based on the completion of court-ordered behavioral health treatment of the person required to pay support may be filed even if there is no other change of circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effective date of abatement of a child support obligation based on incapacitation to $50 per month per order is the date on which the person required to pay support is approved for abatement by the court or administrative forum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abatement of a child support obligation based on incapacitation of the person required to pay support does not constitute modification or adjustment of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abatement of a child support obligation based on incapacitation of the person required to pay support shall only be approved one time in a person's lifetime, regardless of whether the abatement lasted the full six months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A request for the abatement of child support owed under one child support order does not automatically qualify as a request for abatement of support owed under every order that may exist requiring that person to pay support. However, the request applies to any support order which is being enforced by the department at the time of the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are multiple orders requiring the incapacitated person to pay child support, the issue of whether abatement of support due to incapacitation is appropriate must be considered for each order.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The payee or person entitled to receive support under each support order is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the potential abatement of support under that order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the child or children covered by a support order are not residing with the payee under the order, any other person entitled to receive support for the child or children must be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the potential abatement of support under that order.</p>

<li>
<p>Review the support order for abatement once the department receives notice from the person required to pay support or someone acting on his or her behalf that the person may qualify for abatement of support;</p>

<pre><code>b. The superior court may order immediate or delayed income withholding as follows:

    i. Immediate income withholding may be ordered if the person required to pay support has earnings. If immediate income withholding is ordered under this subsection, all support payments shall be paid to the Washington state support registry. The superior court shall issue a mandatory wage assignment order as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW when the support order is signed by the court. The payee under the order or the person entitled to receive the transfer payment is responsible for serving the employer with the order and for its enforcement as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW.

    ii. If immediate income withholding is not ordered, the court shall require that income withholding be delayed until a payment is past due. The support order shall contain a statement that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits, and liens enforced against real and personal property under the child support statutes of this or any other state, without further notice to the person required to pay support, after a payment is past due.

c.

<p>If the person required to pay support or the person entitled to receive support files the application more than one year after the date of service, the office of administrative hearings shall schedule an adjudicative proceeding at which the party who requested the late hearing must show good cause for failure to file a timely application. The filing of the application does not stay future collection action and does not affect prior collection action:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the presiding officer finds that good cause exists, the presiding officer shall proceed to hear the party's objection to the notice and determine the support obligation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the presiding officer finds that good cause does not exist, the presiding officer shall treat the application as a petition for prospective modification of the amount for current and future support established under the notice and finding. In the modification proceeding, the presiding officer shall set current and future support under chapter 26.19 RCW. The petitioning party need show neither good cause nor a substantial change of circumstances to justify modification of current and future support;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the support obligation was based upon imputed median net income, the grant standard, or the family need standard, the division of child support may file an application for adjudicative proceeding more than 20 days after the date of service of the notice. The office of administrative hearings shall schedule an adjudicative proceeding and provide notice of the hearing to the person required to pay support and the person entitled to receive support. The presiding officer shall determine the support obligation for the entire period covered by the notice, based upon credible evidence presented by the division of child support, the person required to pay support, or the person entitled to receive support, or may determine that the support obligation set forth in the notice is correct. The division of child support demonstrates good cause by showing that the support obligation was based upon imputed median net income, the grant standard, or the family need standard. The filing of the application by the division of child support does not stay further collection action, pending the entry of a final administrative order, and does not affect any prior collection action;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall retain and/or shall not refund support money collected more than 20 days after the date of service of the notice. Money withheld as the result of collection action shall be delivered to the department. The department shall distribute such money, as provided in published rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an application for an adjudicative proceeding is filed, the presiding or reviewing officer shall determine the past liability and responsibility, if any, of the person required to pay support and shall also determine the amount of periodic payments to be made in the future, which amount is not limited by the amount of any public assistance payment made to or for the benefit of the child. If deviating from the child support schedule in making these determinations, the presiding or reviewing officer shall apply the standards contained in the child support schedule and enter written findings of fact supporting the deviation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If either the person required to pay support or the person entitled to receive support fails to attend or participate in the hearing or other stage of an adjudicative proceeding, upon a showing of valid service, the presiding officer shall enter an order of default against each party who did not appear and may enter an administrative order declaring the support debt and payment provisions stated in the notice and finding of financial responsibility to be assessed and determined and subject to collection action. The parties who appear may enter an agreed settlement or consent order, which may be different than the terms of the department's notice. Any party who appears may choose to proceed to the hearing, after the conclusion of which the presiding officer or reviewing officer may enter an order that is different than the terms stated in the notice, if the obligation is supported by credible evidence presented by any party at the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final administrative order establishing liability and/or future periodic support payments shall be superseded upon entry of a superior court order for support to the extent the superior court order is inconsistent with the administrative order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debts determined pursuant to this section, accrued and not paid, are subject to collection action under this chapter without further necessity of action by a presiding or reviewing officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department has rule-making authority to enact rules consistent with 42 U.S.C. Sec. 652(f) and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 666(a)(19) as amended by section 7307 of the deficit reduction act of 2005. Additionally, the department has rule-making authority to implement regulations required under 45 C.F.R. Parts 302, 303, 304, 305, and 308.</p>

<p>The department, the person entitled to receive support, the payee under the order, or : (a) The person required to pay support may petition for a prospective modification of a final administrative order if the person required to pay support is currently confined in a jail, prison, or correctional facility for at least six months or is serving a sentence greater than six months in a jail, prison, or correctional facility, and the support order does not contain language regarding abatement due to incarceration; or (b) the person required to pay support is currently undergoing court-ordered behavioral health treatment and the support order does not contain language regarding abatement due to incapacitation.</p>
<pre><code> i. The petition may be filed at any time after the administrative support order became a final order, as long as the person required to pay support is currently incarcerated or undergoing court-ordered behavioral health treatment.

 ii. As part of the petition for modification, the petitioner may also request that the support obligation be abated to $10 per month per order due to incarceration, as provided in RCW 26.09.320, or abated to $50 per month per order due to incapacitation, as provided in section 5 of this act.

<p>An order of child support may be modified at any time without a showing of substantially changed circumstances if incarceration of the person required to pay support is the basis for the inconsistency between the existing child support order amount and the amount of support determined as a result of a review.</p>

<p>An order of child support may be modified one year or more after it has been entered without showing a substantial change of circumstances:</p>
