<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An endorsement holder shall give due consideration to the location where the licensee will conduct off-site and pop-up retail sales, service, and consumption, with respect to the proximity of churches and public institutions, as those terms are used and defined in RCW 66.24.010, and schools as used in RCW 66.24.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving notice as provided in subsection (3)(a) of this section of an endorsement holder's plans to operate off-site or pop-up service, sales, and consumption, the board must provide written notice, with receipt verification, of the endorsement holder's notice, to public institutions, as defined in RCW 66.24.010, that are identified by the board as appropriate to receive such notice, to churches, and to schools, any of which entities are within 500 feet of the location. If the board receives written objections within 14 days after receiving such notice, from an official representative or representatives of the entity, indicating to the board that there is an objection to the location or the operation by the endorsement holder, then the board shall proceed as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the objection is from a tax-supported public elementary of secondary school or any private school under Title 28A RCW, the board shall notify the endorsement holder and the endorsement holder shall immediately cease operating at that location; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the objection is from a church or public institution, as defined in RCW 66.24.010, and the licensee continues to operate over the objections, then at the time of renewal of the endorsement the board may, in its discretion, deny an endorsement holder's renewal of the endorsement after first providing the endorsement holder an opportunity for a hearing where board representatives must present and defend the board's initial decision to deny renewal of an endorsement under this section, and representatives of the church or public institution present their objections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving notice as provided in subsection (3)(a) of this section of an endorsement holder's plans to operate off-site or pop-up service, sales, and consumption, the board must send written notification to the chief executive officer of the incorporated city or town in which the location is situated, or to the county legislative authority if the location is outside the boundaries of incorporated cities or towns. The incorporated city or town or county legislative authority may submit written objections within 14 days after the date of transmittal of the notice, against the endorsement holder or against the location for which the operations will occur or are occurring. If an endorsement holder continues operating at a location for which written objections have been filed under this subsection, the board may in its discretion deny an endorsement holder's renewal of the endorsement under this section after first providing the endorsement holder an opportunity for a hearing where board representatives must present and defend the board's initial decision to deny renewal of an endorsement under this section and a representative of the city, town, or county, presents their objections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;off-site and pop-up retail sales, service, and consumption&quot; means the retail sale, service, and consumption of beer or wine at a location off of the licensed production facility for which the domestic brewery, microbrewery, or domestic winery has permission or legal authority to possess and use for the sale, service, and consumption of beer or wine.</p>
