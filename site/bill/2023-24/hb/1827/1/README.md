## Section 2
1. An immunization registry created within the department is available to all licensed health care providers in Washington to support the department's immunization activities. The registry must serve as the primary vaccine management tool for providers enrolled in the childhood vaccine program and its successors, assist schools in assessing immunization compliance, and provide official immunization certificates. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the department must include all children born in this state in the immunization registry by using the birth records from the state office of vital statistics. The department must add other children to the registry as immunization services are provided.

2. The department may not require enrollment in the immunization registry or otherwise require persons to submit to any form of immunization tracking.

3. Any person may refuse to be included in the immunization registry. A person may refuse to be included in the immunization registry by signing a form obtained from the department of health, or from the health care provider or entity that provides the immunization. A parent or guardian of a child may refuse on behalf of the child. The form must indicate that the person does not wish to be included in the immunization registry. Each consent to treatment form provided by a health care provider or by an entity that administers vaccinations or causes vaccinations to be administered must contain a notice stating that the person may refuse to be included in the immunization registry. A person may either submit the opt-out form directly to the department or provide it to the health care provider upon administration of the vaccination. If submitted to the health care provider, the health care provider must submit the form to the department. If a person has refused to be included in an immunization registry, any records or identifying information pertaining to the person must be removed from the registry.

4. The immunization registry must allow for immunization records to be electronically available to entities that are required by law to have such records, including, but not limited to, schools and licensed day care centers. However, the department may not include a person's immunization records in any interstate or federal immunization tracking system or otherwise allow an entity not required by law to have such records without first obtaining written informed consent from the person or the person's parent or guardian, if the person is a minor, to release the immunization records for such purpose.

5. A health care provider licensed under Title 18 RCW who administers vaccinations or causes vaccinations to be administered is required to report vaccination data to the immunization registry unless a person has refused to be included in the immunization registry by meeting the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. The upload of data from existing automated systems is an acceptable method for updating immunization information in the immunization registry. The information in the immunization registry may include the person's name, date of birth, address, and any other unique identifier necessary to correctly identify the person; the immunization record, including the date, type of administered vaccine, and vaccine lot number; and the presence or absence of any adverse reaction or contraindication related to the immunization. Information received by the department for the immunization registry retains its status as confidential medical information, and the department must maintain the confidentiality of that information as otherwise required by law. A health care provider or entity that obtains information from the immunization registry must maintain the confidentiality of any medical records in accordance with federal and state law.

## Section 4
This chapter shall be known as the "law against discrimination." It is an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the public welfare, health, and peace of the people of this state, and in fulfillment of the provisions of the Constitution of this state concerning civil rights. The legislature hereby finds and declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants because of race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, vaccination or immunity status, families with children, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability are a matter of state concern, that such discrimination threatens not only the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state. A state agency is herein created with powers with respect to elimination and prevention of discrimination in employment, in credit and insurance transactions, in places of public resort, accommodation, or amusement, and in real property transactions because of race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, vaccination or immunity status, families with children, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability; and the commission established hereunder is hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.

The provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to repeal any of the provisions of any other law of this state relating to discrimination because of race, color, creed, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, vaccination or immunity status, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability, other than a law which purports to require or permit doing any act which is an unfair practice under this chapter. However, to the extent that distinction or differential treatment on the basis of citizenship or immigration status or vaccine or immunity status is authorized by federal or state law, regulation, or government contract, it is not an unfair practice. Nor shall anything herein contained be construed to deny the right to any person to institute any action or pursue any civil or criminal remedy based upon an alleged violation of his or her civil rights. This chapter shall not be construed to endorse any specific belief, practice, behavior, or orientation. Inclusion of sexual orientation in this chapter shall not be construed to modify or supersede state law relating to marriage.

## Section 6
