<p>Adopt policies, and adopt, issue, and enforce rules pertaining to the use, care, and administration of state parks and parkways. The commission shall cause a copy of the rules to be kept posted in a conspicuous place in every state park to which they are applicable, but failure to post or keep any rule posted shall be no defense to any prosecution for the violation thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permit the use of state parks and parkways by the public under such rules as shall be adopted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear, drain, grade, seed, and otherwise improve or beautify parks and parkways, and erect structures, buildings, fireplaces, and comfort stations and build and maintain paths, trails, and roadways through or on parks and parkways.

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Leases exceeding a 20-year term, or the amendment or modification of these leases, shall require a vote consistent with RCW 79A.05.025(2).</p>
</li>
<li>
