<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Washington state has been a leader in recycling policy, reaching the goal of 50 percent recycling set by the legislature in RCW 70A.205.005. The legislature further finds that, since meeting the state's goal to achieve a 50 percent recycling rate, global market conditions have caused the recycling rate to fall below 50 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New goals and target recycling rates must be established and a comprehensive needs assessment is necessary to implement improvements to Washington's existing recycling system to reach those goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>88 percent of Washington residents living in single-family homes and 77 percent living in multifamily residences have access to curbside recycling services through a robust regulatory structure that ensures equal access to services at affordable rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The investments in infrastructure by Washington companies has led to the development of materials sorting and processing superior to most other states.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Producers increase the use of postconsumer recycled content in their products, to achieve the goals in RCW 70A.520.010(2) and to create strong markets for recycled materials and achieve environmental benefits; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through design and innovation, producers will reduce the use and climate impact of consumer packaging and paper products and increase the use of postconsumer recycled content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that contamination in the recycling stream is a major impediment to higher recovery rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to implement proven strategies to address these challenges, including:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The establishment of a single statewide list of materials for recyclables collected through Washington's curbside recycling system to reduce confusion and increase participation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A robust needs assessment unique to Washington state to determine costs and investments necessary to achieve a 60 percent overall recycling rate for packaging;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restrictions on the use of recycling symbols on packaging that cannot be readily recycled through Washington's recycling system; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expansion of the successful recycled content requirements to ensure more materials are manufactured with postconsumer material.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, it is the intent of the legislature that Washington should maintain the successful public-private partnership between state, local government, and solid waste and recycling service providers. The legislature does not intend to diminish or displace the primary role of the utilities and transportation commission and local governments in regulating or contracting directly with service providers for the curbside collection of residential recyclables. Local governments maintain their existing authority to collect, contract for collection with solid waste and recycling service providers, or defer to solid waste collection services regulated by the utilities and transportation commission.</p>

b. Compile information related to actual costs for curbside collection services, drop-off collection services, and other information relevant to the funding requirements to achieve performance rates, including costs for various service methods recommended by stakeholders during the study scoping process;

c. Estimate the total costs of investments necessary to reach target rates, within each jurisdiction, as well as ongoing program costs related to labor, equipment, and maintenance. Cost factors and variables to be considered in the estimates include:

    i. Population size and density of a local jurisdiction;

    ii. Types of households serviced and collection method used;

    iii. Distance from a local jurisdiction to the nearest recycling facility;

    iv. Whether a jurisdiction pays for transportation and sorting of collected materials and whether it receives a commodity value from processed materials;

    ii. Identify methods to consider greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental outcomes associated with potential expansions of curbside recycling services to rural or sparsely populated areas;

e. Compile relevant information to be considered in the development of criteria by the department to determine whether a covered product is recyclable, reusable, or compostable through Washington's curbside recycling collection system. The relevant information to be compiled may include whether covered product materials are:

    i. Or may be, collected, separated, and processed in sufficient quantity and quality into a marketable feedstock that can be used in the production of new products; or

    ii. Designed in a way that is problematic for reuse, recycling, or composting;

f. Evaluate how the state's existing recycling system can be improved in a socially just manner as it relates to activities required under this chapter. The assessment must:

    i. Include meaningful consultation with overburdened communities and vulnerable populations;

    ii. Determine conditions and make recommendations including, at minimum:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) Improving access to the recycling system for women and minority individuals;</p>
<p>(B) The sufficiency of local government requirements related to multifamily recycling services and their implementation;</p>
<p>(C) Identification of activities that disproportionately impact any community and in particular overburdened communities and vulnerable populations;</p>
<p>(D) Improving the sufficiency of recycling education and outreach programs relative to desired socially just management outcomes;</p>
<p>(E) Recommendations for improving socially just management practices and outcomes in the state's recycling system; and</p>
<p>(F) Evaluate the extent to which covered products contribute to litter and marine debris. The assessment should draw on available data, assess gaps, and identify strategies for improving prevention and cleanup of litter and marine debris from covered products; and</p>
<pre><code>g. Compile information from available data sources on the presence of toxic substances in covered products and their potential impacts on reuse, recycling, and composting systems. The information compiled is intended to inform the development of ecomodulation factors that incentivize the reduction of toxic substances that have potentially negative impacts when covered products are managed through reuse, recycling, and composting systems.
