In acknowledgment of students' accomplishments, and the identities and traditions informing their success, the legislature intends to provide public school students with the opportunity to express their cultural heritage at high school commencements and other official graduation ceremonies and events through the wearing of an item or object of cultural significance. The legislature intends also for this policy to bring parity to all cultural groups by allowing them to express cultural pride at commencements and other official graduation ceremonies and events.

School districts shall permit students to wear one item or object of cultural significance with or attached to their gown at high school commencements and other official graduation ceremonies and events.

2. This section governs school operation and management under RCW 28A.710.040 and 28A.715.020 and applies to charter schools established under chapter 28A.710 RCW and state-tribal education compact schools subject to chapter 28A.715 RCW to the same extent as it applies to school districts.

3. Nothing in this section modifies or otherwise effects RCW 28A.600.500.
