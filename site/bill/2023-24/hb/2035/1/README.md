    b. The minor is enrolled in a career and technical education program and the work is performed for an employer approved by the program.

2. For purposes of this section, "career and technical education program" refers to a work-based learning program approved by the office of the superintendent of public instruction or the minor's school district, including but not limited to core plus programs.
