<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that stimulating local investment in solar projects continues to be an important part of the state energy strategy by helping to increase energy independence from fossil fuels, reduce energy burden, promote economic development, hedge against the effects of climate change, create more energy equity, and attain environmental benefits. The legislature finds that the vast majority of Washingtonians still do not have access to the benefits of solar energy. The legislature intends to stimulate the deployment of community solar projects for the benefit of all Washingtonians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to facilitate community solar bill crediting options that can help the state cost-effectively meet the mandates in the Washington state energy code and that are consistent with the goals of the state energy strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to enable and incentivize community solar development in the built environment and on preferred sites, which can reduce transmission and distribution system infrastructure costs and clean energy siting conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that participation of low-income customers in solar projects is consistent with the goals and intent of the energy assistance provisions of chapter 19.405 RCW, the Washington clean energy transformation act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that offering energy assistance through renewable energy programs, including community solar, at a discount to low-income customers is consistent with the goal and intent of RCW 80.28.068.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that participation of low-income customers in community solar projects will support the state by capitalizing on the opportunity created by the federal inflation reduction act. The federal inflation reduction act modifies and extends federal solar tax credits through 2035 and structures them to incentivize investment in disadvantaged and low-income communities and ensure newly created jobs are good paying jobs. This policy is intended to ensure the full benefits of the federal inflation reduction act's provisions for low-income inclusion are realized by enabling fair access to community solar to all Washingtonians.</p>

<p>The value of the electricity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of the project to transmission and distribution capacity, deferred transmission and distribution investments, deferred generation investments and added generation capacity, voltage, reduced system losses, reduced line losses, and ancillary services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of the project to grid reliability and resilience;</p>

<li>
<p>The commission must adopt a valuation methodology for unsubscribed energy. Unsubscribed energy may be rolled forward on a community solar project account until the end of the following calendar year and allocated by a community solar project manager or community solar subscription manager to subscribers at any time during that period. At the end of that period, any undistributed bill credit must be compensated to the community solar project manager.</p>
