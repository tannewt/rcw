# HB 2374 - Washington promise program

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2374.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature intends to establish the Washington promise program to help make the first two years of college affordable and accessible to all citizens of the state of Washington by offering a tuition waiver for eligible students enrolled in associate degree or certificate programs offered by Washington's community and technical colleges. The purposes of the Washington promise program are to encourage more Washington residents to enroll in and successfully complete an associate's degree, workforce training certificate, or apprenticeship program that will lead to opportunities for further education, well-paying jobs, and increased opportunity to reduce intergenerational poverty; and to increase high school graduation and equivalency program completion. By making a postsecondary education credential more affordable and accessible, Washington will make more progress towards the legislature's attainment goal of 70 percent of Washington adults having a postsecondary credential.

The legislature recognizes that increasing the number of residents with associate degrees will lead to increased attainment for higher level degrees as students are encouraged to transfer to comprehensive or research universities.

It is the intent of the legislature to implement the Washington promise program in phases. The legislature recognizes that promise programs are proven to significantly increase high school graduation rates by ensuring all high school graduates know they can attend a community or technical college regardless of their family income. Thus, investment in these programs is an evidence-based means to improve high school graduation rates and to reduce, or even eliminate, opportunity gaps in postsecondary education for students from underrepresented minority groups, low-income students, foster youth, and students with disabilities.

The legislature also recognizes that evidence shows that merely making enrollment free does not address the many obstacles for students to complete a degree or workforce training program. Therefore, the legislature intends for the Washington promise program to include evidence-based supports, including student orientation and success courses, peer mentoring programs, and assistance in meeting such basic needs as food and housing security or child care.

The Washington promise program is intended to provide tuition and other supports to students, filling the gap left from federal Pell grants and other federal financial aid that a student qualifies for upon completion of the free application for federal student aid.

The legislature also finds that increasing the rate of high school students' completion of the free application for federal student aid and Washington application for state financial aid is a necessary component to increasing postsecondary enrollment and attainment. Therefore, the legislature intends for all Washington high school students to complete the free application for federal student aid and the Washington application for state financial aid and receive information on the Washington promise program and Washington college grant prior to high school graduation.
