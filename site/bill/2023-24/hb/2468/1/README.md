# HB 2468 - Concerning the siting of child care facilities.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2468.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that there is a need for more child care facilities in convenient locations for families. Access to affordable and conveniently located child care facilities increases economic growth and labor force participation by reducing commuting times for parents. The vast majority of child care providers are small businesses and nonprofit organizations. The legislature intends to help local governments be more responsive to community needs.

2. Counties and cities are required to make comprehensive plans, development regulations, and zoning choices for development in their communities. Many of these planning laws are inflexible and not easily modified because of the many layers of comprehensive plans, state statutes and rules, local ordinances, and court case precedents that have expanded throughout the decades.

3. The legislature declares that child care centers are a community priority that can be sited near elementary schools in an expedient manner.
