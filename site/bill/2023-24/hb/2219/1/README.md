[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2219.pdf)

## Section 1
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2 and 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2024 (sections 2 and 3 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to provide tax relief for nonprofits that develop and maintain affordable housing and to incentivize the construction of affordable housing, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a) and (e).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to reduce the financial burden of constructing new affordable housing and increase the supply of affordable housing throughout Washington. The legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preferences in this act if a review finds that the construction of affordable housing by nonprofits has increased.

4. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by state, local, and federal governments.
