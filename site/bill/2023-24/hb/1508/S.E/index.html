<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Although the legislature established the health care cost transparency board in 2020 and the board has established a health care cost growth benchmark to monitor cost growth, health care costs and spending continue to rise. According to the health care cost transparency board, research demonstrates that Washington's health care cost trends, particularly hospital and pharmacy costs, outpace other states and the national average;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the commonwealth fund, Washington workers and businesses have seen double-digit increases for employer-based health insurance over the last decade, with the total average premium for a single worker rising by 49 percent and the deductible rising by 51 percent from 2010 through 2020;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to an analysis by the office of the insurance commissioner, health care spending in Washington's commercial market grew by 13 percent from 2016 to 2019, even though inflation grew by only seven percent of this period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the office of financial management, health care spending now accounts for 20 percent of Washington's state general fund budget; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a recent survey by Altarum, more than 60 percent of Washingtonians surveyed in 2022 reported experiencing a health care affordability burden in the last year. More than half of respondents reported delaying or skipping care due to cost. More than 80 percent of respondents said the government should set limits on health care spending growth and penalize payers or providers that fail to curb excessive spending growth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to empower the health care cost transparency board to accelerate its work to analyze the underlying drivers of health care cost growth, and further to take action to address outlier spending that exceeds the health care cost growth benchmark. Such action should be implemented in a progressive manner, such that health care providers and payers are assisted to come into compliance with cost targets, including through technical assistance and performance improvement plans, before assessing fines, unless there are egregious violations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The authority shall establish a board to be known as the health care cost transparency board. The board is responsible for the analysis of total health care expenditures in Washington, identifying trends in health care cost growth, identifying drivers of health care cost growth, and establishing a health care cost growth benchmark. The board shall provide analysis of the factors impacting these trends in health care cost growth and, after review and consultation with identified entities, shall identify those health care providers and payers that are exceeding the health care cost growth benchmark. The board's analysis must be performed by individuals with relevant expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority is authorized to conduct activities necessary to support the activities and decisions of the board, including activities related to data collection and analysis, the provision of technical assistance, and the enforcement of performance improvement plan submissions and the payment of fees and fines issued by the board pursuant to this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>The board has the authority to establish and appoint advisory committees, in accordance with the requirements of RCW 70.390.040, and shall seek input and recommendations from relevant advisory committees in advance of major votes or decisions, unless exigent conditions require otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Determine and require collection from payers and health care providers of the types and sources of data necessary to annually calculate total health care expenditures and health care cost growth,  establish the health care cost growth benchmark, and analyze the impact of cost drivers on health care spending, including execution of any necessary access and data security agreements with the custodians of the data. The board shall first identify existing data sources, such as the statewide health care claims database established in chapter 43.371 RCW and prescription drug data collected under chapter 43.71C RCW, and primarily rely on these sources when possible in order to minimize the creation of new reporting requirements. The board may use data received from existing data sources, including, but not limited to, data collected under chapters 43.70, 43.71, 43.71C, 43.371, and 70.405 RCW, in its analyses and discussions to the same extent that the custodians of the data are permitted to use the data. The board also may use other available data sources, such as medicare cost reports. As appropriate to promote administrative efficiencies, the board may share its data with the prescription drug affordability board under chapter 70.405 RCW and other health care cost analysis efforts conducted by the state. The board shall not require reporting of the same or similar data from a payer or health care provider if the data are available from an existing source;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the means and methods for gathering data to annually calculate total health care expenditures and health care cost growth, and to establish the health care cost growth benchmark. The board must select an appropriate economic indicator to use when establishing the health care cost growth benchmark. By July 1, 2024, the authority, in consultation with the board, shall adopt rules governing the health care cost growth benchmark that will be applicable beginning in 2026. The activities may include selecting methodologies and determining sources of data. The board shall solicit and consider recommendations from the advisory committee on data issues and the health care stakeholder advisory committee  regarding the value and feasibility of reporting various categories of information under (c) of this subsection, such as urban and rural, public sector and private sector, and major categories of health services, including prescription drugs, inpatient treatment, and outpatient treatment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annually calculate total health care expenditures and health care cost growth:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Statewide and by geographic rating area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each health care provider or provider system and each payer, both adjusted and unadjusted for the health status of the patients of the health care provider or the enrollees of the payer, utilization by the patients of the health care provider or the enrollees of the payer, intensity of services provided to the patients of the health care provider or the enrollees of the payer, and regional differences in input prices to the extent data permits. The board may establish, in consultation with the advisory committee on data issues and the health care stakeholder advisory committee, a common risk adjustment methodology for use in relevant analysis. The board must develop an implementation plan for reporting information about health care providers, provider systems, and payers;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Annually establish the health care cost growth benchmark for increases in total health expenditures. The board, in determining the health care cost growth benchmark, shall begin with an initial implementation that applies to the highest cost drivers in the health care system and develop a phased plan to include other components of the health system for subsequent years;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in 2023, analyze the impacts of cost drivers to health care and incorporate this analysis into determining the annual total health care expenditures and establishing the annual health care cost growth benchmark. The cost drivers may include, to the extent such data is available:</p>
