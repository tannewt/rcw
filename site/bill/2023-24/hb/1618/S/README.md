[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1618-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1.

There is no time limitto bring a claim or commence an action by a person for recovery of damages for injury suffered as a result of:

    a. Childhood sexual abuse;

    b. Nonsexual physical abuse by the same perpetrator that occurs concurrently with childhood sexual abuse; or

    c. Sexual abuse that continues beyond the date the child reaches the age of 18 years if the sexual abuse is part of a pattern or a series of childhood sexual abuse by the same perpetrator.

2. As used in this section, "childhood sexual abuse" means any act committed by the defendant against a complainant who was less than eighteen years of age at the time of the act and which act would have been a violation of chapter 9A.44 RCW or RCW 9.68A.040 or prior laws of similar effect at the time the act was committed.

## Section 2
This act is remedial in nature and is to be broadly construed as a nonexclusive remedy for victims of childhood sexual abuse. This act does not eliminate the common law discovery rule for victims of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and exploitation.

## Section 3
This act applies to all claims, causes of actions, and proceedings, regardless of when the claim or cause of action arose. To this extent, this act applies retroactively, but in all other respects it applies prospectively.
