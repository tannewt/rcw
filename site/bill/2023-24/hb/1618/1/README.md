## Section 1
1.

There is no time limit to commence an action based on intentional conduct brought by a person for recovery of damages for injury suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse.

2. As used in this section, "childhood sexual abuse" means any act committed by the defendant against a complainant who was less than eighteen years of age at the time of the act and which act would have been a violation of chapter 9A.44 RCW or RCW 9.68A.040 or prior laws of similar effect at the time the act was committed.

## Section 2
This act applies to all claims, causes of actions, and proceedings, regardless of when the claim or cause of action arose. To this extent, this act applies retroactively, but in all other respects it applies prospectively.
