<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Counties and cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may not impose minimum parking requirements for new residential or commercial developments, except for off-street parking that is permanently marked for the exclusive use of individuals with disabilities, within one-quarter mile based on walking distance, of a major transit stop that receives current or planned level 1, 2, or 3 transit service, as defined in section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county or a city planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may impose minimum parking requirements on an individual project in the circumstances described in subsection (1) of this section, provided that the county or city makes written findings within 30 days of the receipt of a completed application that not imposing or enforcing minimum parking requirements on the development would have a substantially negative impact, supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record, on existing residential or commercial parking within one-half mile of the development project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsection (2) of this section does not apply to a housing development that is within one-quarter mile of an existing or planned transit route that operates no less frequently than two times per hour between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and meets either of the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The housing development dedicates a minimum of 20 percent of the total number of the housing units to very low-income, low-income, or moderate-income households, students, the elderly, or persons with disabilities. Housing units dedicated to very low-income, low-income, or moderate-income households must remain dedicated to very low-income, low-income, or moderate-income households for a minimum of 12 years; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The housing development contains fewer than 20 housing units.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limitations in subsection (1) of this section are intended to encourage transit-oriented development. Therefore, if a project permit application, as defined in RCW 36.70B.020, does not provide parking in compliance with subsection (1) of this section, such fact may not be treated as a basis for the issuance of a determination of significance pursuant to chapter 43.21C RCW.</p>
