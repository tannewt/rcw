# HB 1876 - Concerning confidential fisheries information collected by other states and maintaining that confidentiality under the public records act.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1876.pdf)

## Section 1
Fishery data and recordkeeping occurs primarily at the state level on the west coast, but many fishers participate in multiple fisheries along the coast and deliver their catches into multiple states. Coastal states regularly share confidential data to ensure regulations are enforced, to understand fisheries performance, and to analyze the need for and likely effects of potential rule changes. The goal of this act is to expressly authorize the department of fish and wildlife to protect data received from other coastal states if that data is confidential under the originating state's laws.

## Section 2
The following information relating to fish and wildlife is exempt from disclosure under this chapter:

1. Commercial fishing catch data from logbooks required to be provided to the department of fish and wildlife under RCW 77.12.047, when the data identifies specific catch location, timing, or methodology and the release of which would result in unfair competitive disadvantage to the commercial fisher providing the catch data, however, this information may be released to government agencies concerned with the management of fish and wildlife resources;

2. Sensitive fish and wildlife data. Sensitive fish and wildlife data may be released to the following entities and their agents for fish, wildlife, land management purposes, or scientific research needs: Government agencies, public utilities, and accredited colleges and universities.
