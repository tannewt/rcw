<h2 id="section-101">Section 101 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-101">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that providing all public school students with access to meals served without charge each school day will support academic success and promote student well-being. The legislature, in support of students, families, and productive learning environments, and in recognition of financial challenges that can create barriers to academic achievement, declares that no student should ever experience hunger or food insecurity within a public school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to make the provision of breakfast and lunch to all requesting students and without charge to those students, part of the state's statutory program of basic education that is deemed by the legislature to implement Article IX, section 1 of the state Constitution. The legislature further intends for this policy to be implemented without adversely or otherwise impacting programs that use free and reduced-price meal eligibility information for determining program eligibility, the distribution of financial resources, or both.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-102">Section 102 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-102">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The program of basic education established under this chapter is deemed by the legislature to comply with the requirements of Article IX, section 1 of the state Constitution, which states that &quot;It is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex,&quot; and is adopted pursuant to Article IX, section 2 of the state Constitution, which states that &quot;The legislature shall provide for a general and uniform system of public schools.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature defines the program of basic education under this chapter as that which is necessary to provide the opportunity to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to meet the state-established high school graduation requirements that are intended to allow students to have the opportunity to graduate with a meaningful diploma that prepares them for postsecondary education, gainful employment, and citizenship. Basic education by necessity is an evolving program of instruction intended to reflect the changing educational opportunities that are needed to equip students for their role as productive citizens and includes the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The instructional program of basic education the minimum components of which are described in RCW 28A.150.220;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program of education provided by chapter 28A.190 RCW for students in residential schools as defined by RCW 28A.190.005 and for juveniles in detention facilities as identified by RCW 28A.190.010;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program of education provided by chapter 28A.193 RCW for individuals under the age of eighteen who are incarcerated in adult correctional facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transportation and transportation services to and from school for eligible students as provided under RCW 28A.160.150 through 28A.160.180;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statewide salary allocations necessary to hire and retain qualified staff for the state's statutory program of basic education; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meals provided at no charge to students under section 103 of this act.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning with the 2023-24 school year, each school district shall provide breakfast and lunch each school day to any student who requests a breakfast, lunch, or both. The school district must provide the meals at no charge to the student and without consideration of the student's eligibility for a federally reimbursed free or reduced-price meal. Meals provided under this section must be nutritiously adequate and qualify for federal reimbursement under the school lunch program or the school breakfast program, and students are not eligible for more than one meal in a meal service period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall reimburse school districts on a per-meal reimbursement basis for meals that are not already reimbursed at the United States department of agriculture's free rate. The additional state reimbursement amount must be the difference between the United States department of agriculture's free rate and the United States department of agriculture's paid rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until the 2025-26 school year, the superintendent of public instruction may exempt school districts from the requirements of this section under RCW 28A.235.160.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To maximize federal funding, school districts, beginning with the 2023-24 school year, must participate in the United States department of agriculture's school lunch program and school breakfast program, continue collecting free and reduced-price meal eligibility applications where applicable, and run direct certification at least monthly in accordance with RCW 28A.235.280. School districts shall also annually monitor data for eligibility in the United States department of agriculture community eligibility provision and apply where eligible as required in RCW 28A.235.300.</p>

Nothing in this section requires school districts to maintain a particular classroom teacher-to-student ratio or other staff-to-student ratio or to use allocated funds to pay for particular types or classifications of staff. Nothing in this section entitles an individual teacher to a particular teacher planning period.</p>

<p>To promote transparency in state funding allocations, the superintendent of public instruction must report state per-pupil allocations for each school district for the general apportionment, special education, learning assistance, transitional bilingual, highly capable, and career and technical education programs. The superintendent must report this information in a user-friendly format on the main page of the office's website. School districts must include a link to the superintendent's per-pupil allocations report on the main page of the school district's website.

<p>To the extent the technical details of the formula have been adopted by the legislature and except when specifically provided as a school district allocation, the distribution formula for the basic education instructional allocation shall be based on minimum staffing and nonstaff costs the legislature deems necessary to support instruction and operations in prototypical schools serving high, middle, and elementary school students as provided in this section. The use of prototypical schools for the distribution formula does not constitute legislative intent that schools should be operated or structured in a similar fashion as the prototypes. Prototypical schools illustrate the level of resources needed to operate a school of a particular size with particular types and grade levels of students using commonly understood terms and inputs, such as class size, hours of instruction, and various categories of school staff. It is the intent that the funding allocations to school districts be adjusted from the school prototypes based on the actual number of annual average full-time equivalent students in each grade level at each school in the district and not based on the grade-level configuration of the school to the extent that data is available. The allocations shall be further adjusted from the school prototypes with minimum allocations for small schools and to reflect other factors identified in the omnibus appropriations act.</p>

Nothing in this section requires school districts to maintain a particular classroom teacher-to-student ratio or other staff-to-student ratio or to use allocated funds to pay for particular types or classifications of staff. Nothing in this section entitles an individual teacher to a particular teacher planning period.</p>

<li>
<p>To promote transparency in state funding allocations, the superintendent of public instruction must report state per-pupil allocations for each school district for the general apportionment, special education, learning assistance, transitional bilingual, highly capable, and career and technical education programs. The superintendent must report this information in a user-friendly format on the main page of the office's website. School districts must include a link to the superintendent's per-pupil allocations report on the main page of the school district's website. In addition, the budget documents published by the legislature for the enacted omnibus operating appropriations act must report statewide average per-pupil allocations for general apportionment and the categorical programs listed in this subsection.</p>

<p>To the extent the technical details of the formula have been adopted by the legislature and except when specifically provided as a school district allocation, the distribution formula for the basic education instructional allocation shall be based on minimum staffing and nonstaff costs the legislature deems necessary to support instruction and operations in prototypical schools serving high, middle, and elementary school students as provided in this section. The use of prototypical schools for the distribution formula does not constitute legislative intent that schools should be operated or structured in a similar fashion as the prototypes. Prototypical schools illustrate the level of resources needed to operate a school of a particular size with particular types and grade levels of students using commonly understood terms and inputs, such as class size, hours of instruction, and various categories of school staff. It is the intent that the funding allocations to school districts be adjusted from the school prototypes based on the actual number of annual average full-time equivalent students in each grade level at each school in the district and not based on the grade-level configuration of the school to the extent that data is available. The allocations shall be further adjusted from the school prototypes with minimum allocations for small schools and to reflect other factors identified in the omnibus appropriations act.</p>
