# HB 1391 - Energy in buildings

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1391-S2.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes the findings in the 2021 state energy strategy, which reports that improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most cost-effective means to meet the state's emissions and energy goals for buildings. While there have been significant energy efficiency savings achieved in the state over the past four decades, there remains enormous potential to achieve even greater savings in existing buildings. Increasing access to energy efficiency improvements, such as weatherization measures and installation of highly efficient electric appliances, in residential and nonresidential buildings achieves many benefits including reducing energy bills, avoiding the need for new electricity generating facilities and electricity transmission, and creating living wage jobs.

The legislature also recognizes the 2021 state energy strategy's electrification scenario findings that the amount of fossil natural gas delivered to buildings must be reduced by 90 percent from 2020 to 2050 to meet the state's emissions limits. The electrification scenario indicates substantial near-term and long-term benefits from energy reduction measures in buildings. This points to the value of early and aggressive action to improve energy efficiency, including electrification and other efficiency measures in buildings. Implementing multiple measures simultaneously in each building and achieving a high level of market penetrations will achieve economies of scale and help lower costs of energy upgrades.

Furthermore, in order to put the state on a pathway to meeting the emissions limits as outlined in RCW 70A.45.020, the strategy recommends widespread conversion of fossil fuel end uses to electricity, to deploy more demand responsive and energy efficiency technologies, and to increase the supply of electricity from renewable energy.

The 2022 report to the legislature on state weatherization plus health programs recommends the state provide funding to expand the suite of weatherization and community energy efficiency program services statewide, prioritizing multifamily housing, fossil fuel-heated housing, and high energy burden communities.

It is the intent of the legislature that financial and technical assistance programs be expanded to direct local, state, and federal funds as well as electric and natural gas utility funding towards greater achievement of energy efficiency improvements. To this end, the legislature establishes a policy goal of providing cost-effective electrification and energy efficiency services to the state's residential and commercial buildings over the next 10 years. The legislature also intends to attain this goal in part through supporting programs for state registered apprenticeship programs and other clean energy career pathway programs, and that there is a maximum living wage job creation in fields related to building energy retrofits.

By leveraging state resources available through the climate commitment act, the legislature intends to rapidly leverage the various funding streams created in the federal inflation reduction act and the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act and ensure that our state has projects ready and optimizes all available federal resources. Washington's approach to this work will ensure that low-income and moderate-income Washingtonians can fully benefit from federal investment.

    b. The department must ensure the requirements of the navigator program are being met through the contract terms with the administrator or administrators. The department must include performance metrics in any administrator's contract that are sufficient to allow the department, the legislature, and the technical advisory group established in section 4 of this act to evaluate the energy savings, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, consumer cost savings, wage and employment impacts,including opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses, services delivered to low-income and overburdened communities, nonenergy benefits, and customer satisfaction resulting from the administrator's operation of the navigator program.

    c. The department must enter into a contract with an administrator or administrators by March 1, 2024. The legislature intends for the administrator or administrators to begin providing as many of the services outlined in this section as possible immediately and recognizes that it may take more time for some services to be provided than others. Therefore, the administrator or administrators must first focus on providing clear education and community outreach to customers on navigating through relevant funding opportunities and leverage existing energy utility programs.

    c. The department's report to the legislature is due by September 1st of even-numbered years.

11. Nothing in this section may supplant energy efficiency programs administered by energy utilities.

## Section 4
1. The department must convene a technical advisory group by December 1, 2023, to provide ongoing guidance to the statewide building energy upgrade navigator program established in section 3 of this act. The technical advisory group's guidance must include recommendations on how to continuously improve and grow the program, address any gaps in program design and implementation, address split incentives, and how to incorporate the department of health's environmental health disparities mapping tool into the work of the navigator program.

2. The technical advisory group must make recommendations regarding workforce development, contractor needs, and needed training curriculum.

3. The technical advisory group may recommend expanding the size of the projects to buildings above 20,000 square feet, including schools, which would potentially be paired with adding consolidated labor standards.

4. In consultation with the evaluation in section 3(6) of this act, the technical advisory group must make recommendations about how to ensure that projects supported by the navigator program pay workers at least a rate consistent with the prevailing rate of wage pursuant to RCW 39.12.010 and to ensure there is a pathway for small businesses and minority and women-owned contractors to comply with program requirements.

5. Technical advisory group members must be appointed by the department. The department must strive to appoint members representing the geographical diversity of the state. Membership must consist of the following:

    a. Seven members representing low-income and overburdened communities to include:

        i. Five from community-based organizations that represent communities disproportionately burdened by pollution and environmental hazards;
