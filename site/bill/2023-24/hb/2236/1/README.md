[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2236.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that career and technical education core plus programs have demonstrated innovation and success in providing meaningful benefits to students and employers though collaborative, education-based partnerships that serve as a model for work-integrated learning in Washington. For more than a decade, these programs, and the rigorous career and technical education curricula they incorporate, have prepared students for structured pathways to employment, and presented employers with an expanded pool of candidates with relevant skills and abilities.

2. Career and technical education core plus programs have been established in three sectors: Aerospace and advanced manufacturing; construction; and maritime. These programs, which have been strongly supported by leaders in vital Washington industries, have provided unprecedented education and work-integrated learning opportunities to students. The work remains unfinished, however, as state law envisions that these successes can be expanded to additional programs in health care and information technology.

3. Regardless of the sector, continual collaboration between education and industry partners have guided the establishment and operation of career and technical education core plus programs. These joint efforts have: Focused on adopting age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate curricula; featured employer-supported professional development for teachers; and featured employer-provided worksite-based learning experiences for students and teachers. These elements are instrumental to the success of ongoing programs and offer a strong framework for establishing programs in other industry sectors.

4. The legislature, therefore, intends to initiate a process for: (a) Soliciting expert recommendations for a career and technical education core plus model framework that can be used to guide the establishment and operation of successful programs in other sectors, and the expansion of operational programs; and (b) establishing a career and technical education core plus program for allied health professions that is responsive to the needs of students, teachers, employers, and communities.
