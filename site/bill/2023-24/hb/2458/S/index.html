<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning with the 2023 regular legislative session, and every four years thereafter, the legislature shall review and rebase state basic education compensation allocations compared to school district compensation data, regionalization factors, what inflationary measure is the most representative of actual market experience for school districts, and other economic information. The legislature shall revise the minimum allocations, regionalization factors, and inflationary measure if necessary to ensure that state basic education allocations continue to provide market-rate salaries and that regionalization adjustments reflect actual economic differences between school districts.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the regionalization factors specified in this subsection, for school districts that have certificated instructional staff median years of experience that exceed the statewide average certificated instructional staff years of experience and a ratio of certificated instructional staff advanced degrees to bachelor degrees above the statewide ratio, an experience factor of four percentage points is added to the regionalization factor.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) For school districts with fewer than 12,000 students enrolled and at least eight percent of students identified as eligible for the transitional bilingual instruction program, the number of students identified as eligible for the transitional bilingual instruction program divided by the total number of students, multiplied by 10, rounded to the nearest whole number;</p>
<p>(B) For school districts with 12,000 or more students enrolled and at least 30 percent of students identified as eligible for the transitional bilingual instruction program, the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, of (c)(i)(B)(I) of this subsection multiplied by (c)(i)(B)(II) of this subsection multiplied by (c)(i)(B)(III) of this subsection, is added to the median years of experience;</p>
<p>(I) The number of students identified as eligible for the transitional bilingual instruction program divided by the total number of students;</p>
<p>(II) The enrollment of the school district with the largest enrollment minus the enrollment of the school district, divided by the enrollment of the school district with the largest enrollment minus 12,000;</p>
<p>(III) 10.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. The following are added to a school district's ratio of certificated instructional staff advanced degrees to bachelor degrees for purposes of calculating eligibility for the experience factor under this subsection (2)(c):

<p>(A) For school districts with fewer than 12,000 students enrolled, the number of students identified as homeless divided by the total number of students;</p>
<p>(B) For school districts with 12,000 or more students enrolled, the product of (c)(ii)(B)(I) of this subsection multiplied by (c)(ii)(B)(II) of this subsection:</p>
<p>(I) The number of students identified as homeless divided by the total number of students;</p>
<p>(II) The enrollment of the school district with the largest enrollment minus the enrollment of the school district, divided by the enrollment of the school district with the largest enrollment minus 12,000.</p>
<pre><code>    iii. School district enrollments used to calculate amounts under (c)(i) and (ii) of this subsection must be based on 2023-24 enrollment data published on the Washington state report card website as of February 1, 2024.

    iv. For school districts not eligible for the four percentage points experience factor under this subsection (c), but eligible in the previous school year, the experience factor is reduced to two percentage points.

v. Beginning in the 2024-25 school year, school districts not eligible for the four percentage points experience factor under this subsection (c) for two consecutive years that were eligible two school years prior receive an experience factor of one percentage point.
