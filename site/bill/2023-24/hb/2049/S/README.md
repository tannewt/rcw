# HB 2049 - Solid waste management

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2049-S.pdf)

## Section 101
2. The legislature finds that packaging designs and materials have changed and the way Washington's residents use, consume, and manage materials when no longer wanted has also changed significantly in recent years. These shifts contributed to unintended consequences, such as the deterioration of ecosystems regionally and worldwide, as well as increased levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change, and reductions in human well-being, especially for the most vulnerable populations.

3. The legislature finds that convenient and environmentally sound extended producer responsibility programs that include the collection, transportation, reuse, and recycling, and the proper end-of-life management of unwanted products help protect Washington's environment and the health of state residents. In general, the state's waste management hierarchy establishes that products should be managed in a manner where a priority is placed on waste reduction, reuse, and recycling over energy recovery and landfill disposal.

4. The legislature finds that many residents, particularly those who live in rural areas and in multifamily residences, do not have access to convenient or affordable curbside recycling, and must rely on taking recyclables to drop box locations, and that extended producer responsibility programs could make curbside recycling available and affordable for most people in the state.

5. The legislature also finds that the department of ecology was directed, through an independent consultant, to study how plastic packaging is managed in the state and assess various policy options. The study recommended, in part: (a) An extended producer responsibility policy for all consumer packaging and paper products with a framework that makes producers responsible for achieving specific environmental outcomes for the packaging and paper products they supply into Washington state; and (b) postconsumer recycled content requirements.

6. In addition, the legislature finds extended producer responsibility policies designed to cover all consumer packaging and paper materials offer the potential for greater economies of scale and operational efficiencies than could be achieved under a policy applied only to a subset of materials.

7. It is the intent of the legislature to require extended producer responsibility programs for consumer packaging and paper products be implemented in a manner that involves producers in material management from design concept to end of life. These programs incentivize innovation and research to develop new and more efficient recycling and reuse technologies and minimize negative environmental impacts of the packaging and paper products.

8. It is intended that these programs be responsibly planned and funded, so that covered products are handled and accounted for from the point of collection through the final destination in a way that minimizes negative impacts to the environment and minimizes risks to public health and worker health and safety. It is also intended that these programs build and expand on the existing waste and recycling system's infrastructure and reliance on the authority of local governments and the utilities and transportation commission in solid waste management.

9. It is the intent of the legislature that producers increase the use of postconsumer recycled content in their products, to achieve the goals in RCW 70A.520.010(2) and to create strong markets for recycled materials and achieve environmental benefits.

10. It is the intent of the legislature that, through design and innovation, producers will reduce the use and negative climate impact of consumer packaging and paper products and increase the use of postconsumer recycled content.

11. Finally, it is the intent of the legislature that Washington should maintain the successful public-private partnership between state, local government, and solid waste and recycling service providers. The legislature does not intend to diminish or displace the primary role of the utilities and transportation commission and local governments in regulating or contracting directly with service providers for the curbside collection of residential recyclables. Local governments maintain their existing authority to collect, contract for collection with solid waste and recycling service providers, or defer to solid waste collection services regulated by the utilities and transportation commission.

Material recovery facilities and other processing facilities handling materials under this chapter shall prioritize agreements with and on behalf of producers or producer responsibility organizations regarding long-term contracts and other purchase agreements based on fair market pricing for commodities of comparable quality.

## Section 111
1. Any producer responsibility organization plan submitted to the department must include performance rates for covered products reported by the producer responsibility organization as supplied into the state, taking into account the findings of the December 2023 Washington Recycling, Reuse, and Source Reduction Target Study and Community Input Process, statewide needs assessment, and additional relevant data. The rates submitted by a producer responsibility organization must be achieved by the end of the plan implementation period.

    a. At minimum, the plan must include the following performance rates averages across all covered products within a registered producer responsibility organization:

        i. An overall recycling rate of covered products;

        ii. Beginning with the second plan, a separate minimum reuse rate of covered products;

        iii. A recycling rate for each material category of covered products reported by the producer responsibility organization as supplied into the state; and

        iv. A source reduction rate to be achieved by the elimination of covered product components or a reduction in the weight of covered products, with at least 25 percent of the total rate being achieved by solely eliminating plastic components. The elimination of a plastic component must not render the covered material detrimental to recycling or nonrecyclables. This source reduction rate must calculate the amount of covered material the producers have source reduced since January 1, 2013.

    b. Proposed rates must demonstrate continuous improvement in performance rates of covered products over time, until the department determines that a maximum level of technically achievable process has been achieved.

    c. Proposed rates must adhere to the performance rate calculation methodology established in subsections (2) through (4) of this section.

    d. Proposed rates must be justified, if they are different from those recommended in the most recent performance rates study.

3. To be included in a performance rate calculation for purposes of this chapter, recycled materials must be transferred to a responsible end market.

4. For purposes of calculations of reuse and elimination under this section, a producer responsibility organization must include both the weight and number of units.

## Section 112
1. A producer responsibility organization implementing a plan must fully fund all activities required under this chapter.

2. A nonreimbursable point-of-sale fee may not be charged to consumers to recoup the costs of meeting producer obligations under this chapter.

3. [Empty]

    a. A producer responsibility organization must develop a system to collect fees from participating producers to cover the costs of plan implementation. To minimize the administrative and reporting costs of the producers and the organization, the fee system must include a category of small producers, determined by weight of covered products sold into the state, for whom no fees are charged by the producer responsibility organization.

    b. The fee system may include:

        i. Additional charges applied specifically to producers of postconsumer recycled content products covered by the requirements of chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 502 of this act), in an amount roughly equivalent to fully cover the producer responsibility organization's costs of implementing its duties under chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 502 of this act), including funding the oversight of the department; and

        ii. An optional flat rate for producers below a certain size.

    c. A producer responsibility organization shall allow producers of covered products that are magazines to satisfy their obligations under this section by providing advertisement or publication supporting the education and outreach activities required under section 118 of this act in their magazines, or on their websites in lieu of program fees as long as the value of the advertisement is equivalent to the estimated cost of managing the covered products that are magazines, which are to be determined as described in subsection (4) of this section. The producer responsibility organization may consider the in-state reach of the advertising when determining the value of the advertising.

4. The fee system must include a base rate, based upon the estimated cost of managing the material categories of covered products, while seeking to avoid a material category that subsidizes any other material category. The base rate must be proportional to the costs to the producer responsibility organization for that covered product type, material, or format. In establishing the base rate, a producer responsibility organization must consider the following factors:

    a. The total annual amount of covered products sold or supplied into the state, by material category, whether or not the material is currently recyclable or designated for collection for recycling;

    b. The material characteristics and the costs associated with the management of each material category; and

    c. The commodity value of each material category as a recycled material.

5. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the base rate charged under subsection (4) of this section, the fee system must use eco-modulation factors to incentivize the use of packaging design attributes that reduce the negative environmental impacts of covered products. The factors must include both positive incentives, including discounted fees, and disincentives, including increased fees. Examples of activities that a fee system may include to satisfy the requirement to use eco-modulation factors include, but are not limited to:

        i. Encourage designs that facilitate and improve infrastructure and systems for reuse, recycling, and home and industrial composting, and that achieve reuse, recycling, and home and industrial composting;

        ii. Encourage the use of postconsumer recycled content;

        iii. Encourage designs that reduce the amount of packaging material used;

        iv. Discourage the use of problematic or difficult to recycle materials that increase system costs of managing covered products; and

    v. Encourage other design attributes that reduce the climate and other negative environmental impacts of covered products.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Any system of program fees under this section that includes discounted fees or favorable treatment of covered products deemed to be reusable must establish a basis for determining that products, in practice, are designed and supported by adequate infrastructure to ensure they are reused multiple times as part of a system of reuse.

        ii. Any system of program fees under this section must consider and provide fair treatment to instances in which federal regulations constrain the use of packaging design attributes that reduce the negative environmental impacts of covered products.

    c. Fees collected under this fee system must be used exclusively for plan implementation and other activities required under this chapter and chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 502 of this act).

6. If more than one producer responsibility organization is registered within the state, each producer responsibility organization must coordinate with other producer responsibility organizations to provide reimbursement and ensure that government entities and service providers are reimbursed for recycling services as required under this chapter, and to ensure that covered products are not reported as supplied or managed by more than one producer responsibility organization.

7. [Empty]

    a. Each producer responsibility organization must fund, through a fee paid to the department, the costs to the department to establish and implement a packaging financial assistance program to reduce the negative environmental impacts of covered products through reuse. The fee charged to any producer responsibility organization may not exceed:

        i. $5,000,000 each year, beginning with the year of producer responsibility organization registration with the department under section 103 of this act through the year 2028;

        ii. Four percent of the three-year average of the organization's annual expenditures, excluding payments of the fee established under this section, as described in the organizations' annual reports submitted under section 119 of this act, beginning in 2029.

    b. Fees to administer the packaging financial assistance program collected under this subsection must be deposited in the packaging financial assistance account created in section 128 of this act.

    c. Entities eligible for financial assistance include, but are not limited to:

        i. Government entities;

        ii. Tribal governments;

        iii. Nonprofit organizations; and

        iv. Private organizations, if the department determines that the money would be used to support the goals of this chapter.

    d. In providing financial assistance for programs under this section, the department must consider criteria that includes, but is not limited to:

        i. The environmental benefits of the program;

        ii. The human health benefits of the program;

        iii. The social and economic benefits of the program;

        iv. The cost-effectiveness of the program; and

    v. The needs of economically distressed or overburdened communities.

## Section 113
1. In every jurisdiction in which covered products are sold or supplied to consumers, a producer responsibility organization must fund activities to make convenient collection services available for the lists of covered products designated for collection by the department as described in section 107 of this act. Convenient collection services must be available to residents as follows:

    a. Curbside collection of materials identified as suitable for residential curbside collection must be provided to residents in single-family and multifamily residences wherever curbside garbage collection services are provided to these entities, except where a county has adopted an ordinance that designates that these materials must be collected exclusively through drop-off locations as allowed in section 114 of this act.

    b. Collection of materials identified as suitable for drop-off collection must be provided through free and equitable access to permanent collection facilities that are located, at minimum, at each solid waste transfer, processing, or disposal site, or other drop-off location, or a location demonstrated to the department to be of equal convenience, that existed prior to the effective date of this section.

    c. Collection of materials identified as suitable for alternative collection only must be provided through collection services that provide free and equitable access to residents at a minimum:

        i. Consistent with the requirements described in (b) of this subsection applicable to materials suitable for drop-off collection; and

        ii. In communities that are not covered by a collection location described in (c)(i) of this subsection. A producer responsibility organization, after soliciting and accommodating input from the department, the relevant government entity, and the local community, must determine a reasonable number and location of additional drop-off locations or frequency and location of collection events or services to be provided in underserved areas. A producer responsibility organization must give special consideration for providing opportunities to island and geographically isolated populations.

    d. A retail establishment may choose to serve as a drop-off location or as the site of a collection event, or both, through mutual agreement with a producer responsibility organization, but nothing in this chapter requires a retail establishment to serve as a drop-off location or site of a collection event.

    e. For the duration of the initial plan implementation term, collection must be provided in the following public places:

        i. Any location where government entities provided and managed recycling collection receptacles as of July 1, 2024.

## Section 301
The legislature finds:

1. Continuing technological changes in methods of manufacture, packaging, and marketing of consumer products, together with the economic and population growth of this state, the rising affluence of its citizens, and its expanding industrial activity have created new and ever-mounting problems involving disposal of garbage, refuse, and solid waste materials resulting from domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities.

2. Traditional methods of disposing of solid wastes in this state are no longer adequate to meet the ever-increasing problem. Improper methods and practices of handling and disposal of solid wastes pollute our land, air and water resources, blight our countryside, adversely affect land values, and damage the overall quality of our environment.

3. Considerations of natural resource limitations, energy shortages, economics and the environment make necessary the development and implementation of solid waste recovery and/or recycling plans and programs.

4. Waste reduction must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. It is therefore necessary to change manufacturing and purchasing practices and waste generation behaviors to reduce the amount of waste that becomes a governmental responsibility.

5. Source separation of waste must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. Collection and handling strategies should have, as an ultimate goal, the source separation of all materials with resource value or environmental hazard.

6. [Empty]

    a. It should be the goal of every person and business to minimize their production of wastes and to separate recyclable or hazardous materials from mixed waste.

    b. It is the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to provide for a waste management infrastructure to fully implement waste reduction and source separation strategies and to process and dispose of remaining wastes in a manner that is environmentally safe and economically sound. It is further the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to monitor the cost-effectiveness and environmental safety of combusting separated waste, processing mixed municipal solid waste, and recycling programs.

    c. It is the responsibility of county and city governments to assume primary responsibility for solid waste management and to develop and implement aggressive and effective waste reduction and source separation strategies.

    d. It is the responsibility of state government to ensure that local governments are providing adequate source reduction and separation opportunities and incentives to all, including persons in both rural and urban areas, and nonresidential waste generators such as commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, recognizing the need to provide flexibility to accommodate differing population densities, distances to and availability of recycling markets, and collection and disposal costs in each community; and to provide county and city governments with adequate technical resources to accomplish this responsibility.

    e. It is the responsibility of producers to help provide for the responsible management of their products.

7. Environmental and economic considerations in solving the state's solid waste management problems requires strong consideration by local governments of regional solutions and intergovernmental cooperation.

8. The following priorities for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste are necessary and should be followed in descending order as applicable:

    a. Waste reduction;

    b. Recycling, with source separation of recyclable materials as the preferred method;

    c. Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of separated waste;

    d. Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of mixed municipal solid wastes.

9. It is the state's goal to achieve a 50 percent recycling rate by 2007.

10. It is the state's goal that programs be established to eliminate residential or commercial yard debris in landfills by 2012 in those areas where alternatives to disposal are readily available and effective.

11. Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal.

12. It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed.

13. Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued.

14. Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided.

15. Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste.

16. All governmental entities in the state should set an example by implementing aggressive waste reduction and recycling programs at their workplaces and by purchasing products that are made from recycled materials and are recyclable.

17. To ensure the safe and efficient operations of solid waste disposal facilities, it is necessary for operators and regulators of landfills and incinerators to receive training and certification.

18. It is necessary to provide adequate funding to all levels of government so that successful waste reduction and recycling programs can be implemented.

19. The development of stable and expanding markets for recyclable materials is critical to the long-term success of the state's recycling goals. Market development must be encouraged on a state, regional, and national basis to maximize its effectiveness. The state shall assume primary responsibility for the development of a multifaceted market development program to carry out the purposes of chapter 431, Laws of 1989.

20. There is an imperative need to anticipate, plan for, and accomplish effective storage, control, recovery, and recycling of discarded tires and other problem wastes with the subsequent conservation of resources and energy.

## Section 302
1. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive statewide program for solid waste handling, and solid waste recovery and/or recycling which will prevent land, air, and water pollution and conserve the natural, economic, and energy resources of this state. To this end it is the purpose of this chapter:

    a. To assign primary responsibility for adequate solid waste handling to local government, reserving to the state, however, those functions necessary to assure effective programs throughout the state;

    b. To provide for adequate planning for solid waste handling by local government;

    c. To provide for the adoption and enforcement of basic minimum performance standards for solid waste handling, including that all sites where recyclable materials are generated and transported from shall provide a separate container for solid waste;

    d. To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling, to promote consistency in the requirements for such facilities throughout the state, and to ensure that recyclable materials diverted from the waste stream for recycling are routed to facilities in which recycling occurs;

    e. To provide technical and financial assistance to local governments in the planning, development, and conduct of solid waste handling programs;

    f. To encourage storage, proper disposal, and recycling of discarded vehicle tires and to stimulate private recycling programs throughout the state;

    g. To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities and activities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling and to promote consistency in the permitting requirements for such facilities and activities throughout the state; and

    h. To assign producer responsibility for covered products under chapters 70A.500, 70A.505, 70A.510, 70A.515, 70A.550, 69.48, and 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 501 of this act).

2. It is the intent of the legislature that local governments be encouraged to use the expertise of private industry and to contract with private industry to the fullest extent possible to carry out solid waste recovery and/or recycling programs.
