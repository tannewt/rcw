<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that supporting and preparing incarcerated persons to successfully reenter the community is critical to recognizing the dignity of all incarcerated persons, while also reducing recidivism and expanding the state's trained and skilled workforce. To that end, the legislature intends to improve the quality and availability of construction-related training programs in state correctional facilities in order to strengthen pathways for incarcerated persons to advance from those programs to state registered apprenticeship programs upon reentering the community. These improvements will expand access to living wage jobs for formerly incarcerated persons, increase the construction workforce, and support federal and state investments in transportation infrastructure and clean energy. Therefore, the legislature hereby directs the office of the corrections ombuds to convene an oversight committee for the purpose of facilitating critical changes to state correctional programming. The oversight committee will evaluate, strengthen, and expand construction-related training programs, with a focus on state recognized apprenticeship preparation programs, and transition planning with the goal of improving pathways to the enrollment of formerly incarcerated persons in state registered apprenticeship programs.</p>
