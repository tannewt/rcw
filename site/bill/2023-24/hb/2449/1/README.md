## Section 2
The professional health care services rate enhancement account is created in the state treasury.

Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation as provided in this chapter. Expenditures from the account may be used only for medicaid professional service rates in accordance with this chapter as follows: To make payments to health care providers and managed care organizations as specified in this chapter; and to medicaid managed care organizations for funding the nonfederal share of increased capitation payments.

## Section 3

Rates for subsequent years shall be annually adjusted based on the inflation factor.

The authority shall direct payments from managed care organizations to health care providers.

2. Before making payments under this section, the authority shall modify its contracts with managed care organizations or otherwise require:

    a. Payment of the entire amount payable to health care providers as directed by the authority under subsection (3) of this section, less an allowance for premium taxes the organization is required to pay under Title 48 RCW and for funding the nonfederal share of increased capitation payments based on their projected assessment under this chapter;

    b. That payments to health care providers be made as part of the contracted reimbursement process;

    c. That any delegation or attempted delegation of an organization's obligations under agreements with the authority does not relieve the organization of its obligations under this section and related contract provisions; and

3. If federal restrictions prevent the full amount of payments under this section from being delivered to any class or classes of health care provider, the health care authority, in consultation with the Washington state medical association, will alter payment rates for medicaid professional services.

4. If a managed care organization is legally obligated to repay the state or federal government amounts distributed to health care providers under this section, it may recoup the amount it is obligated to repay from individual health care providers under the medicaid program by not more than the amount of overpayment each health care provider received from that managed care organization.
