<p>For diesel, calculate the annual average by using the sum of the price of the allowances sold during the year divided by the number of allowances sold to represent the price per metric ton. Multiply that amount by 0.010180. Next, multiply the resulting amount by 0.95 and it will provide the cents per gallon.</p>
