<li>
<p>If the department determines that an individual recommended as level I does not meet the criteria for relief from lifetime community custody, or can identify a specific safety concern, the department shall send the individual's case file to the board for review. The department may make a referral to the board for review of a level I at least 90 days prior to discharge from community custody if the department has reasonable grounds to believe the person poses a significant risk of sexual recidivism.</p>

<p>An offender is eligible for the special sex offender sentencing alternative if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The offender has been convicted of a sex offense other than a violation of RCW 9A.44.050 or a sex offense that is also a serious violent offense. If the conviction results from a guilty plea, the offender must, as part of his or her plea of guilty, voluntarily and affirmatively admit he or she committed all of the elements of the crime to which the offender is pleading guilty. This alternative is not available to offenders who plead guilty to the offense charged under , 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970) and, 87 Wash.2d 363, 552 P.2d 682 (1976);</p>

<li>
<p>The offender has no prior convictions for a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 or any other felony sex offenses in this or any other state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offender has no prior adult convictions for a violent offense that was committed within five years of the date the current offense was committed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offense did not result in substantial bodily harm to the victim;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offender had an established relationship with, or connection to, the victim such that the sole connection with the victim was not the commission of the crime; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offender's standard sentence range for the offense includes the possibility of confinement for less than eleven years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds the offender is eligible for this alternative, the court, on its own motion or the motion of the state or the offender, may order an examination to determine whether the offender is amenable to treatment.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The report of the examination shall include at a minimum the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The offender's version of the facts and the official version of the facts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offender's offense history;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of problems in addition to alleged deviant behaviors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offender's social and employment situation; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other evaluation measures used.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The report shall set forth the sources of the examiner's information.</p>
<pre><code>b. The examiner shall assess and report regarding the offender's amenability to treatment and relative risk to the community. A proposed treatment plan shall be provided and shall include, at a minimum:

    i. Frequency and type of contact between offender and therapist;

    ii. Specific issues to be addressed in the treatment and description of planned treatment modalities;

    iii. Monitoring plans, including any requirements regarding living conditions, lifestyle requirements, and monitoring by family members and others;

    iv. Anticipated length of treatment; and

v. Recommended crime-related prohibitions and affirmative conditions, which must include, to the extent known, an identification of specific activities or behaviors that are precursors to the offender's offense cycle, including, but not limited to, activities or behaviors such as viewing or listening to pornography or use of alcohol or controlled substances.

c. The court on its own motion may order, or on a motion by the state shall order, a second examination regarding the offender's amenability to treatment. The examiner shall be selected by the party making the motion. The offender shall pay the cost of any second examination ordered unless the court finds the defendant to be indigent in which case the state shall pay the cost.
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>After receipt of the reports, the court shall consider whether the offender and the community will benefit from use of this alternative, consider whether the alternative is too lenient in light of the extent and circumstances of the offense, consider whether the offender has victims in addition to the victim of the offense, consider whether the offender is amenable to treatment, consider the risk the offender would present to the community, to the victim, or to persons of similar age and circumstances as the victim, and consider the victim's opinion whether the offender should receive a treatment disposition under this section. The court shall give great weight to the victim's opinion whether the offender should receive a treatment disposition under this section. If the sentence imposed is contrary to the victim's opinion, the court shall enter written findings stating its reasons for imposing the treatment disposition. The fact that the offender admits to his or her offense does not, by itself, constitute amenability to treatment. If the court determines that this alternative is appropriate, the court shall then impose a sentence or, pursuant to RCW 9.94A.507, a minimum term of sentence, within the standard sentence range. If the sentence imposed is less than eleven years of confinement, the court may suspend the execution of the sentence as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As conditions of the suspended sentence, the court must impose the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A term of confinement of up to twelve months or the maximum term within the standard range, whichever is less. The court may order the offender to serve a term of confinement greater than twelve months or the maximum term within the standard range based on the presence of an aggravating circumstance listed in RCW 9.94A.535(3). In no case shall the term of confinement exceed the statutory maximum sentence for the offense. The court may order the offender to serve all or part of his or her term of confinement in partial confinement. An offender sentenced to a term of confinement under this subsection is not eligible for earned release under RCW 9.92.151 or 9.94A.728.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A term of community custody equal to the length of the suspended sentence,  or three years, whichever is greater, and require the offender to comply with any conditions imposed by the department under RCW 9.94A.703. A supervision termination hearing shall be scheduled with the sentencing court within the last 60 days of the presumed expiration of community custody to determine if the individual should be released from community custody.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment for any period up to five years in duration. The court, in its discretion, shall order outpatient sex offender treatment or inpatient sex offender treatment, if available. A community mental health center may not be used for such treatment unless it has an appropriate program designed for sex offender treatment. The offender shall not change sex offender treatment providers or treatment conditions without first notifying the prosecutor, the community corrections officer, and the court. If any party or the court objects to a proposed change, the offender shall not change providers or conditions without court approval after a hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific prohibitions and affirmative conditions relating to the known precursor activities or behaviors identified in the proposed treatment plan under subsection (3)(b)(v) of this section or identified in an annual review under subsection (8)(b) of this section.</p>

<p>Require the offender to perform community restitution work; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require the offender to reimburse the victim for the cost of any counseling required as a result of the offender's crime.</p>

Prior to the treatment termination hearing, the treatment provider and community corrections officer shall submit written reports to the court and parties regarding the offender's compliance with treatment and monitoring requirements, and recommendations regarding termination from treatment, including proposed community custody conditions. The court may order an evaluation regarding the advisability of termination from treatment by a sex offender treatment provider who may not be the same person who treated the offender under subsection (5) of this section or any person who employs, is employed by, or shares profits with the person who treated the offender under subsection (5) of this section unless the court has entered written findings that such evaluation is in the best interest of the victim and that a successful evaluation of the offender would otherwise be impractical. The offender shall pay the cost of the evaluation.

<li>
<p>The court may revoke the suspended sentence at any time during the period of community custody and order execution of the sentence if: (a) The offender violates the conditions of the suspended sentence, or (b) the court finds that the offender is failing to make satisfactory progress in treatment. All confinement time served during the period of community custody shall be credited to the offender if the suspended sentence is revoked.</p>

<li>
<p>If the offender violates a requirement of the sentence that is not a condition of the suspended sentence pursuant to subsection (5) or (6) of this section, the department may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 9.94A.633(1).</p>

<li>
<p>The offender's sex offender treatment provider may not be the same person who examined the offender under subsection (3) of this section or any person who employs, is employed by, or shares profits with the person who examined the offender under subsection (3) of this section, unless the court has entered written findings that such treatment is in the best interests of the victim and that successful treatment of the offender would otherwise be impractical. Examinations and treatment ordered pursuant to this subsection shall only be conducted by certified sex offender treatment providers or certified affiliate sex offender treatment providers under chapter 18.155 RCW unless the court finds that:</p>
