<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that areas of Washington are at increasing risk in the frequency and severity of wildfires due to climate change. The legislature further finds that fighting wildfires with aerial firefighting can save lives, property, wildlife, habitat, and important cultural resources. In developing the new clean energy resources that Washington needs, the state must also ensure that communities are protected from the risk of wildfires. Therefore, the legislature is establishing an additional notice requirement to provide abundant opportunity for the department of natural resources to identify potential conflicts between the placement of energy facilities and aerial firefighting capabilities.</p>
