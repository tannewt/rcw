# HB 2301 - Waste material management

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2301.pdf)

## Section 101
1. The legislature finds:

    a. Washington is now experiencing the effects of a climate crisis: Hotter summers with record-breaking temperatures, devastating fires, drought conditions, and rising sea levels that erode our coastlines and are causing some communities to move upland;

    b. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and landfills are documented by the United States environmental protection agency to be the 3rd largest human-made source, with food, yard waste, and other plant-based organic material degrading in landfills to methane;

    c. Food waste is a major issue in the United States and globally, that, according to the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations, unwanted and discarded food squanders resources, including water, land, energy, labor, and capital, estimated that one-third of the food produced in the world for human consumption, about 1,300,000,000 tons, is lost or wasted every year, and the food loss and waste in industrialized countries equates to a value of approximately $680,000,000,000;

    d. The Harvard University food law and policy clinic has estimated that 40 percent of the food supply in the United States is not eaten and that according to the United States environmental protection agency and the United States department of agriculture, food loss and waste is the single largest component of disposed municipal solid waste in the United States;

    e. In 2015, that the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency and the secretary of the United States department of agriculture announced a national goal of reducing food waste by 50 percent by the year 2030. In 2019, Washington established the same goal in RCW 70A.205.715;

    f. Compost and other products of organic material management facilities have beneficial applications and can improve soil health, water quality, and other environmental outcomes. However, in order for the products of organic material management facilities to lead to improved environmental outcomes and for the economics of the operations of these facilities to pencil out, it is important that inbound sources of organic material waste are free of plastic contamination, pesticides, and other materials that will reduce compost quality; and

    g. Farmers, processors, retailers, and food banks in Washington are leaders in addressing this issue, and in 2022, with the enactment of chapter 180, Laws of 2022 (Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1799), Washington took significant steps towards the improvement of organic material management systems.

2. It is the legislature's intent to provide additional tools and financial resources to build on this progress in coming years by:

    a. Creating a variety of grant programs to support food waste reduction, food rescue, and other organic material management system improvements, including grants to support the implementation of new policy requirements related to organic material management;

    b. Amending solid waste management requirements in support of improved organic material management outcomes, including through the statewide standardization of colors and labels for organic, recycling, and garbage bins, and amending the organic material management service requirements in local jurisdictions and that apply to businesses;

    c. Standardizing and establishing a clear system of food expiration date labeling requirements;

    d. Prohibiting plastic product stickers and making changes to product degradability labeling requirements;

    e. Amending the state building code in support of organic material management; and

    f. Continuing to discuss how to maximize donations of food from generators of unwanted edible food.

## Section 201
1. The department, through the center, must develop and administer grant programs to support activities that reduce emissions from landfills and waste-to-energy facilities through the diversion of organic materials and food waste prevention, rescue, and recovery. Grant programs under this section must be developed and implemented in consultation with the department of agriculture, and the department must seek stakeholder input in the design, criteria, and logistics associated with each grant program. The department must allocate grant funding across the eligible categories specified in subsection (2) of this section in a manner consistent with legislative appropriations, and that achieves the following priorities:

    a. Maximizing greenhouse gas emission reductions;

    b. Eliminating barriers to the rescue and consumption of edible food that would otherwise be wasted;

    c. Developing stable funding programs for the department to administer and stable funding opportunities for potential fund recipients to be aware of; and

    d. Preferences the following management options, in order of most preferred to least preferred:

        i. Prevents wasted food;

        ii. Donates or upcycles food;

No more than 20 percent of funds allocated under this subsection (2)(c) may be awarded to a single grant recipient; and

    d. Food waste tracking and analytics pilot project grants. Local governments, tribes and tribal government entities, nonprofit organizations, transporters of unwanted edible food, and generators of unwanted edible food are eligible applicants for grants under this subsection. Eligible uses of grant funding under this subsection include staff time and technology to improve food waste prevention or improve tracking of food donations through the food supply chain and to provide data useful to enabling more efficient and effective outcomes for the provision of food available for rescue.

3. The department may establish additional eligibility criteria or application process requirements beyond those described in subsection (2) of this section for a category or categories of activity. The department may, as a condition of the award of a grant under this section, require the reporting of information to the department regarding the outcomes of the funded activities.

4. The department may award grants to eligible applicants meeting the minimum qualifying criteria on a competitive basis, or to applicants on a noncompetitive basis, or both. Within each category of activity described in subsection (2) of this section, the department must prioritize grant applications that benefit overburdened communities as defined in RCW 70A.02.010 as identified by the department in accordance with RCW 70A.02.050.

The grant reimbursements under the program begin July 1, 2023.

    b. For the purposes of this program, "farming operation" means: A commercial agricultural, silvicultural, or aquacultural facility or pursuit, including the care and production of livestock and livestock products, poultry and poultry products, apiary products, and plant and animal production for nonfood uses; the planting, cultivating, harvesting, and processing of crops; and the farming or ranching of any plant or animal species in a controlled salt, brackish, or freshwater environment.

2. To be eligible to participate in the reimbursement program, a farming operation must complete an eligibility review with the department prior to transporting or applying any compost products for which reimbursement is sought under this section. The purpose of the review is for the department to ensure that the proposed transport and application of compost products is consistent with the department's agricultural pest control rules established under chapter 17.24 RCW. A farming operation must also verify that it will allow soil sampling to be conducted by the department upon request before compost application and until at least 10 years after the last grant funding is used by the farming operation, as necessary to establish a baseline of soil quality and carbon storage and for subsequent department evaluations to assist the department's reporting requirements under subsection (8) of this section.

3. The department must create a form for eligible farming operations to apply for cost reimbursement for costs from purchasing and using compost containing vegetative waste feedstocks or food waste feedstocks, or both, including transportation, equipment, spreading, and labor costs. Compost must meet the applicable requirements for compost established by the department of ecology under chapter 70A.205 RCW. All applications for cost reimbursement must be submitted on the form along with invoices, receipts, or other documentation acceptable to the department of the costs of purchasing and using compost products for which the applicant is requesting reimbursement, as well as a brief description of what each purchased item will be used for.

    c. During eligibility review, each farming operation must provide an estimated incurred cost associated with the compost and other eligible purchases. The department must use the estimated incurred cost plus an additional 25 percent of the estimated incurred cost to account for additional unexpected costs that may arise in establishing a maximum grant request amount. The department may enter into a contractual agreement that provides grant funding in the amount of the lesser of:

        i. 50 percent of the maximum grant request amount calculated in this subsection (5)(c); or

        ii. $20,000;

    d. A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for its own compost products or compost products that it has transferred, or intends to transfer, to another individual or entity, whether or not for compensation; and

    e. A farming operation is not eligible to receive reimbursement for compost products that were not purchased from a facility with a solid waste handling permit or a permit-exempt facility that composts vegetative waste feed stocks, food waste feedstocks, or both.

6. The applicant shall indemnify and hold harmless the state and its officers, agents, and employees from all claims arising out of or resulting from the compost products purchased that are subject to the compost reimbursement program under this section.
