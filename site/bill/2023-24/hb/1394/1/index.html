<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that successful rehabilitation of youth adjudicated of sex offenses is the best path to reducing recidivism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that researchers from the Johns Hopkins University and other academic institutions found that treatment for minors convicted of sexual offenses would provide increased public safety, while registration and notification policies for minors convicted of sexual offenses failed to improve community safety. The legislature finds that requiring youth to register as sex offenders is associated with mental health struggles, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, as well as the increased likelihood of becoming a target of sexual abuse by adults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that while adults can petition for relief of registration for offenses committed as minors, the legal process is overly cumbersome, expensive, and challenging to the point that many never request removal and remain on the registry their entire lives. The legislature finds that Black, Hispanic, and American Indian individuals are overly represented in the population of registered juvenile sex offenders in Washington state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature declares that the response to sex offenses committed by youth should be developmentally appropriate and driven by research. The legislature therefore intends to increase community safety by reforming juvenile sex offender registration policy and related areas to redirect the focus toward practices that increase prevention and promote successful intervention strategies.</p>
