# HB 1611 - Local government permitting

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1611.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that delays in the permitting process can impose significant costs and time on the creation of new affordable housing. The legislature also finds that adopting deadlines for local governments to review and process permits will increase certainty and financing options for new projects and reduce the amount of time it takes for new housing units to be completed. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to reduce overall project cost, and to increase financing options, housing supply, and affordability by improving the certainty and speed of permitting review involving the development of housing.

## Section 2
Not later than March 31, 1996, each local government planning under RCW 36.70A.040 shall establish by ordinance or resolution an integrated and consolidated project permit process that may be included in its development regulations. No later than March 31, 2024, each local government planning under RCW 36.70A.040 with a population of 20,000 or more shall adopt or amend ordinances or resolutions to comply with the requirements of section 5 of this act. No later than March 31, 2025, each local government planning under RCW 36.70A.040 with a population of fewer than 20,000 shall adopt or amend ordinances or resolutions to comply with the requirements of section 5 of this act. In addition to the elements required by RCW 36.70B.050, the process shall include the following elements:

1. A determination of completeness to the applicant as required by RCW 36.70B.070 or section 5 of this act;

2. A notice of application to the public and agencies with jurisdiction as required by RCW 36.70B.110;

3. Except as provided in RCW 36.70B.140, an optional consolidated project permit review process as provided in RCW 36.70B.120. The review process shall provide for no more than one consolidated open record hearing and one closed record appeal. If an open record predecision hearing is provided prior to the decision on a project permit, the process shall not allow a subsequent open record appeal hearing;

4. Provision allowing for any public meeting or required open record hearing to be combined with any public meeting or open record hearing that may be held on the project by another local, state, regional, federal, or other agency, in accordance with provisions of RCW  36.70B.110;

5. A single report stating all the decisions made as of the date of the report on all project permits included in the consolidated permit process that do not require an open record predecision hearing and any recommendations on project permits that do not require an open record predecision hearing. The report shall state any mitigation required or proposed under the development regulations or the agency's authority under RCW 43.21C.060. The report may be the local permit. If a threshold determination other than a determination of significance has not been issued previously by the local government, the report shall include or append this determination;

6. Except for the appeal of a determination of significance as provided in RCW 43.21C.075, if a local government elects to provide an appeal of its threshold determinations or project permit decisions, the local government shall provide for no more than one consolidated open record hearing on such appeal. The local government need not provide for any further appeal and may provide an appeal for some but not all project permit decisions. If an appeal is provided after the open record hearing, it shall be a closed record appeal before a single decision-making body or officer;

7. A notice of decision as required by RCW 36.70B.130 and issued within the time period provided in RCW 36.70B.080 and section 5 of this act;

    b. That the application is incomplete and what is necessary to make the application complete.

To the extent known by the local government, the local government shall identify other agencies of local, state, or federal governments that may have jurisdiction over some aspect of the application.

2. A project permit application is complete for purposes of this section when it meets the procedural submission requirements of the local government and is sufficient for continued processing even though additional information may be required or project modifications may be undertaken subsequently. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the local government from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the notice of completeness or subsequently if new information is required or substantial changes in the proposed action occur.

3. The determination of completeness may include the following as optional information:

    a. A preliminary determination of those development regulations that will be used for project mitigation;

    b. A preliminary determination of consistency, as provided under RCW 36.70B.040; or

    b. Within fourteen days after an applicant has submitted to a local government additional information identified by the local government as being necessary for a complete application, the local government shall notify the applicant whether the application is complete or what additional information is necessary.

## Section 4
1. Development regulations adopted pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040 must establish and implement time periods for local government actions for each type of project permit application, except those for which time periods are specified in section 5 of this act, and provide timely and predictable procedures to determine whether a completed project permit application meets the requirements of those development regulations. Except as provided for in section 5 of this act, the time periods for local government actions for each type of complete project permit application or project type should not exceed 120 days, unless the local government makes written findings that a specified amount of additional time is needed to process specific complete project permit applications or project types.

The development regulations must, for each type of permit application, specify the contents of a completed project permit application necessary for the complete compliance with the time periods and procedures.

2. [Empty]

    a. Counties subject to the requirements of RCW 36.70A.215 and the cities within those counties that have populations of at least twenty thousand must, for each type of permit application, identify the total number of project permit applications for which decisions are issued according to the provisions of this chapter. For each type of project permit application identified, these counties and cities must establish and implement a deadline for issuing a notice of final decision as required by subsection (1) of this section and minimum requirements for applications to be deemed complete under RCW 36.70B.070 as required by subsection (1) of this section.

        i. Provide notice of and access to the annual performance reports through the county's or city's website; and

        ii. Post electronic facsimiles of the annual performance reports through the county's or city's website. Postings on a county's or city's website indicating that the reports are available by contacting the appropriate county or city department or official do not comply with the requirements of this subsection.

If a county or city subject to the requirements of this subsection does not maintain a website, notice of the reports must be given by reasonable methods, including but not limited to those methods specified in RCW 36.70B.110(4).
