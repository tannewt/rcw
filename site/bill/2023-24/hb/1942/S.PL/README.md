## Section 1
1. All existing rights and remedies available under state or local law for enforcement of the minimum wage shall be applicable to enforce all of the rights established under chapter 2, Laws of 2017.

2. (a) If the department of social and health services contracts with an individual provider for personal care services or respite care services, the state shall pay individual providers, as defined in RCW 74.39A.240, in accordance with the minimum wage, overtime, and paid sick leave requirements of this chapter, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section.

    b. A consumer directed employer contracting with the state is an employer of individual providers for the purposes of this chapter. Individual providers are employees of the consumer directed employer.

    c. Neither the department of social and health services nor the consumer directed employer may avail itself of any state law minimum wage or overtime exemption, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section.

3. The definitions in this subsection apply to this section:

    a. "Authorized hours" means the number of paid hours of care included in the client's plan of care as determined by the department of social and health services.

    b. "Client" has the same meaning as in RCW 74.39A.009.

    c. "Consumer directed employer" has the same meaning as in RCW 74.39A.009.

    d. "Family member" includes, but is not limited to, a parent, child, sibling, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, cousin, grandparent, grandchild, grandniece, grandnephew, or such relatives when related by marriage, adoption, or domestic partnership.

    e. "Household member" means an individual provider who lives with the client and did so before the employment relationship between the client and individual provider began.

    f. "Individual provider" has the same meaning as in RCW 74.39A.240.

    a. Hours worked by an individual provider in excess of the number of authorized hours in the client's plan of care are not compensable if:

        i. The individual provider is a family member or household member of the client, as defined by this section; and

        ii. The client's plan of care is reasonable.

    b. This subsection (4) does not apply to hours worked to address temporary emergencies or an unexpected health or safety event of the client that cannot be postponed.

    c. A client's plan of care is reasonable under (a)(ii) of this subsection if all of the following are true:

        i. The plan of care includes the same number of paid hours it would have if the individual provider were not a family member or household member of the client;

        ii. The plan of care does not reflect unequal treatment of an individual provider or their client because of their familial or household relationship. Unequal treatment includes the plan of care including fewer paid hours than it would have if the client's individual provider were not a family or household member of the client; the plan of care including fewer paid hours because the client's individual provider shares in the benefit of a personal care service or task provided to the client; the plan of care including fewer paid hours because the client lives in a multiclient household and two or more clients benefit from the same personal care service or task being performed; or the plan of care including fewer paid hours because of paid or unpaid assistance provided to a client by that client's paid provider; and

        iii. The department of social and health services does not otherwise require an increase in the hours of unpaid services performed by the family or household member individual provider in order to reduce the number of hours of paid services.

    d. A determination that a plan of care is reasonable for purposes of this section does not mean that the amount or type of services or paid hours to be provided are or are not appropriate for the client under chapter 74.39A RCW.

5. The department of social and health services retains its core responsibility to manage long-term in-home care services under chapters 74.39A and 74.41 RCW and its authority to set a client's benefit level as required by RCW 74.09.520(3). However, to limit an individual provider's compensable hours as described in subsection (4)(a) of this section, a plan of care must satisfy the requirements of subsection (4)(a) and (c) of this section.

6. The director of labor and industries may adopt rules to implement this section.

    a. The consumer directed employer program is a consumer directed program and must be operated in a manner consistent with federal medicaid requirements. The consumer directed employer is the legal employer of individual providers .

    b. Under the consumer directed employer program, the consumer is the managing employer of individual providers and retains the primary right to select, dismiss, assign hours, and supervise the work of one or more individual providers, as long as the consumer's actions are consistent with the consumer's plan of care, this chapter, and state and federal law.

2. The department shall endeavor to select and contract with one consumer directed employer to be a medicaid provider that will coemploy individual providers. The department shall make every effort to select a single qualified vendor. In the event it is not possible to contract with a single vendor, the department is authorized to contract with up to two vendors. The department's activities to identify, select, and contract with a consumer directed employer are exempt from the requirements of chapter 39.26 RCW.

    a. When contracting with a consumer directed employer, the department should seek to contract with a vendor that demonstrates:

        i. A strong commitment to consumer choice, self-direction, and maximizing consumer autonomy and control over daily decisions; and

        ii. A commitment to recruiting and retaining a high quality and diverse workforce and working with a broad coalition of stakeholders in an effort to understand the changing needs of the workforce and consumer needs and preferences.

    b. Additional factors the department should consider in selecting a vendor include, but are not limited to, the vendor's:

        i. Ability to provide maximum support to consumers to focus on directing their own services through a model that recognizes that the provision of employer responsibility and human resource administration support is integral to successful self-directed home care programs;

    d. Any qualified and willing individual may apply to become an employee of a consumer directed employer and may work as an individual provider when selected by a consumer.

    h.

3. If the department selects and contracts with a consumer directed employer, the department shall determine when to terminate the department's contracts with individual providers.

    a. Until the department determines the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, the state shall continue to administer the individual provider program for the remaining contracted individual providers and to act as the public employer solely for the purpose of collective bargaining under RCW 74.39A.270 for those directly contracted individual providers.

    b. Once the department determines that the transition to the consumer directed employer is complete, the department may no longer contract with individual providers, unless there are not any contracted consumer directed employers available.

4. The department of labor and industries shall initially place individual providers employed by a consumer directed employer in the classification for the home care services and home care referral registry. After the department determines that the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, the department of labor and industries may, if necessary, adjust the classification and rate in accordance with chapter 51.16 RCW.

5. After the date on which the department enters into a contract with the consumer directed employer and determines the transition to the consumer directed employer program is complete, biennial funding in the next ensuing biennium for case management and social work shall be reduced by no more than: Two million nine hundred eight thousand dollars for area agencies on aging; one million three hundred sixty-one thousand dollars for home and community services; and one million two hundred eighty-nine thousand dollars for developmental disabilities.
