<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the state's gas and electrical companies face transformational change brought on by new technology, emerging opportunities for customers, and state clean energy laws. Chapter 19.405 RCW, the Washington clean energy transformation act, and chapter 70A.65 RCW, the Washington climate commitment act, require these companies to find innovative and creative solutions to equitably serve their customers, provide clean energy, reduce emissions, and keep rates fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gas companies that serve over 500,000 gas customers in Washington state, which are also electrical companies, or large combination utilities, play an important role in providing affordable and reliable heating and other energy services, and in leading the implementation of state climate policies. As the state transitions to cleaner sources of energy, large combination utilities are an important partner in helping their customers make smart energy choices, including actively supporting the replacement of fossil fuel-based space and water heating equipment and other fossil fuel-based equipment with high-efficiency nonemitting equipment. Programs to accelerate the adoption of efficient, nonemitting appliances have the potential to allow large combination utilities to optimize the use of energy infrastructure, improve the management of energy loads, better manage the integration of variable renewable energy resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector, mitigate the environmental impacts of utility operations and power purchases, and improve health outcomes for occupants. Legislative clarity is important for utilities to offer programs and services, including incentives, in the decarbonization of homes and buildings for their customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas limits in the energy sectors of the economy, more resources must be directed toward achieving decarbonization of residential and commercial heating loads and other loads that are served with fossil fuels, while continuing to protect all customers, but especially low-income customers, vulnerable populations, highly impacted communities, and overburdened communities. The legislature finds that regulatory innovation may be needed to remove barriers that large combination utilities may face to meet the state's public policy objectives and expectations. The enactment of chapter 188, Laws of 2021 (Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5295) began that regulatory transition from traditional cost-of-service regulation, with investor-owned gas and electrical companies using forward-looking multiyear rate plans and taking steps toward performance-based regulation. These steps are intended to provide certainty and stability to both customers and to investor-owned gas and electrical companies, aligning public policy objectives with investments, safety, and reliability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that as Washington transitions to 100 percent clean electricity and as the state implements the Washington climate commitment act, switching from fossil fuel-based heating equipment and other fossil fuel-based appliances to high-efficiency nonemitting equipment will reduce climate impacts and fuel price risks for customers in the long term. This new paradigm requires a thoughtful transition to decarbonize the energy system to ensure that all customers benefit from the transition, that customers are protected, are not subject to sudden price shocks, and continue to receive needed energy services, with an equitable allocation of benefits and burdens. This transition will require careful and integrated planning by and between utilities, the commission, and customers, as well as new regulatory tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to require large combination utilities to decarbonize their systems by: (a) Prioritizing efficient and cost-effective measures to transition customers off of the direct use of fossil fuels at the lowest reasonable cost to customers; (b) investing in the energy supply, storage, delivery, and demand-side resources that will be needed to serve any increase in electrical demand affordably and reliably; (c) maintaining safety and reliability as the gas system undergoes transformational changes; (d) integrating zero-carbon and carbon-neutral fuels to serve high heat and industrial loads where electrification may not be technically feasible; (e) managing peak demand of the electric system; and (f) ensuring an equitable distribution of benefits to, and reduction of burdens for, vulnerable populations, highly impacted communities, and overburdened communities that have historically been underserved by utility energy efficiency programs, and may be disproportionately impacted by rising fuel and equipment costs or experience high energy burden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to support this transition by adopting requirements for large combination utilities to conduct integrated system planning to develop specific actions supporting gas system decarbonization and electrification, and reduction in the gas rate base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to encourage a robust competitive wholesale market for generation, storage, and demand-side resources to serve the state's electrical companies, other electric utilities, and end-users that secure their own power supply.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that large combination utilities are subject to a range of reporting and planning requirements as part of the clean energy transition. The legislature further finds that current natural gas integrated resource plans under development might not yield optimal results for timely and cost-effective decarbonization. To reduce regulatory barriers, achieve equitable and transparent outcomes, and integrate planning requirements, the commission may consolidate a large combination utility's planning requirements for both gas and electric operations, including consolidation into a single integrated system plan that is approved by the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2025, the commission shall complete a rule-making proceeding to implement consolidated planning requirements for gas and electric services for large combination utilities that may include plans required under: (i) RCW 19.280.030; (ii) RCW 19.285.040; (iii) RCW 19.405.060; (iv) RCW 80.28.380; (v) RCW 80.28.365; (vi) RCW 80.28.425; and (vii) RCW 80.28.130. The commission may extend the rule-making proceeding for 90 days for good cause shown. The large combination utilities' filing deadline required in subsection (4) of this section will be extended commensurate to the rule-making extension period set by the commission. Subsequent planning requirements for future integrated system plans must be fulfilled on a timeline set by the commission. Large combination utilities that file integrated system plans are no longer required to file separate plans that are required in an integrated system plan. The statutorily required contents of any plan consolidated into an integrated system plan must be met by the integrated system plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In its order adopting rules or issuing a policy statement approving the consolidation of planning requirements, the commission shall include a compliance checklist and any additional guidance that is necessary to assist the large combination utility in meeting the minimum requirements of all relevant statutes and rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon request by a large combination utility, the commission may issue an order extending the filing and reporting requirements of a large combination utility under RCW 19.405.060 and 19.280.030, and requiring the large combination utility to file an integrated system plan pursuant to subsection (4) of this section if the commission finds that the large combination utility has made public a work plan that demonstrates reasonable progress toward meeting the standards under RCW 19.405.040(1) and 19.405.050(1) and achieving equity goals. The commission's approval of an extension of filing and reporting requirements does not relieve the large combination utility from the obligation to demonstrate progress towards meeting the standards under RCW 19.405.040(1) and 19.405.050(1) and the interim targets approved in its most recent clean energy implementation plan. Commission approval of an extension under this section fulfills the large combination utilities statutory filing deadlines under RCW 19.405.060(1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2027, and on a timeline set by the commission thereafter, large combination utilities shall file an integrated system plan demonstrating how the large combination utilities' plans are consistent with the requirements of this chapter and any rules and guidance adopted by the commission, and which:</p>

<p>An electric utility regulated by the utilities and transportation commission under this chapter may submit to the commission an electrification of transportation plan that deploys electric vehicle supply equipment or provides other electric transportation programs, services, or incentives to support electrification of transportation. The plans should align to a period consistent with either the utility's planning horizon under its most recent integrated resource plan or the time frame of the actions contemplated in the plan, and may include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any programs that the utility is proposing contemporaneously with the plan filing or anticipates later in the plan period;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anticipated benefits of transportation electrification, based on a forecast of electric transportation in the utilities' service territory; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anticipated costs of programs, subject to the restrictions in RCW 80.28.360.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In reviewing an electrification of transportation plan under subsection (1) of this section, the commission may consider the following: (a) The applicability of multiple options for electrification of transportation across all customer classes; (b) the impact of electrification on the utility's load, and whether demand response or other load management opportunities, including direct load control and dynamic pricing, are operationally appropriate; (c) system reliability and distribution system efficiencies; (d) interoperability concerns, including the interoperability of hardware and software systems in electrification of transportation proposals; and (e) the benefits and costs of the planned actions.</p>

<p>Beginning January 1, 2022, every general rate case filing of a gas or electrical company must include a proposal for a multiyear rate plan as provided in this chapter. The commission may, by order after an adjudicative proceeding as provided by chapter 34.05 RCW, approve, approve with conditions, or reject, a multiyear rate plan proposal made by a gas or electrical company or an alternative proposal made by one or more parties, or any combination thereof. The commission's consideration of a proposal for a multiyear rate plan is subject to the same standards applicable to other rate filings made under this title, including the public interest and fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient rates. In determining the public interest, the commission may consider such factors including, but not limited to, environmental health and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, health and safety concerns, economic development, and equity, to the extent such factors affect the rates, services, and practices of a gas or electrical company regulated by the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications any proposal to recover from ratepayers up to five percent of the total revenue requirement approved by the commission for each year of a multiyear rate plan for tariffs that reduce the energy burden of low-income residential customers including, but not limited to: (a) Bill assistance programs; or (b) one or more special rates. For any multiyear rate plan approved under this section resulting in a rate increase, the commission must approve an increase in the amount of low-income bill assistance to take effect in each year of the rate plan where there is a rate increase. At a minimum, the amount of such low-income assistance increase must be equal to double the percentage increase, if any, in the residential base rates approved for each year of the rate plan. The commission may approve a larger increase to low-income bill assistance based on an appropriate record.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If it approves a multiyear rate plan, the commission shall separately approve rates for each of the initial rate year, the second rate year and, if applicable, the third rate year, and the fourth rate year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property of any gas or electrical company that is or will be used and useful under RCW 80.04.250 for service in this state by or during each rate year of the multiyear rate plan. For the initial rate year, the commission shall, at a minimum, ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property of any gas or electrical company that is used and useful for service in this state as of the rate effective date. The commission may order refunds to customers if property expected to be used and useful by the rate effective date when the commission approves a multiyear rate plan is in fact not used and useful by such a date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall ascertain and determine the revenues and operating expenses for rate-making purposes of any gas or electrical company for each rate year of the multiyear rate plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In ascertaining and determining the fair value of property of a gas or electrical company pursuant to (b) of this subsection and projecting the revenues and operating expenses of a gas or electrical company pursuant to (c) of this subsection, the commission may use any standard, formula, method, or theory of valuation reasonably calculated to arrive at fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commission approves a multiyear rate plan with a duration of three or four years, then the electrical company must update its power costs as of the rate effective date of the third rate year. The proceeding to update the electrical company's power costs is subject to the same standards that apply to other rate filings made under this title.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to subsection (5) of this section, the commission may by order establish terms, conditions, and procedures for a multiyear rate plan and ensure that rates remain fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient during the course of the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, a gas or electrical company is bound by the terms of the multiyear rate plan approved by the commission for each of the initial rate year and the second rate year. A gas or electrical company may file a new multiyear rate plan in accordance with this section for the third rate year and fourth rate year, if any, of a multiyear rate plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the annual commission basis report for a gas or electrical company demonstrates that the reported rate of return on rate base of the company for the 12-month period ending as of the end of the period for which the annual commission basis report is filed is more than .5 percent higher than the rate of return authorized by the commission in the multiyear rate plan for such a company, the company shall defer all revenues that are in excess of .5 percent higher than the rate of return authorized by the commission for refunds to customers or another determination by the commission in a subsequent adjudicative proceeding. If a multistate electrical company with fewer than 250,000 customers in Washington files a multiyear rate plan that provides for no increases in base rates in consecutive years beyond the initial rate year, the commission shall waive the requirements of this subsection provided that such a waiver results in just and reasonable rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must, in approving a multiyear rate plan, determine a set of performance measures that will be used to assess a gas or electrical company operating under a multiyear rate plan. These performance measures may be based on proposals made by the gas or electrical company in its initial application, by any other party to the proceeding in its response to the company's filing, or in the testimony and evidence admitted in the proceeding. In developing performance measures, incentives, and penalty mechanisms, the commission may consider factors including, but not limited to, lowest reasonable cost planning, affordability, increases in energy burden, cost of service, customer satisfaction and engagement, service reliability, clean energy or renewable procurement, conservation acquisition, demand side management expansion, rate stability, timely execution of competitive procurement practices, attainment of state energy and emissions reduction policies, rapid integration of renewable energy resources, and fair compensation of utility employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes any gas or electrical company from making filings required or permitted by the commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall align, to the extent practical, the timing of approval of a multiyear rate plan of an electrical company submitted pursuant to this section with the clean energy implementation plan of the electrical company filed pursuant to RCW 19.405.060.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this section may not be construed to limit the existing rate-making authority of the commission.</p>
