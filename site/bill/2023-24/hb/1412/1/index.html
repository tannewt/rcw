<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that agricultural land is a critical and limited resource and that foreign ownership of agricultural land threatens the state's and nation's interests, independence, and food security. The legislature, therefore, intends to prohibit future sales of agricultural land in this state to foreign governments and entities.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any alien who is a natural person may acquire and hold lands, or any right thereto, or interest therein, by purchase, devise, or descent; and he or she may convey, mortgage, and devise the same, and if he or she shall die intestate, the same shall descend to his or her heirs, and in all cases such lands shall be held, conveyed, mortgaged, or devised, or shall descend in like manner and with like effect as if such alien were a native citizen of this state or of the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>On or after August 1, 2023, no foreign government, foreign state-controlled enterprise, foreign business entity, or foreign-controlled domestic business entity may purchase, acquire, lease, or hold any interest in agricultural land in Washington, or be the beneficiary of any trust that owns or controls agricultural land in Washington, unless expressly authorized by a treaty between the United States and another country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This restriction does not apply to any interest in agricultural land in Washington held by a foreign government, foreign state-controlled enterprise, foreign business entity, or foreign-controlled domestic business entity that was acquired before August 1, 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer of an interest in agricultural land in violation of this section is void.</p>

<li>
<p>Beginning on January 1, 2024, the department shall review all agricultural land sales in this state prior to the closing of the transaction, and no purchase or sale of agricultural land in this state is valid unless reviewed and approved by the department.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall not approve any purchase or sale of agricultural land in this state unless it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the buyer is not prohibited from buying agricultural land pursuant to this section. The buyer of the agricultural land has the burden of proving it is not prohibited from purchasing agricultural land pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department denies approval of the purchase or sale of agricultural land pursuant to this section, the buyer may bring an action in superior court seeking review of the department's decision within one year of the department denying approval.
