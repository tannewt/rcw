## Section 1
1. For the benefit of ratepayers, allowances must be allocated at no cost to covered entities that are natural gas utilities.

    a. [Empty]

        i. By October 1, 2022, the department shall adopt rules, in consultation with the utilities and transportation commission, establishing the methods and procedures for allocating allowances to natural gas utilities. Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, rules adopted under this subsection must allow for a natural gas utility to be provided allowances at no cost to cover their emissions and decline proportionally with the cap, consistent with RCW 70A.65.070. Allowances allocated at no cost to natural gas utilities must be consigned to auction for the benefit of ratepayers consistent with subsection (2) of this section, deposited for compliance, or a combination of both. The rules adopted by the department pursuant to this section must include provisions directing revenues generated under this subsection to the applicable utilities.

        ii. For municipal gas utilities subject to the provisions of chapter 35.92 RCW, the department shall adopt rules, beginning in 2025, that include an annual decline in the provision of allowances at no cost by two percent each year relative to the utility's allocation baseline.

    b. [Empty]

        i. By October 1, 2022, the department shall adopt an allocation schedule by rule, in consultation with the utilities and transportation commission, for the first two compliance periods for the provision of allowances for the benefit of ratepayers at no cost to natural gas utilities.

        ii. By October 1, 2024, the department shall adopt an updated allocation schedule to implement the provisions of (a)(ii) of this subsection and subsection (2)(a)(ii) of this section.

    c. By October 1, 2028, the department shall adopt an allocation schedule by rule, in consultation with the utilities and transportation commission, for the provision of allowances for the benefit of ratepayers at no cost to natural gas utilities for the compliance periods contained within calendar years 2031 through 2040.

2. [Empty]

    a. (i) Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, beginning in 2023, 65 percent of the no cost allowances must be consigned to auction for the benefit of customers, including at a minimum eliminating any additional cost burden to low-income customers from the implementation of this chapter. Rules adopted under this subsection must increase the percentage of allowances consigned to auction by five percent each year until a total of 100 percent is reached.

        ii. For allowances allocated to municipal gas utilities subject to the provisions of chapter 35.92 RCW, rules adopted under this subsection must increase the percentage of allowances consigned to auction by two percent each year, beginning in 2025, until a total of 100 percent is reached.

    b. Revenues from allowances sold at auction must be returned by providing nonvolumetric credits on ratepayer utility bills, prioritizing low-income customers, or used to minimize cost impacts on low-income, residential, and small business customers through actions that include, but are not limited to, weatherization, decarbonization, conservation and efficiency services, and bill assistance. The customer benefits provided from allowances consigned to auction under this section must be in addition to existing requirements in statute, rule, or other legal requirements.

    c. Except for low-income customers, the customer bill credits under this subsection are reserved exclusively for customers at locations connected to a natural gas utility's system on July 25, 2021. Bill credits may not be provided to customers of the gas utility at a location connected to the system after July 25, 2021.

3. In order to qualify for no cost allowances, covered entities that are natural gas utilities must provide copies of their greenhouse gas emissions reports filed with the United States environmental protection agency under 40 C.F.R. Part 98 subpart NN - suppliers of natural gas and natural gas liquids for calendar years 2015 through 2021 to the department on or before March 31, 2022. The copies of the reports must be provided in electronic form to the department, in a manner prescribed by the department. The reports must be complete and contain all information required by 40 C.F.R. Sec. 98.406 including, but not limited to, information on large end users served by the natural gas utility. For any year where a natural gas utility was not required to file this report with the United States environmental protection agency, a report may be submitted in a manner prescribed by the department containing all of the information required in the subpart NN report.

4. To continue receiving no cost allowances, a natural gas utility must provide to the department the United States environmental protection agency subpart NN greenhouse gas emissions report for each reporting year in the manner and by the dates provided by RCW 70A.15.2200(5) as part of the greenhouse gas reporting requirements of this chapter.
