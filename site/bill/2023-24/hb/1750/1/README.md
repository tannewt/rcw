# HB 1750 - Water safety education

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1750.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that drowning is the leading cause of death for children aged one to four, and for every death, there are five to 10 nonfatal cases requiring hospital care. Babies under one year of age are more likely to drown at home, and 23 percent of child drownings occur during a family gathering near a pool.

The legislature finds that most of these deaths are completely preventable through education around water safety and drowning prevention and increasing equitable access to swimming lessons and water safety tools and equipment. The victims of childhood drowning are disproportionately from communities of color. Forty-five percent of Hispanic children and 64 percent of African American children have limited or no ability to swim, compared to 40 percent of Caucasian children. African American children ages five through 19 are specifically five and one-half times more likely to drown in a swimming pool compared to their Caucasian counterparts. In addition, male children are twice as likely to drown. Socioeconomic factors also have an impact on disproportionate outcomes. Children whose parents are unable to swim often lack the skill as well, and 79 percent of children in households with an income under $50,000 have limited or no ability to swim.

The legislature emphasizes the importance of educating children, parents, and other caregivers about the basics of swimming, floating, signs of drowning, and how to help drowning victims, as well as bringing awareness to critical layers of protection such as barriers and water safety tools and equipment. Drowning happens quickly and quietly, making it important to watch children closely, raise awareness, and emphasize education around water safety.

## Section 2
1. The following are state legal holidays:

    a. Sunday;

    b. The first day of January, commonly called New Year's Day;

    d. The third Monday of February, to be known as Presidents' Day and celebrated as the anniversary of the births of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington;

    e. The last Monday of May, commonly known as Memorial Day;

    f. The nineteenth day of June, recognized as Juneteenth, a day of remembrance for the day the African slaves learned of their freedom;

2. Employees of the state and its political subdivisions, except employees of school districts and except those nonclassified employees of institutions of higher education who hold appointments or are employed under contracts to perform services for periods of less than twelve consecutive months, are entitled to one paid holiday per calendar year in addition to those specified in this section. Each employee of the state or its political subdivisions may select the day on which the employee desires to take the additional holiday provided for in this section after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority.

3. Employees of the state and its political subdivisions, including employees of school districts and those nonclassified employees of institutions of higher education who hold appointments or are employed under contracts to perform services for periods of less than twelve consecutive months, are entitled to two unpaid holidays per calendar year for a reason of faith or conscience or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization. This includes employees of public institutions of higher education, including community colleges, technical colleges, and workforce training programs. The employee may select the days on which the employee desires to take the two unpaid holidays after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority. If an employee prefers to take the two unpaid holidays on specific days for a reason of faith or conscience, or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization, the employer must allow the employee to do so unless the employee's absence would impose an undue hardship on the employer or the employee is necessary to maintain public safety. Undue hardship shall have the meaning established in rule by the office of financial management under RCW 43.41.109.

4. If any of the state legal holidays specified in this section are also federal legal holidays but observed on different dates, only the state legal holidays are recognized as a paid legal holiday for employees of the state and its political subdivisions. However, for port districts and the law enforcement and public transit employees of municipal corporations, either the federal or the state legal holiday is recognized as a paid legal holiday, but in no case may both holidays be recognized as a paid legal holiday for employees.

5. Whenever any state legal holiday:

    a. Other than Sunday, falls upon a Sunday, the following Monday is the legal holiday; or

    b. Falls upon a Saturday, the preceding Friday is the legal holiday.

6. Nothing in this section may be construed to have the effect of adding or deleting the number of paid holidays provided for in an agreement between employees and employers of political subdivisions of the state or as established by ordinance or resolution of the local government legislative authority.
