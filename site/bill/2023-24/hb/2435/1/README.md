[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2435.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds the People's Republic of China has an interest in gathering information about Washington residents, Washington companies, and the intellectual property of users to engage in corporate and international espionage.

The legislature further finds TikTok is a wholly owned subsidiary of ByteDance, a Chinese corporation.

The legislature further finds the People's Republic of China exercises control and oversight over ByteDance, like other Chinese corporations, and can direct the company to share user information, including real-time physical locations of users.

The legislature further finds TikTok gathers significant information from its users, accessing data against their will to share with the People's Republic of China.

The legislature further finds TikTok fails to remove, and may even promote, dangerous content that directs minors to engage in dangerous activities including, but not limited to, throwing objects at moving automobiles, taking excessive amounts of medication, lighting a mirror on fire and then attempting to extinguish it using only one's body parts, inducing unconsciousness through oxygen deprivation, cooking chicken in NyQuil, pouring hot wax on a user's face, attempting to break an unsuspecting passerby's skull by tripping him or her into landing face first into a hard surface, placing metal objects in electrical outlets, swerving cars at high rates of speed, smearing human feces on toddlers, licking doorknobs and toilet seats to place oneself at risk of contracting coronavirus, attempting to climb stacks of milk crates, shooting passersby with air rifles, loosening lug nuts on vehicles, and stealing utilities from public places.

The legislature further finds TikTok's stealing of information and data from users and its ability to share that data with the Chinese Communist Party unacceptably infringes on Washington residents' right to privacy.
