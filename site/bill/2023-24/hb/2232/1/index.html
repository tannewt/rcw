<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The state of Washington finds and declares that in the midst of an energy transition away from reliance on fossil fuels, but until that transition is complete, the petroleum-based transportation fuels are of critical importance to the people and businesses of the state. The legislature further finds and declares that the Washington state government requires: At all times a complete and thorough understanding of the operation of petroleum markets, to enable it to respond to possible shortages, price shocks, oversupplies, or other disruptions; and access to timely reporting, assessment, and data collection activities to serve information and policy development needs of the governor, the legislature, public agencies, market participants, and the public.</p>
<p>Washington consumers, state and local agencies, businesses, and policymakers, planners, and enforcement agencies lack access to sufficient pricing and operational information held by refinery operators, fuel suppliers, and others in the supply chain for transportation fuels. Such pricing and operational information for transportation fuels is critical to understanding the cost basis for prices, identifying improper pricing or supply control behaviors in the market, and protecting Washington state consumers, government entities, and businesses. Similar information is already available for other critical fuels, such as electricity.</p>
<p>To protect consumers, Washington state must collect detailed pricing and operational information from refineries, fuel suppliers, and others in the petroleum products supply chain, analyze the data, and provide summarized reports to the public and lawmakers to expose relevant cost and pricing practices in the industry, and to identify market design flaws, market power abuses, and any other manner by which market participants act to harm competition or act contrary to the best interests of consumers in the state.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to ensure that the market for petroleum products is free of anticompetitive and predatory conduct, the legislature finds that additional legal consequences are needed to ensure that petroleum industry prices and practices do not harm consumers.</p>

<p>On or before July 1, 2026, and every three years thereafter, the commission shall submit an assessment to the legislature, and to the governor that does all of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Identifies methods to ensure a reliable supply of affordable and safe transportation fuels in Washington. The assessment shall consider the potential benefits to Washington transportation fuel consumers of creating estimates for the level of transportation fuels at the state level and, to the extent feasible, at regional and local levels, and individual refineries if relevant, that should be held in reserve by refiners to prevent shortages that result in sharp increases in the price of transportation fuels. The assessment must consider all factors causing price fluctuation in retail transportation fuels prices when recommending adequate reserve levels. The commission shall consider all relevant evidence from any reasonably available source including, but not limited to, information about imports, by amount, source, if known, and data received by the commission pursuant to existing laws, economic and business experts, and information from any local, state, and federal agencies. The commission shall transmit to the legislature any proposals it deems appropriate for mandatory reserve levels and the terms of a program to implement reserve levels;</p>

<li>
<p>Evaluates the price of transportation fuels, including branded and unbranded retail prices, alternate formulations of transportation fuels with lower carbon impact, and other products suitable for production from refineries in Washington. This evaluation must consider the market demand for these products at three, seven, 10, and 20-year intervals from the date of the assessment. This evaluation must include both of the following:</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>(A) An examination of whether branded fuel additives have any impact and, if so, how much on fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions; and</p>

<pre><code>    iii. Considers different levels of supply conditions and assesses the impact of potential refinery closures in Washington;

    iv. Includes an analysis of the impacts on production of refinery planned maintenance, unplanned maintenance, and turnaround, utilizing the quarterly reports provided by refineries as directed in section 6(12) of this act. The commission and division, in consultation with the department of labor and industries and labor and industry stakeholders, shall consider ways to manage necessary refinery turnarounds and maintenance that would protect the health and safety of employees and the public, and minimize the impact of maintenance-related production losses on fuel prices. Notwithstanding any other law, the department of labor and industries shall disclose to the commission, upon request, any information the department has received to ensure all aspects of refinery safety are incorporated into the analysis. All information designated confidential must be treated as confidential by the commission;

v. Evaluates the utility and feasibility of alternative methods to maintain adequate supplies of transportation fuels, including delivery alternatives for fuel and components of fuel, such as delivery by rail, a publicly maintained strategic fuel reserve, and other solutions beyond the activities of refineries and petroleum market participants; and

vi. Proposes solutions to mitigate any impacts described in the assessment. The solutions must include an assessment of the employment impacts and the cost and cost-effectiveness of any proposal, including cost impacts to all impacted sectors, both public and private. The assessment must include recommendations and alternatives.

b. The first assessment must include the evaluation of transportation fuels refining.
