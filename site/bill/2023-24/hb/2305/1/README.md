# HB 2305 - Tribal warrants

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2305.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that the 29 federally recognized Indian tribes with territory inside the state of Washington have a shared interest with the state in public safety, and that continued and expanded cooperation with tribal justice systems will promote that interest. The legislature also recognizes that tribes have, for decades, agreed by treaty and through practice not to shelter or conceal those individuals who violate state law and to surrender them to the state for prosecution. In the interests of public safety and partnership, it is therefore the intent of the legislature to create uniform processes by which the state may consistently reciprocate with tribes the return of those individuals who violate tribal law and seek to avoid tribal justice systems by leaving tribal jurisdiction.

The legislature also recognizes the inherent authority of the judiciary under Article IV, section 1 of the state Constitution to establish rules regarding the jurisdiction of and communication between state and tribal courts as evidenced by superior court civil rule 82.5. The tribal state court consortium exists within the Washington state administrative office of the courts as a joint effort between the state and tribal court officers and other judicial branch members for the purpose of expanding communication and collaboration. The consortium provides an open, transparent forum where state and tribal court judicial officers may convene regarding issues of jurisdiction and service gaps, and to develop partnerships. With an emphasis on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault, the consortium's initiatives expressly include addressing issues of full faith and credit in these contexts.

The legislature further recognizes it is a constitutional imperative that individuals alleged to have violated criminal laws are afforded the fullest protections of due process including, but not limited to: (1) The right to effective assistance of counsel at least equal to that guaranteed by the United States Constitution; (2) the right of an indigent defendant to the assistance of a licensed defense attorney, at the expense of the tribal government; (3) the right to a criminal proceeding presided over by a judge who is licensed to practice law and has sufficient legal training; (4) the right to have access, prior to being charged, to the tribe's criminal laws, rules of evidence, and rules of criminal procedure; and (5) the right to a record of the criminal proceeding, including an audio or other recording of the trial proceeding. The legislature finds that numerous federally recognized tribes with territory inside the state have systems and processes recognized by the federal government as providing due process to defendants at least equal to those required by the United States Constitution. The legislature also finds that all defendants in tribal courts have the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

The legislature additionally recognizes the importance of establishing clear statutory duties when directing peace officers of this state to effectuate new aspects of their work. It is the intent of the legislature that this act set forth procedures by which peace officers and correctional staff of this state must recognize and effectuate tribal arrest warrants.

Therefore, the legislature declares the purpose of this act is to expand cross jurisdictional cooperation so that fugitives from tribal courts cannot evade justice by remaining off reservation in Washington's counties and cities, while ensuring that defendants receive the fullest due process protections.

## Section 8
1. A noncertified tribe that requests extradition pursuant to this act is responsible to arrange the transportation for the tribal fugitive from the place of detention to the tribal court or detention facility. The detention facility and noncertified tribe are encouraged to select the means of transport that best protects public safety after considering available resources. At the request of a noncertified tribe, a city, county, or the governor must engage in good faith efforts to negotiate an agreement to effectuate this subsection.

2. A tribal court representative may transport a tribal fugitive within the state of Washington pursuant to an order of surrender.

## Section 9

3. After being informed by the judge of the effect of a waiver, the arrested person may waive the right to require a judicial hearing and consent to return to the applicable noncertified tribe by executing a written waiver.

4. If a hearing is not waived under subsection (3) of this section, the court shall hold a hearing within three days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the initial appearance. The arrested person and the prosecuting attorney's office shall be informed of the time and place of the hearing. The court shall release the person upon conditions that will reasonably assure availability of the person for the hearing or direct a peace officer to maintain custody of the person until the time of the hearing. Following the hearing, the judge shall issue an order to transfer custody under subsection (5) of this section unless the arrested person established by clear and convincing evidence that the arrested person is not the person identified in the warrant. If the court does not order transfer of custody, the judge shall order the arrested person to be released.

5. A judicial order to transfer custody issued under subsection (4) of this section shall be directed to a peace officer to take or retain custody of the person until a representative of the applicable noncertified tribe is available to take custody. If the noncertified tribe has not taken custody with three days, excluding weekends and holidays, the court may order the release of the person upon conditions that will assure the person's availability on a specified date with seven days.
