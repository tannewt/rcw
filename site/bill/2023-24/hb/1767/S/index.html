<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that recent federal legislation has significantly increased federal grant opportunities. Several federal laws provide funding for economic development clusters that Washington state has invested in as part of an economic development strategy, including broadband, clean energy, clean buildings, and clean transportation. This legislation includes, but is not limited to, the infrastructure investment and jobs act, P.L. 117-58, the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors (chips) and science act, P.L. 117-167, and the inflation reduction act, P.L. 117-169. Therefore, the legislature intends to increase the capacity of the department of commerce to help the state, local governments, tribes, and small businesses compete for federal grant dollars.</p>
