<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that improving the energy efficiency of, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from, existing residential buildings, including detached single-family homes, is critical to meeting the state's climate goals. The legislature further finds that making information about energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions available to homebuyers will help homebuyers make more informed decisions and that this information will cause the market to better value the efficiency and the greenhouse gas impacts of energy consumed in a home. The legislature further finds that home energy labeling programs have proven to be effective in other states.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a method for energy labeling of existing residential buildings.</p>

<li>
<p>By December 31, 2023, the department of commerce must adopt by rule the asset-based home energy score developed by the United States department of energy as the primary home energy performance scoring system by which a person may assign a residential building a score for the purpose of evaluating the energy efficiency and relative greenhouse gas emissions of the building.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asset-based systems measure the performance of the building itself and are not affected by the number of occupants or their behavior. The department of commerce may update its rules as it deems necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules adopted by the department of commerce must include the following information for labeling graphics and information for a home energy score:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Current home energy score, on a relative scale of one to 10, with 10 being best;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amount of energy use per year by fuel type;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unit prices, by fuel type, used to calculate energy costs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annual cost of energy, in dollars, by fuel type and total cost;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimated current carbon emissions in carbon dioxide equivalent tons per year. This measure must be depicted on a relative performance graphic scale from zero to 15 so that a report reader can visualize how a specific home compares to the worst and best possible greenhouse gas outcomes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sets of itemized recommendations for priority and for additional energy saving improvements. Priority improvements are those having an expected full economic payback of 10 or fewer years;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations for improving energy savings. Home improvement recommendations may include, but are not limited to, windows, and wall, roof, attic, and floor insulation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimated home energy score after recommended priority improvements are completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Itemized estimated energy savings, in dollars per year, after itemized recommended priority improvements are completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimated carbon reduction, in percent per year, after recommended priority improvements are completed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amount of renewable energy generated by the home in kilowatt-hours per year, if any;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessor information including the date of assessment, date of score expiration, name of assessor, assessor contact information, name of assessor's employer, and assessor's license number;</p>

<p>A statement indicating that the report meets Washington state standards for home energy score assessments; and</p>
