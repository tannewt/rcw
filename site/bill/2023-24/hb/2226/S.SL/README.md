    b. The actual geographic location of where the H-2A workers are living during their employment with the employer.

2. The department must compile the information and compare the number of workers sought by an employer on the employer's H-2A application with the number of H-2A workers actually working for the employer.

2. At a minimum, the surveys must:

    a. Gather information on wage rates received for harvesting activities;

    b. Include a question concerning whether the survey respondent made an unemployment insurance claim in the same period of time used to compile any list of unemployment claimants used as a basis for the phone survey described in this section;

    c. Gather information on the respondent's age, gender, and whether the respondent was born in the United States or the number of years the respondent has lived in the United States; and

    d. Gather information on whether the respondent earned the reported wages while working on a farm that employed H-2A workers to do the same kind of work.

3. The survey must:

    a. Be designed to receive responses from a minimum of 2,800 workers;

    b. Include field surveys designed to receive responses from a minimum of:

        i. 1,200 apple harvesters;

4. The survey may use a phone survey to gather the additional responses.

5. The department must provide $25 incentive payments for survey respondents who are eligible to respond to the survey.

6. The department must submit a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature annually by May 1st on surveys conducted under this section. The report must include:

    a. Information about the number of responses; and

    b. Individual responses, without names, including each respondent's answers to the inquiries described in subsection (2) of this section, except that unemployment claim data may be aggregated to the extent necessary to comply with federal law.

## Section 3
If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict and with respect to the agencies directly affected, and this finding does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act in its application to the agencies concerned. Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state.
