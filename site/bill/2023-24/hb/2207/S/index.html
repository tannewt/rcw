<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that, despite a modern waste disposal infrastructure, the occurrences of unlawful solid waste dumping are an increasing problem on open spaces such as privately and publicly owned forestlands. This irresponsible waste dumping, which often includes hazardous materials, asbestos, derelict boats, junk vehicles, appliances, furniture, and household garbage not only creates significant costs for the landowner, but also creates immediate, and sometimes lasting, environmental and habitat damage and degradation of recreational and aesthetic opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the current enforcement system, which relies on the criminalization of illegal dumping, may not be the most effective, efficient, or just penalty system. Converting all but the most egregious illegal dumping from a criminal act to a civil infraction creates a system of deterrence and penalties that better reflects the magnitude of the act, avoids criminal records for individuals who may be unable to afford appropriate waste management options, and reduces the burden on local criminal justice systems and infrastructures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that appropriate waste disposal can create a financial barrier for some individuals. In an effort to divert illegal dumping, a portion of the existing litter cleanup restitution payment should be diverted from direct payments to landowners to funding efforts to mitigate the costs of proper disposal, restitution, or environmental damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that landowners often discover derelict and abandoned maritime vessels on forestlands and other upland areas. These vessels often create an environmental hazard and always create a significant disposal cost for the landowner. The department of natural resources has administered a successful and legally tested vessel removal program for two decades. However, that program is limited to vessels found on or above aquatic lands. New or expanded tools are required for vessel owners avoiding the penalties inherent in the existing derelict vessel program by unlawfully disposing of their vessels on dry land.</p>

<p>There is hereby created an account within the state treasury to be known as the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account shall be used as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>40 percent of receipts from taxes imposed in RCW 82.19.010 to the department of ecology, primarily for use by the departments of ecology, natural resources, revenue, transportation, and corrections, and the parks and recreation commission, for litter collection programs under RCW 70A.200.170. The amount to the department of ecology shall also be used for a central coordination function for litter control efforts statewide; to support employment of youth in litter cleanup as intended in RCW 70A.200.020, and for litter pick up using other authorized agencies; and for statewide public awareness programs under RCW 70A.200.150(7). The amount to the department shall also be used to defray the costs of administering the funding, coordination, and oversight of local government programs for waste reduction, litter control, recycling, and composting so that local governments can apply one hundred percent of their funding to achieving program goals.

Recipients under this subsection include programs to reduce wasted food and food waste that are designed to achieve the goals established in RCW 70A.205.715(1) and that are consistent with the plan developed in RCW 70A.205.715(3). Grants must adhere to the following requirements: (A) No grant may exceed $60,000; (B) grant recipients shall match the grant funding allocated by the department by an amount equal to 25 percent of eligible expenses. A local government's share of these costs may be met by cash or contributed services; (C) the obligation of the department to make grant payments is contingent upon the availability of the amount of money appropriated for this subsection (1)(b); and (D) grants are managed under the guidelines for existing grant programs;</li>

The grants must be awarded for project descriptions aimed at reducing outdoor dumping or reducing the cost of legal waste disposal, such as education campaigns, free or reduced-cost collection days, income-based waste disposal coupons or vouchers, communication and funding partnerships with other entities such as landowners or collection companies, funding emphasis enforcement, funding information rewards, mitigation money to assist landowners with removing large items or a substantial quantity of illegally dumped material, and other measures reasonably targeted at reducing illegal dumping. The department may implement this subsection (1)(d) by including any funding and activities in existing or related programs managed by the department and may use a portion of receipts from the litter cleanup restitution payments for administration of the grants required by this section.</p>

A vessel disposal must be done in an environmentally sound manner and in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws, including the state solid waste disposal provisions provided for in chapter 70A.205 RCW. Scuttling or sinking of a vessel is only permissible after obtaining the express permission of the owner or owners of the aquatic lands below where the scuttling or sinking would occur, and obtaining all necessary state and federal permits or licenses.</p>

<p>For vessels not at a moorage facility, an authorized public entity with jurisdiction over the aquatic lands where the vessel is located or, for the purposes of the pilot project established in section 6 of this act, terrestrial lands where a derelict vessel is located may, at its discretion, request to assume primary responsibility for that particular vessel from the owner of the aquatic or terrestrial lands where the vessel is located.</p>
