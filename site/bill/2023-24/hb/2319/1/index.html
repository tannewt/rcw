<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that ensuring that individuals with substance use disorders can enter into and complete residential addiction treatment is an important public policy objective. Substance use disorder providers forcing patients to leave treatment prematurely and insurance authorization barriers both present impediments to realizing this goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that patients with substance use disorders should be provided information regarding and access to the full panoply of treatment options for their condition, as would be the case with any other life-threatening disease. Pharmacotherapies are incredibly effective and severely underutilized tools in the treatment of opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder. The federal food and drug administration has approved three medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder and three medications for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Only 37 percent of individuals with opioid use disorder and nine percent of individuals with alcohol use disorder receive medication to treat their condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to reduce forced patient discharges from residential addiction treatment, to remove arbitrary insurance authorization barriers to residential addiction treatment, and to ensure that patients with opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder receive access to care that is consistent with clinical best practices.</p>

<p>By October 1, 2024, each licensed or certified behavioral health agency providing voluntary inpatient or residential substance use disorder treatment services or withdrawal management services shall submit to the department any policies that the agency maintains regarding the transfer or discharge of a person without the person's consent from a facility providing those services. The policies that agencies must submit include any policies related to situations in which the agency transfers or discharges a person without the person's consent, therapeutic progressive disciplinary processes that the agency maintains, and procedures to assure safe transfers and discharges when a patient is discharged without the patient's consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By April 1, 2025, the department shall adopt a model policy for licensed or certified behavioral health agencies providing voluntary inpatient or residential substance use disorder treatment services or withdrawal management services to consider when adopting policies related to the transfer or discharge of a person without the person's consent from a facility providing those services. In developing the model policy, the department shall consider the policies submitted by agencies under (a) of this subsection and establish factors to be used in making a decision to transfer or discharge a person without the person's consent. Factors may include, but are not limited to, the person's medical condition, the clinical determination that the person no longer requires treatment or withdrawal management services at the facility, the risk of physical injury presented by the person to the person's self or to other persons at the facility, the extent to which the person's behavior risks the recovery goals of other persons at the facility, and the extent to which the agency has applied a therapeutic progressive disciplinary process. The model policy must include provisions addressing the use of an appropriate therapeutic progressive disciplinary process and procedures to assure safe transfers and discharges of a patient who is discharged without the patient's consent.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt rules to implement the reporting requirement under (a) of this subsection, using a standard form. The rules must require that the agency provide a description of the circumstances related to the person's departure from the facility, including whether the departure was voluntary or involuntary, the extent to which a therapeutic progressive disciplinary process was applied, the patient's self-reported understanding of the reasons for discharge, efforts that were made to avert the discharge, and efforts that were made to establish a safe discharge plan prior to the patient leaving the facility.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department may suspend, revoke, limit, restrict, or modify an approval, or refuse to grant approval, for failure to meet the provisions of this chapter, or the standards adopted under this chapter. RCW 43.70.115 governs notice of a license or certification denial, revocation, suspension, or modification and provides the right to an adjudicative proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No licensed or certified behavioral health agency may advertise or represent itself as a licensed or certified behavioral health agency if approval has not been granted or has been denied, suspended, revoked, or canceled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licensure or certification as a behavioral health agency is effective for one calendar year from the date of issuance of the license or certification. The license or certification must specify the types of services provided by the behavioral health agency that meet the standards adopted under this chapter.

</li>
<li>
<p>Licensed or certified behavioral health agencies may not provide types of services for which the licensed or certified behavioral health agency has not been certified. Licensed or certified behavioral health agencies may provide services for which approval has been sought and is pending, if approval for the services has not been previously revoked or denied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department periodically shall inspect licensed or certified behavioral health agencies at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon petition of the department and after a hearing held upon reasonable notice to the facility, the superior court may issue a warrant to an officer or employee of the department authorizing him or her to enter and inspect at reasonable times, and examine the books and accounts of, any licensed or certified behavioral health agency refusing to consent to inspection or examination by the department or which the department has reasonable cause to believe is operating in violation of this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall maintain and periodically publish a current list of licensed or certified behavioral health agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each licensed or certified behavioral health agency shall file with the department or the authority upon request, data, statistics, schedules, and information the department or the authority reasonably requires. A licensed or certified behavioral health agency that without good cause fails to furnish any data, statistics, schedules, or information as requested, or files fraudulent returns thereof, may have its license or certification revoked or suspended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority shall use the data provided in subsection (14) of this section to evaluate each program that admits children to inpatient substance use disorder treatment upon application of their parents. The evaluation must be done at least once every twelve months. In addition, the authority shall randomly select and review the information on individual children who are admitted on application of the child's parent for the purpose of determining whether the child was appropriately placed into substance use disorder treatment based on an objective evaluation of the child's condition and the outcome of the child's treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any settlement agreement entered into between the department and licensed or certified behavioral health agencies to resolve administrative complaints, license or certification violations, license or certification suspensions, or license or certification revocations may not reduce the number of violations reported by the department unless the department concludes, based on evidence gathered by inspectors, that the licensed or certified behavioral health agency did not commit one or more of the violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases in which a behavioral health agency that is in violation of licensing or certification standards attempts to transfer or sell the behavioral health agency to a family member, the transfer or sale may only be made for the purpose of remedying license or certification violations and achieving full compliance with the terms of the license or certification. Transfers or sales to family members are prohibited in cases in which the purpose of the transfer or sale is to avoid liability or reset the number of license or certification violations found before the transfer or sale. If the department finds that the owner intends to transfer or sell, or has completed the transfer or sale of, ownership of the behavioral health agency to a family member solely for the purpose of resetting the number of violations found before the transfer or sale, the department may not renew the behavioral health agency's license or certification or issue a new license or certification to the behavioral health service provider.</p>

In a review for inpatient or residential substance use disorder treatment services, a managed care organization may not consider a patient's length of abstinence when determining whether the services are medically necessary. If the health plan determines within one business day from the start of the medical necessity review period and receipt of the material provided under (c)(ii) of this subsection that the admission to the facility was not medically necessary and advises the agency of the decision in writing, the health plan is not required to pay the facility for services delivered after the start of the medical necessity review period, subject to the conclusion of a filed appeal of the adverse benefit determination. If the managed care organization's medical necessity review is completed more than one business day after the start of the medical necessity review period and receipt of the material provided under (c)(ii) of this subsection, the managed care organization must pay for the services delivered from the time of admission until the time at which the medical necessity review is completed and the agency is advised of the decision in writing.
