<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that whereas the THC concentration of cannabis-infused edible products is limited to 10 percent by state law and the THC concentration of cannabis flower is biologically limited, there is currently no limit on the potency of cannabis concentrates such as THC-infused vape oils, shatter, and dabs. High THC products are readily available with a THC concentration of nearly 100 percent. These high THC products bear little resemblance to the cannabis plant voters thought they were legalizing in 2012. Dr. Beatriz Carlini from the University of Washington's addictions, drug, and alcohol institute has described these highly concentrated products as &quot;as close to the cannabis plant as strawberries are to frosted strawberry pop tarts.&quot; Prior to Washington legalizing cannabis sales, many of these extremely high potency products did not exist or were not widely available. By 2019, sales of high THC products had grown to nearly 40 percent of total sales of cannabis products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington state's most prominent cannabis researchers at the University of Washington and Washington State University released a consensus statement about the public health risks posed by high THC products. That statement summarizes the best available science: &quot;Use of cannabis with high THC concentration increases the chances of developing cannabis use disorder or addiction to cannabis, particularly among adolescents. High-potency cannabis use can have lifelong mental health consequences, which often manifest in adolescence or early adulthood. Daily cannabis use, particularly of high-potency products, increases the risk of developing a psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia, and is related to an earlier onset of symptoms compared to people who do not use cannabis.&quot; In 2022, the addictions, drug, and alcohol institute at the University of Washington completed a legislatively funded report that made science-backed policy recommendations to stem the tide of public health harms associated with high THC products. Several of those recommendations are incorporated herein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that continued legislative inaction to curb the public health harms of high THC products will have serious consequences for all Washingtonians. Of individuals presenting to emergency departments with cannabis-induced first episode psychosis, 50 percent will receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia within eight years. Researchers have identified cannabis use disorder as a &quot;major modifiable risk factor for schizophrenia&quot; and noted &quot;an increasing proportion of cases of schizophrenia may be avertible by preventing cannabis use disorder and this increase is likely linked to the increase in THC concentration.&quot; Researchers estimate that up to 30 percent of cases of schizophrenia in young men ages 21 to 30 could be averted by preventing cannabis use disorder. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness for which there is no cure. The costs borne by state and local governments related to persons with schizophrenia, in terms of law enforcement and fire response, civil commitment, incarceration, competency evaluation and restoration, court costs, public defense services, psychiatric hospitalization, emergency department utilization, and housing and homelessness services far exceed the tax revenue generated from the sale of high THC products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to enact evidence-based public policy solutions to address the public health harms associated with high THC products.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to provide the department of health with recurring funding available each fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 2025, to allow the department of health to issue requests for proposals and contract for targeted public health messages and social marketing campaigns directed toward individuals most likely to suffer negative impacts of high THC products including persons under 25 years of age, persons reporting poor mental health, and persons living with mental health challenges. Messages and media campaigns funded must include information about risks, comparative dosing of cannabis products, and resources for persons seeking support for quitting or decreasing their intake of tetrahydrocannabinol. The content of public health messages and social marketing campaigns must be developed in partnership with persons targeted by the messages and campaigns and in consultation with professionals proficient in public health communication and in cannabis research.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>By July 1, 2025, the department of health must develop an optional training that cannabis retail staff may complete to better understand the health and safety impacts of high THC cannabis products. In developing the optional training, the department of health must consult with cannabis retail staff, cannabis consumers, persons who have been harmed by high THC products, health care providers, prevention professionals, researchers with relevant expertise, and behavioral health providers.</p>
