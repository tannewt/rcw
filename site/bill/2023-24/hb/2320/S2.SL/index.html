<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there is a growing body of research evidencing that consuming cannabis with high concentrations of THC may be harmful to some people, including younger persons and persons who have or are at risk for developing certain mental health conditions or psychotic disorders. Products like THC-infused vape oils, shatter, and dabs can contain close to 100 percent THC, and may carry risks not commonly associated with consumption of useable cannabis flower or other cannabis products with relatively lower THC concentrations. In the interest of public health, the legislature intends to review studies and consider increasing the minimum legal age of sale of high THC cannabis products to age 25, and the legislature intends to require caution notices, developed by the department of health, to be posted at the point of sale in cannabis retail outlets to raise awareness about possible health impacts and risks associated with high THC cannabis. The legislature further intends to implement and study health interventions, gather data, and ensure that new research, data, and information concerning the impacts of high THC cannabis continues to be incorporated into state policy.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to provide the department of health with recurring funding available each fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 2025, to allow the department of health to issue requests for proposals and contract for targeted public health messages and social marketing campaigns directed toward individuals most likely to suffer negative impacts of high THC products including persons under 25 years of age and persons living with mental health challenges. Messages and media campaigns funded must include information about risks, comparative dosing of cannabis products, and resources for persons seeking support for quitting or decreasing their intake of tetrahydrocannabinol. The content of public health messages and social marketing campaigns must be developed in partnership with persons targeted by the messages and campaigns and in consultation with professionals proficient in public health communication and in cannabis research.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>By July 1, 2025, the department of health must develop an optional training that cannabis retail staff may complete to better understand the health and safety impacts of high THC cannabis products. In developing the optional training, the department of health must consult with cannabis retail staff, cannabis consumers, persons who have been harmed by high THC products, health care providers, prevention professionals, researchers with relevant expertise, behavioral health providers, and representatives of licensed cannabis businesses.</p>
