2. The commissioner shall determine the percentage of paid claims related to family leave benefits and the percentage of paid claims related to medical leave benefits and set the family leave premium and the medical leave premium by applying the proportional share of paid claims for each type of leave to the total premium rate set in subsection (5) of this section.

    a. For family leave premiums, an employer may deduct from the wages of each employee up to the full amount of the premium required.

    a.

On or around October 20th of each year, the commissioner must calculate the total premium rate as follows:

        i. Calculate an amount that equals 140 percent of the prior fiscal year's expenses, including the total amount of benefits paid and the department's administrative costs;

        ii. Subtract the balance of the family and medical leave insurance account created in RCW 50A.05.070 as of September 30th from the amount determined in (a)(i) of this subsection (5); and

        iii. Divide the difference in (a)(ii) of this subsection (5) by the prior fiscal year's taxable wages. The quotient must be carried to the fourth decimal place and then rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of one percent.

    b. The commissioner must set the total premium rate at the rate calculated in (a) of this subsection (5) subject to the following conditions:

        i. If the commissioner determines the total premium rate calculated in (a) of this subsection exceeds a rate necessary to maintain a three-month reserve at the end of the following rate collection year, the commissioner must set the total premium rate at the minimum rate necessary to close the rate collection year with a three-month reserve; and

        ii. The total premium rate must not exceed 1.20 percent.

    c. For the purposes of this subsection (5):

        i. "Taxable wages" means the total amount of wages subject to a premium assessment under this section for all individuals in employment with an employer and all individuals electing coverage.

        ii. "Three-month reserve" means the average monthly expenses, including the total amount of benefits paid and the department's administrative costs, in the prior 12 calendar months from the date of the calculation in this subsection multiplied by three.

    c. Requiring private employers to supplement duration of leave or amount of wage replacement benefits provided under this title.

## Section 2
1. The legislature recognizes that while family leave and medical leave benefit both employees and employers, there may be costs that disproportionately impact small businesses.

    c. An employer may receive a grant under (a) or (b) of this subsection, but not both, except that an employer who received a grant under (b) of this subsection may receive a grant of the difference between the grant awarded under (b) of this subsection and $3,000 if the employee on leave extended the leave beyond the leave initially planned and the employer hired a temporary worker for the employee on leave.

4. An employer may apply for a grant no more than 10 times per calendar year and no more than once for each employee on leave.

5. To be eligible for a grant, the employer must provide the department written documentation showing the temporary worker hired or significant wage-related costs incurred are due to an employee's use of family or medical leave.

6.

The grants under this section shall be funded from the family and medical leave insurance account.

7. The commissioner shall adopt rules as necessary to implement this section.

For the purposes of determining eligibility for grants under this section, on September 30th of each year, the department shall average the number of employees reported by an employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to determine the size of the employer for the next calendar year.
