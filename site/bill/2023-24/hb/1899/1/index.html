<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2023, wildfires destroyed homes, businesses, infrastructure, and lives. The governor issued an emergency proclamation on August 19, 2023, covering all areas of the state and directed state agencies and departments to do everything reasonably possible to assist affected political subdivisions in an effort to respond to and recover from the event. The legislature intends to provide relief to people and communities by increasing flexibility and options for state building code compliance. The state building code council adopted new building codes that added more costs and complexity to all buildings. Many structures consumed by wildfires had insurance coverage based on repair or replacement costs drawn to the rules as they existed on January 1, 2023. To facilitate rebuilding communities, and in recognition of the terrible destruction that the wildfire victims face, the legislature declares that building permit applications repairing or rebuilding structures after wildfire damage may be built in compliance with state building code rules in effect on January 1, 2023, or the ones in place at the time of application.</p>
