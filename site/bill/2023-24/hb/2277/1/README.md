# HB 2277 - Data brokering

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2277.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The data consumers generate in nearly every moment of their modern lives in today's highly technological world enables the constant surveillance of any individual any time of the day and every day of the year. There has been rapid growth in the volume and variety of this personal data, which is known as behavioral surplus, being collected, analyzed, packaged, sold, purchased, monetized, and used in ways that are both helpful and harmful. This process is largely invisible to consumers and often happens without their awareness or consent. This growth has the potential for great benefits to human knowledge, technological innovation, and economic growth, but also the potential to harm individual privacy and freedom;

    b. Privacy is a deeply held value of Washington state residents, and Washington explicitly recognizes its citizens' right to privacy under Article I, section 7 of the state Constitution. Fundamental privacy rights have long been and continue to be integral to protecting Washingtonians and to safeguarding the democratic republic. Washington residents should have the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy in their movements, and thus should be free from ubiquitous and surreptitious surveillance;

    c. Washington is a technology leader on a national and global level and recognizes its distinctive position in promoting the efficient balance of consumer privacy and economic benefits. In addition, the technology industry has been a tremendous driver of economic growth in Washington state, but should not be based on the exploitation of its residents at the expense of their privacy; and

    d. Technological advances have outpaced the legislature's ability to protect consumers. Technology and businesses continue to push the limits of data collection with exponential rapidity. Laws must keep pace as technology and business practices evolve.

2. The legislature intends to lay the groundwork for improved protection of the privacy of the residents of Washington. Creating a policy that offers greater transparency and accountability of the actions of data brokers will allow consumers to understand which companies are engaged in brokering personal data. It is the intention of the legislature for this to lead to the creation of more robust privacy safeguards and improved ability of consumers to make informed decisions about how their personal data is collected and used.
