[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2275.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the unique needs of independent senior citizens warrant residential building requirements for senior independent living facilities that are different than those that apply to traditional, nonage-restricted multifamily residential developments.

2. The state building code council shall convene a technical advisory group for the purpose of recommending amendments to the rules or codes applicable to senior independent living facilities to enhance building accessibility and safety for independent senior citizens and persons with disabilities. The technical advisory group shall strive to align the rules or codes applicable to senior independent living facilities with the rules or codes applicable to assisted living facilities, nursing homes, long-term care facilities, and other similar living arrangements. When developing the recommendations, the technical advisory group must consult with experts in public health, fire and life safety, and building accessibility.

3. The technical advisory group shall provide its recommendations to the state building code council in time for the council to adopt or amend rules or codes as necessary for implementation in the 2024 code adoption cycle. The state building code council shall take action to adopt additions and amendments to rules or codes as necessary by July 1, 2026.

4. For the purposes of this section, "senior independent living facility" means any residential facility that is advertised, maintained, designed, or constructed for the express or implied purpose of providing housing for persons 55 years of age or older who are independent and do not require assistance with activities of daily living. Senior independent living facilities are typically designed to enable seniors to live on their own, but with the security and convenience of community living, including recreational, educational, and social activities. "Senior independent living facilities" do not include facilities that provide medical care or assistance with activities of daily living, such as assisted living facilities, nursing homes, long-term care facilities, or other similar living arrangements.

1. "Department" means the department of commerce.

2. "Resident" means any person who lives in a senior independent living facility.

3. "Senior independent living facility" means any residential facility that is advertised, maintained, designed, or constructed for the express or implied purpose of providing housing for persons 55 years of age or older who are independent and do not require assistance with activities of daily living. Senior independent living facilities are typically designed to enable seniors to live on their own, but with the security and convenience of community living, including recreational, educational, and social activities.

The rights provided in this section are minimum rights guaranteed to all residents of senior independent living facilities and are not intended to diminish any other rights provided in local, state, or federal laws.
