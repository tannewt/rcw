</li>
<li>
<p>Any individual who has firsthand knowledge of a violation of federal, state, or local laws, policies or procedures, or of improper or illegal actions related to elementary or secondary education and performed by an employee, contractor, student, parent or legal guardian of a student, or member of the public may submit a complaint to the office of the education ombuds.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a code of educator ethics is a statement of the values, ethical principles, and ethical standards to which every educator, regardless of role or rank, can aspire. As such, the legislature finds that a code of educator ethics can provide a common statewide framework for supporting Washington educators in the practice of their profession. The legislature does not intend a code of educator ethics to substitute for or replace an enforceable code of educator conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By September 1, 2025, and in accordance with RCW 43.01.036, the Washington professional educator standards board and the paraeducator board shall jointly report to the appropriate committees of the legislature a summary of their activities under this section, any planned activities by either board related to adopting a code of educator ethics, and any recommendations for legislative action, if necessary, related to state adoption of a code of ethics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report must advise the legislature on the following topics:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>How a code of educator ethics will support the development of an effective and comprehensive professional educator workforce;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether a model code of educator ethics will be adopted or adapted for Washington state, or whether a code of educator ethics unique to Washington state will be developed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any challenges that are anticipated with state adoption of a code of educator ethics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In meeting the requirements of this section, the Washington professional educator standards board and the paraeducator board must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Engage with their stakeholders across the professional educator spectrum; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the model code of ethics for educators, second edition, developed by the national association of state directors of teacher education and certification.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;educator&quot; refers to certificated administrative staff, certificated instructional staff, and paraeducators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section expires June 30, 2026.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the policy of this state to protect children from assault and abuse and to encourage parents and their authorized agents to use methods of correction and restraint of children that are not dangerous to the children. However, the physical discipline of a child is not unlawful when it is reasonable and moderate and is inflicted by a parent or guardian for purposes of restraining or correcting the child. Any use of force on a child by any other person is unlawful unless it either: (a) Is reasonable and moderate and is authorized in advance by the child's parent or guardian for purposes of restraining or correcting the child; or (b) complies with limitations on the use of student isolation and restraint under RCW 28A.600.485 including that it is used only when a student's behavior poses an imminent likelihood of serious harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following actions are presumed unreasonable when used to correct or restrain a child: (a) Throwing, kicking, burning, or cutting a child; (b) striking a child with a closed fist; (c) shaking a child under age three; (d) interfering with a child's breathing; (e) threatening a child with a deadly weapon; or (f) doing any other act that is likely to cause and which does cause bodily harm greater than transient pain or minor temporary marks. The age, size, and condition of the child and the location of the injury shall be considered when determining whether the bodily harm is reasonable or moderate. This list is illustrative of unreasonable actions and is not intended to be exclusive.</p>
