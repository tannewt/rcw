<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the commission shall develop training on a victim-centered, trauma-informed approach to interacting with victims and responding to sexual assault calls. The curriculum must: Be designed for commissioned patrol officers not regularly assigned to investigate sexual assault cases; be designed for deployment and use within individual law enforcement agencies; include features allowing for it to be used in different environments, which may include multimedia or video components; allow for law enforcement agencies to host it in small segments at different times over several days or weeks, including roll calls. The training must include components on available resources for victims including, but not limited to, material on and references to community-based victim advocates.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning in 2018, all law enforcement agencies shall annually host the training for commissioned peace officers. All law enforcement agencies shall, to the extent feasible, consult with and feature local community-based victim advocates during the training.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the commission shall conduct an annual case review program. The program must review case files from law enforcement agencies and prosecuting attorneys selected by the commission in order to identify changes to training and investigatory practices necessary to optimize outcomes in sexual assault investigations and prosecutions involving adult victims. The program must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An evaluation of whether current training and practices foster a trauma-informed, victim-centered approach to victim interviews and that identifies best practices and current gaps in training and assesses the integration of the community resiliency model;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comparison of cases involving investigators and interviewers who have participated in training to cases involving investigators and interviewers who have not participated in training;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Randomly selected cases for a systematic review to assess whether current practices conform to national best practices for a multidisciplinary approach to investigating sexual assault cases and interacting with survivors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An analysis of the impact that race and ethnicity have on sexual assault case outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>In designing and conducting the program, the commission shall consult and collaborate with experts in trauma-informed and victim-centered training, experts in sexual assault investigations and prosecutions, victim advocates, and other stakeholders identified by the commission.
