<p>A primary is a first stage in the public process by which voters elect candidates to public office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever candidates for a partisan office are to be elected, the general election must be preceded by a primary conducted under this chapter. Based upon votes cast at the primary, the top two candidates will be certified as qualified to appear on the general election ballot, unless only one candidate qualifies as provided in RCW 29A.36.170.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No primary may be held for any single county partisan office to fill an unexpired term if, after the last day allowed for candidates to withdraw, only one candidate has filed for the position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For partisan office, any party preference that a candidate chooses to identify with or express may not appear on the primary or general election ballot.</p>

<p>The text included in the voters' pamphlet by the secretary of state may not contain a candidate's political party preference or independent status , even when a candidate appearing on the ballot has expressed or identified with such a preference . Any candidate wishing to express the candidate's party preference or independent status in a voters' pamphlet may do so as part of the candidate's candidate statement.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>

The secretary of state shall adopt, by rule, a declaration of candidacy form for the office of precinct committee officer and a separate standard form for candidates for all other offices filing under this chapter. Included on the standard form shall be:</p>
