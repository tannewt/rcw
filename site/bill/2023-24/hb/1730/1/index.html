<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic created extreme labor shortages in certain industries, especially in the food service and hospitality industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that establishments traditionally classified as off-limits to persons under the age of 21 have experienced even greater labor challenges in occupations that do not involve the serving of alcohol or interacting with patrons, such as dishwashers, sanitation specialists, line cooks, prep cooks, fry cooks, and chefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that these occupations are critical entry-level jobs that help youth develop strong skills that translate into success in other workplaces and occupations later in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to allow, under specific and limited circumstances, youth between the ages of 18 to 21 to be employed in establishments traditionally classified as off-limits to persons under the age of 21.</p>
</li>
</ol>
