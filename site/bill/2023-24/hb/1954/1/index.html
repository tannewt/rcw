</li>
<li>
<p>The provision of, authorization of, recommendation of, aiding in, assistance in, referral for, or other participation in any reproductive health care services or gender-affirming treatment, by a license holder, if the participation would have been lawful and consistent with standards of care if it occurred entirely in Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conviction or disciplinary action based on the license holder's violation of another state's laws prohibiting the provision of, authorization of, recommendation of, aiding in, assistance in, referral for, or other participation in any reproductive health care services or gender-affirming treatment, if the participation would have been lawful and consistent with standards of care if it occurred entirely in Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as required by chapter 18.71B RCW, the following, alone or in combination, shall not serve as the basis for a denial of an application for licensure, licensure renewal, or temporary practice permit, or for any other disciplinary action by a disciplining authority against an applicant or license holder:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The provision of, authorization of, recommendation of, aiding in, assistance in, referral for, or other participation in any reproductive health care services or gender-affirming treatment consistent with the standard of care in Washington by a license holder;</p>

<li>
<p>A conviction or disciplinary action based on the license holder's violation of another state's laws prohibiting the provision of, authorization of, recommendation of, aiding in, assistance in, referral for, or other participation in any reproductive health care services or gender-affirming treatment, if the participation would have been lawful and consistent with standards of care if it occurred entirely in Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section prohibits the disciplining authority from taking action on separate charges that are unrelated to the provision of, authorization of, recommendation of, aiding in, assistance in, referral for, or other participation in any reproductive health care services or gender-affirming treatment that would have been lawful and consistent with standards of care if it occurred entirely in Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:</p>
