The board shall to the extent possible see to it that the grading of the examination, and the passing grades, are uniform with those applicable to all other states. The board may make use of all or a part of the uniform certified public accountant examination and advisory grading service of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and may contract with third parties to perform administrative services with respect to the examination as the board deems appropriate to assist it in performing its duties under this chapter. The board shall establish by rule provisions for transitioning to a new examination structure or to a new media for administering the examination.

Such an individual shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (3) of this section.

3. Any individual licensee of another state exercising the privilege afforded under  this section and the firm that employs that licensee simultaneously consent, as a condition of exercising this privilege:

5. An individual who qualifies for practice privileges under this section who performs services for which a firm license is required under RCW 18.04.195 and 18.04.215, shall not be required to obtain licensure under RCW 18.04.105 and 18.04.215.

## Section 12

2. The display or presentation by a person of a card, sign, advertisement, or other printed, engraved, or written instrument or device, bearing a person's name in conjunction with the words certified public accountant-inactive or any abbreviation thereof is prima facie evidence in any action brought under this chapter that the person whose name is so displayed caused or procured the display or presentation of the card, sign, advertisement, or other printed, engraved, or written instrument or device, and that the person is holding themself out to be a certified public accountant-inactive under this chapter.

Information, documents, or records that are publicly available are not to be construed as immune from discovery or use in any civil action, arbitration, administrative proceeding, or board proceeding merely because they were presented or considered in connection with the quality assurance or peer review process.

## Section 15
