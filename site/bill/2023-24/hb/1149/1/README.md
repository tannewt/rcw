## Section 101
This act may be known and cited as the Washington housing crisis response act.

## Section 102
The legislature finds that the state of Washington is facing a severe housing shortage that impacts the ability of many Washingtonians to obtain and maintain safe, stable, and affordable housing. The legislature recognizes that multiple factors contribute to the housing crisis, and that the combination of those factors has resulted in a housing deficit of more than 50,000 units for over a decade. The legislature finds that the deficit of new housing necessary to accommodate our growing population was 81,400 units in 2021. The legislature finds that every $100 increase in rent is associated with a 9 percent increase in homelessness, and that 40 percent of Washington households are spending more than 35 percent of their income on rent. The legislature finds that, to keep up with population projections, the state of Washington will need to construct an additional 1,000,000 housing units by 2040. The legislature finds that in order to meet the growing need for new housing, and to address the backlog of housing construction necessary to serve the current population, the state must make significant investments in housing. These investments include emergency, transitional, permanent supportive, permanent, and market rate housing to meet the diverse needs of all Washingtonians in every corner of the state. The legislature finds that a significant number of individuals facing housing instability or homelessness also have behavioral health needs that are not fully supported or addressed. The legislature recognizes behavioral health treatment capacity is essential to increasing and maintaining housing access and stability for all Washingtonians, including those with mental health and substance use conditions. The legislature intends to support these needs by issuing bonds to provide new money for capital programs and projects that are critical to addressing the state's housing crisis.

## Section 201
1. The state finance committee is authorized to issue general obligation bonds of the state of Washington for the purpose of reducing homelessness by providing capital funding for selected programs and projects that address housing insecurity, as identified in this act and any omnibus capital appropriations act. The state finance committee is authorized to issue such bonds in the sum of $4,000,000,000, or so much thereof as may be required, for the stated purpose and all costs incidental thereto. The bonds issued under the authority of this section shall be known as Washington housing crisis response act bonds.

2. Bonds authorized in this section must be sold in the manner, at the time or times, in amounts, and at such prices as the state finance committee determines.

3. The authorization to issue bonds contained in this act does not expire until the full authorization has been issued.

4. No bonds authorized in this section may be offered for sale without prior legislative appropriation of the net proceeds of the sale of the bonds.

## Section 202
1. The nondebt-limit general fund bond retirement account must be used for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds authorized in section 201 of this act.

2. The state finance committee must, on or before June 30th of each year, certify to the state treasurer the amount needed in the ensuing 12 months to meet the bond retirement and interest requirements on the bonds authorized in section 201 of this act.

3. On each date on which any interest or principal and interest payment is due on bonds issued under section 201 of this act, the state treasurer shall withdraw from any general state revenues received in the state treasury and deposit in the nondebt-limit general fund bond retirement account an amount equal to the amount certified by the state finance committee to be due on the payment date.

## Section 203
1. The state finance committee is authorized to prescribe the form, terms, conditions, and covenants of the bonds authorized in section 201 of this act, the time or times of sale of all or any portion of them, and the conditions and manner of their sale and issuance.

2. Bonds issued under this act shall state that they are a general obligation of the state of Washington, shall pledge the full faith and credit of the state to the payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, and shall contain an unconditional promise to pay the principal and interest as the same shall become due.

3. The owner and holder of each of the bonds or the trustee for the owner and holder of any of the bonds may by mandamus or other appropriate proceeding require the transfer and payment of funds as directed in this section.

## Section 204

## Section 205
The bonds authorized by section 201 of this act shall constitute a legal investment for all state funds or for funds under state control and all funds of municipal corporations.

## Section 206
The legislature may provide additional means for raising moneys for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds authorized in section 201 of this act, and section 202 of this act may not be deemed to provide an exclusive method for payment.

## Section 207
If the state finance committee deems it necessary to issue any portion of the bonds authorized in section 201 of this act as taxable bonds in order to comply with federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds, the proceeds of such taxable bonds must be transferred to the Washington housing crisis response taxable account created in section 402 of this act in lieu of any deposits otherwise provided by section 204 of this act. The state treasurer, on behalf of the state finance committee, must submit written notice to the director of the office of financial management if it is determined that any such transfer to the Washington housing crisis response taxable account is necessary. If such a transfer is required, a portion of the appropriation authority granted in any omnibus capital appropriations act from the Washington housing crisis response account is transferred to the Washington housing crisis response taxable account in an amount equal to the transferred proceeds. For purposes of this section, "nontaxable bond proceeds" includes proceeds from bonds issued as tax exempt bonds and proceeds from taxable bonds eligible for direct federal subsidy or other federal tax advantage under the federal internal revenue code and internal revenue service rules.
