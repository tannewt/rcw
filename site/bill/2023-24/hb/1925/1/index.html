</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application process for the veterans service officer program must be prescribed as to manner and form by the department.</p>

<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;veterans service officer&quot; means an accredited veterans service officer funded by the veterans service officer fund created in RCW 43.60A.235.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is created in the custody of the state treasurer an account to be known as the veterans service officer fund. Revenues to the fund consist of appropriations by the legislature, private contributions, and all other sources deposited in the fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expenditures from the fund may only be used for the purposes of the veterans service officer program under RCW 43.60A.230 and section 1 of this act, including administrative expenses. Only the director, or the director's designee, may authorize expenditures. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>
