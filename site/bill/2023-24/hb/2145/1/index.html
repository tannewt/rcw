<p>All medical necessity determinations made by the health carrier concerning service intensity, level of care placement, continued stay, and transfer or discharge of enrollees diagnosed with mental health and substance use disorders shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of section 3 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A health carrier that authorizes a specific type of treatment by a provider pursuant to this section shall not rescind or modify the authorization after the provider renders the health care service in good faith and pursuant to this authorization for any reason including, but not limited to, the health carrier's subsequent rescission, cancellation, or modification of the enrollee's contract, or the health carrier's subsequent determination that it did not make an accurate determination of the enrollee's eligibility. This section shall not be construed to expand or alter the benefits available to the enrollee under a health plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A health carrier shall not limit benefits or coverage for medically necessary services on the basis that those services should be or could be covered by a public entitlement program including, but not limited to, special education or an individualized education program, medicaid, medicare, supplemental security income, or social security disability insurance, and shall not include or enforce a contract term that excludes otherwise covered benefits on the basis that those services should be or could be covered by a public entitlement program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A health carrier shall not adopt, impose, or enforce terms in its policies or provider agreements, in writing or in operation, that undermine, alter, or conflict with the requirements of this section.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A health carrier that provides hospital, medical, or surgical coverage shall base any medical necessity determination or the utilization review criteria that the health carrier, and any entity acting on the carrier's behalf, applies to determine the medical necessity of health care services and benefits for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders on current generally accepted standards of mental health and substance use disorder care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conducting utilization review of all covered health care services and benefits for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders in children, adolescents, and adults, a health carrier shall apply the criteria and practice guidelines set forth in the most recent versions of such criteria and practice guidelines, developed by the nonprofit professional association for the relevant clinical specialty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conducting utilization review involving level of care placement decisions or any other patient care decisions that are within the scope of the sources specified in subsection (2) of this section, a health carrier shall not apply different, additional, conflicting, or more restrictive utilization review criteria than the criteria and guidelines set forth in those sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the proper use of the criteria described in subsection (2) of this section, every health carrier shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Sponsor a formal education program by nonprofit clinical specialty associations to educate the health carrier's staff, including any third parties contracted with the health carrier to review claims, conduct utilization reviews, or make medical necessity determinations about the clinical review criteria;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the education program available to other stakeholders, including the health carrier's participating providers and covered lives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide, at no cost, the clinical review criteria and any training material or resources to providers and enrollees;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track, identify, and analyze how the clinical review criteria are used to certify care, deny care, and support the appeals process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct interrater reliability testing to ensure consistency in utilization review decision making covering how medical necessity decisions are made. This assessment shall cover all aspects of utilization review;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run interrater reliability reports about how the clinical guidelines are used in conjunction with the utilization management process and parity compliance activities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve interrater reliability pass rates of at least 90 percent and, if this threshold is not met, immediately provide for the remediation of poor interrater reliability and interrater reliability testing for all new staff before they can conduct utilization review without supervision.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section applies to all health care services and benefits for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders covered by a health plan, including prescription drugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section applies to a health carrier that covers hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and conducts utilization review, and any entity or contracting provider that performs utilization review or utilization management functions on a health carrier's behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commissioner determines that a health carrier has violated this section, the commissioner may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing as required under chapters 48.04 and 34.05 RCW, by order, assess a civil monetary penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each violation, or, if a violation was willful, a civil monetary penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation. The civil monetary penalties available to the commissioner pursuant to this section are not exclusive and may be sought and employed in combination with any other remedies available to the commissioner under this chapter.</p>

<p>A carrier may not adopt, impose, or enforce terms in its policies or provider agreements, in writing or in operation, that undermine, alter, or conflict with the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a health carrier contract issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2025, contains a provision that reserves discretionary authority to the carrier, or an agent of the carrier, to determine eligibility for benefits or coverage, interpret the terms of the contract, or provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the laws of this state, that provision is void and unenforceable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, the term &quot;discretionary authority&quot; means a contract provision that has the effect of conferring discretion on a health carrier or other claims administrator to determine entitlement to benefits or interpret contract language related to mental health and substance use disorders that, in turn, could lead to a deferential standard of review by a reviewing court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not prohibit a health carrier from including a provision in a contract that informs an enrollee that, as part of its routine operations, the plan applies the terms of its contracts for making decisions, including making determinations regarding eligibility, receipt of benefits and claims, or explaining policies, procedures, and processes, so long as the provision could not give rise to a deferential standard of review by a reviewing court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
