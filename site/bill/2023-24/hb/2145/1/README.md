2. For purposes of this section, the term "discretionary authority" means a contract provision that has the effect of conferring discretion on a health carrier or other claims administrator to determine entitlement to benefits or interpret contract language related to mental health and substance use disorders that, in turn, could lead to a deferential standard of review by a reviewing court.
