# HB 2377 - Laser hair removal

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2377.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that laser hair removal is a medical procedure, and its practice by unqualified persons presents a danger to the public health and safety. Because it is difficult for the public to make informed choices related to laser hair removal services, and because the consequences of wrong choices can harm the public health and safety, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure that laser hair removal is only performed by persons who possess the proper licensure and skills. However, it is the intent of the legislature to impose restrictions only to the extent necessary to protect the public and in a manner that will not unreasonably affect the competitive market for the safe and effective delivery of such services.
