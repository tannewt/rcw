# HB 1966 - Exempting manufacturing machinery and equipment from real estate excise tax.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1966.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that manufacturing is a vital part of Washington state's economy, providing family-wage jobs throughout the state, accompanied by a multiplier effect that often makes these employers hubs of their local communities. The legislature finds that manufacturing jobs in Washington state have been in decline, losing over 50,000 jobs since the year 2000. The legislature finds that the enactment in 1995 of a sales and use tax exemption for manufacturing machinery and equipment under RCW 82.08.02565 and 82.12.02565 intended to exempt such property from taxation upon a transfer or sale of a manufacturing facility. The legislature finds that Washington state courts have long characterized manufacturing machinery and equipment installed in various manufacturing facilities as personal property. The legislature finds that the tax treatment of such property varies by county as some county assessors characterize manufacturing machinery and equipment as personal property and some place it on real property rolls, with a tendency to assess real estate excise tax on the latter. The legislature finds that this leads to unequal treatment of manufacturers across Washington state and, particularly as the real estate excise tax increases, places an unintended tax burden on manufacturers. It is the intent of the legislature to enhance taxpayer equity and resolve this source of uncertainty for all manufacturers in Washington state. It is the intent of the legislature to increase the sustainability of the manufacturing industry in Washington state as well as its competitiveness around the world to enable manufacturing to continue to be a critical and growing source of family-wage jobs throughout the state.
