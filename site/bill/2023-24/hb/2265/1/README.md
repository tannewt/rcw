# HB 2265 - Climbing facilities

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2265.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that practicing the sport of rock climbing in a climbing facility helps facilitate equitable and adaptive access to physical activity that significantly contributes to the Washington state recreational activity economy. The legislature further finds that the practice of the sport of rock climbing in a climbing facility contains both inherent risks, regardless of any and all safety measures which can be employed, and other risks that can be hazardous to participants, and that those risks should be managed. Therefore, defining the duties and responsibilities of climbing facility operators and participants is in the public interest.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Climbing facility" means a facility or premises that contains a fixed, artificial climbing surface used by the public, not located in an amusement park, carnival, family entertainment center, or on public land, that is designed and built for the sport of climbing.

2. "Climbing facility operator" means a person or entity who owns, manages, controls, directs, or has operational responsibility for a climbing facility.

3. "Department" means the department of licensing.

4. "Participant" means a person in a climbing facility for the purpose of engaging in the sport of climbing. "Participant" includes anyone utilizing a climbing wall or personal protective equipment, belaying, or spectating.

5. "Personal protective equipment" means harnesses, carabiners, belay devices, auto belay devices, ropes, and other items designed to protect a participant from injury while using a climbing facility.

## Section 3
1. After January 1, 2026, no climbing facility operator may operate a climbing facility in this state without a license as required under this chapter.

2. An applicant shall apply for a license with the department upon forms provided by the department that contain such information that the department reasonably requires, which may include affirmative evidence of the ability to comply with rules and regulations as prescribed in this chapter.

3. Each application for license or renewal of license must be accompanied by a reasonable license fee as established by the department. Any fees or fines collected under the authority of this chapter must be deposited into the business and professions account created in RCW 43.24.150.

4. Upon receipt of an application for a license and the license fee, the department shall issue a license if the applicant and climbing facility meets the requirements established under this chapter. A license, unless suspended or revoked, must be renewable annually. Applications for renewal must be on forms provided by the department and must be filed with the department not less than 10 days prior to the license's expiration date. Each license may be issued only for the premises and persons named in the application and is not transferable or assignable except with the written approval of the department.

5. The license must be posted in a conspicuous place at the climbing facility.

    f. Exercise good judgment and act in a responsible manner while in the climbing facility.

## Section 7
1.

    b. If the climbing facility or a climbing facility operator intentionally injures the participant.

The contributory fault provisions of chapter 4.22 RCW are not applicable in cases where bodily injury or death is deemed to have been caused by the inherent and assumed risks of climbing.
