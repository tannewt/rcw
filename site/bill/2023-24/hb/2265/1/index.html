<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that practicing the sport of rock climbing in a climbing facility helps facilitate equitable and adaptive access to physical activity that significantly contributes to the Washington state recreational activity economy. The legislature further finds that the practice of the sport of rock climbing in a climbing facility contains both inherent risks, regardless of any and all safety measures which can be employed, and other risks that can be hazardous to participants, and that those risks should be managed. Therefore, defining the duties and responsibilities of climbing facility operators and participants is in the public interest.</p>

<p>Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a climbing facility or a climbing facility operator is not liable for bodily injury or death of a participant engaged in the sport of indoor rock climbing caused by the inherent and assumed risks of climbing enumerated in section 6 of this act, and, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no participant nor participant's representative may maintain an action against or recover from a climbing facility or a climbing facility operator for bodily injury or death of a participant engaged in the sport of climbing caused by the inherent and assumed risks of climbing enumerated in section 6 of this act or otherwise.</p>
