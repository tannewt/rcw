<p>The certified exclusive bargaining representative is responsible for representing the interests of all the employees in the bargaining unit.

In determining the new units or modifications of existing units, the commission must consider: The duties, skills, and working conditions of the employees; the history of collective bargaining; the extent of organization among the employees; the desires of the employees; and the avoidance of excessive fragmentation. However, a unit is not appropriate if it includes:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Both partisan and nonpartisan employees;</p>

<p>If a single employee organization is the exclusive bargaining representative for two or more units, upon petition by the employee organization, the units may be consolidated into a single larger unit if the commission considers the larger unit to be appropriate. If consolidation is appropriate, the commission shall certify the employee organization as the exclusive bargaining representative of the new unit.</p>

<li>
<p>Negotiation for economic terms will be by a coalition of all exclusive bargaining representatives.

<p>If the parties to a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under this chapter agree to final and binding arbitration under grievance procedures allowed by section 7 of this act, the parties may agree on one or more permanent umpires to serve as arbitrator, or may agree on any impartial person to serve as arbitrator, or may agree to select arbitrators from any source available to them, including federal and private agencies, in addition to the staff and list of arbitrators maintained by the commission. If the parties cannot agree to the selection of an arbitrator, the commission must supply a list of names in accordance with the procedures established by the commission.</p>

<p>Except as limited by this chapter, an arbitrator may require any person to attend as a witness and to bring with them any book, record, document, or other evidence. The fees for such attendance must be paid by the party requesting issuance of the subpoena and must be the same as the fees of witnesses in the superior court. Arbitrators may administer oaths. Subpoenas must issue and be signed by the arbitrator and must be served in the same manner as subpoenas to testify before a court of record in this state. If any person so summoned to testify refuses or neglects to obey such subpoena, upon petition authorized by the arbitrator, the superior court may compel the attendance of the person before the arbitrator or punish the person for contempt in the same manner provided for the attendance of witnesses or the punishment of them in the courts of this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as limited by this chapter, the arbitrator shall appoint a time and place for the hearing and notify the parties thereof, and may adjourn the hearing from time to time as may be necessary, and, on application of either party and for good cause, may postpone the hearing to a time not extending beyond the date fixed by the collective bargaining agreement for making the award. The arbitration award must be in writing and signed by the arbitrator. The arbitrator must, promptly upon its rendition, serve a true copy of the award on each of the parties or their attorneys of record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a party to a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under this chapter that includes final and binding arbitration refuses to submit a grievance for arbitration, the other party to the collective bargaining agreement may invoke the jurisdiction of the superior court of Thurston county and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue an order compelling arbitration. Disputes concerning compliance with grievance procedures shall be reserved for determination by the arbitrator. Arbitration shall be ordered if the grievance states a claim that on its face is covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Doubts as to the coverage of the arbitration clause shall be resolved in favor of arbitration.</p>
