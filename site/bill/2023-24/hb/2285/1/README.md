An entity administering a self-funded health benefits plan that elects to participate under this section, shall comply with the provisions of RCW 48.49.020 , 48.49.030, 48.49.040, 48.49.160, and section 8 of this act.

## Section 8
1. For health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2025, a nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization may not balance bill an enrollee for covered ground ambulance services.

2. If an enrollee receives covered ground ambulance services:

    a. The enrollee satisfies their obligation to pay for the ground ambulance services if they pay the in-network cost-sharing amount specified in the enrollee's or applicable group's health plan contract. The enrollee's obligation must be calculated using the allowed amount determined under subsection (3) of this section. The carrier shall provide an explanation of benefits to the enrollee and the nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization that reflects the cost-sharing amount determined under this subsection;

    b. The carrier, nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization, and any agent, trustee, or assignee of the carrier or nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization shall ensure that the enrollee incurs no greater cost than the amount determined under (a) of this subsection;

    c. The nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization and any agent, trustee, or assignee of the nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization may not balance bill or otherwise attempt to collect from the enrollee any amount greater than the amount determined under (a) of this subsection. This does not impact the ground ambulance services organization's ability to collect a past due balance for that cost-sharing amount with interest;

    d. The carrier shall treat any cost-sharing amounts determined under (a) of this subsection paid by the enrollee for a nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization's services in the same manner as cost sharing for health care services provided by an in-network ground ambulance services organization and must apply any cost sharing amounts paid by the enrollee for such services toward the enrollee's maximum out-of-pocket payment obligation; and

    e. A ground ambulance services organization shall refund any amount in excess of the in-network cost-sharing amount to an enrollee within 30 business days of receipt if the enrollee has paid the nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization an amount that exceeds the in-network cost-sharing amount determined under (a) of this subsection. Interest must be paid to the enrollee for any unrefunded payments at a rate of 12 percent beginning on the first calendar day after the 30 business days.

3. The allowed amount paid to a nonparticipating ground ambulance services organization for covered ground ambulance services under a health plan issued by a carrier must be one of the following amounts:

    a. If a local governmental entity has submitted a rate to the office of the insurance commissioner under section 9 of this act, the rate set by the local governmental entity in the jurisdiction in which the covered health care services originated; or

    b. If the local governmental entity has not submitted a rate to the office of the insurance commissioner under section 9 of this act, the lesser of:

        i. 325 percent of the current published rate for ambulance services as established by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services under Title XVIII of the social security act for the same service provided in the same geographic area; or

        ii. The ground ambulance services organization's billed charges.

4. Payment made in compliance with this section is payment in full for the covered services provided, except for any in-network copayment, coinsurance, deductible, and other cost-sharing amounts required to be paid by the enrollee.

5. The carrier shall make payments for ground ambulance services provided by nonparticipating ground ambulance services organizations directly to the organization, rather than the enrollee.

6. A ground ambulance services organization may not request or require a patient at any time, for any procedure, service, or supply, to sign or otherwise execute by oral, written, or electronic means, any document that would attempt to avoid, waive, or alter any provision of this section.

7. Carriers shall make available through electronic and other methods of communication generally used by a ground ambulance services organization to verify enrollee eligibility and benefits information regarding whether an enrollee's health plan is subject to the requirements of this section.

8. For purposes of this chapter, ground ambulance services organizations are not considered providers. RCW 48.49.020, 48.49.030, 48.49.040, and 48.49.160 do not apply to ground ambulance services or ground ambulance services organizations.

## Section 9
A local governmental entity may submit to the office of the insurance commissioner, in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner, the rate set by the local governmental entity as authorized in RCW 35.27.370, 35.23.456, or 52.12.135, or chapter 35.21 RCW, for purposes of section 8 of this act. The commissioner shall establish and maintain, directly or through the lead organization for administrative simplification designated under RCW 48.165.030, a publicly accessible database for the rates. A carrier may rely in good faith on the rates shown on the website. Local governmental entities are solely responsible for submitting any updates to their rates to the commissioner or the lead organization for administrative simplification, as directed by the commissioner.

## Section 10
1. The commissioner must undertake a process to review the reasonableness of the percentage of the medicare rate established in section 8 of this act and any trends in changes to ground ambulance services rates set by local governmental entities. In conducting the review, the commissioner should consider the relationship of the rates to the cost of providing ground ambulance services and any impacts on health plan enrollees that may result from health plans increasing in-network consumer cost-sharing for ground ambulance services due to increased rates paid for these services by carriers.

2. The results of the review must be submitted to the legislature by the earlier of:

    a. October 1, 2027; or

    b. October 1st following any update in medicare ground ambulance services payment rates by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services.

## Section 11
If the insurance commissioner reports to the department that they have cause to believe that a ground ambulance services organization has engaged in a pattern of violations of section 8 of this act, and the report is substantiated after investigation, the department may levy a fine upon the ground ambulance services organization in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation and take other formal or informal disciplinary action as permitted under the authority of the department.

## Section 12
1. For health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2025, a health carrier shall provide coverage for ground ambulance transports to behavioral health emergency services providers for enrollees who are experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined in RCW 48.43.005. A health carrier may not require prior authorization of ground ambulance services if a prudent layperson acting reasonably would have believed that an emergency medical condition existed.

2. Coverage of ground ambulance transports to behavioral health emergency services providers may be subject to applicable in-network copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles, as provided in chapter 48.49 RCW.

## Section 13
1. The office of the insurance commissioner, in consultation with the health care authority, shall contract for an actuarial analysis of the cost, potential cost savings, and total net costs or savings of covering services provided by ground ambulance services organizations when a ground ambulance services organization is dispatched to the scene of an emergency and the person is treated but is not transported to a hospital or behavioral health emergency services provider. The analysis must calculate net costs or savings separately for the individual, small group, and large group health plan markets and for public and school employee programs administered under chapter 41.05 RCW. The analysis should consider, at a minimum:

    a. The proportion of ground ambulance dispatches that do not result in patient transport to a hospital or behavioral health emergency services provider;

    b. Appropriate payment rates for these services;

    c. Any potential impact of coverage of these services on the number or type of transports to hospitals or behavioral health emergency services providers and associated costs or cost savings; and

    d. Other considerations identified by the commissioner.

2. The report must include the findings of the actuarial analysis described in this section and recommendations related to whether the services described in this section should be treated as covered services under health plans issued or renewed in Washington state and health benefit programs for public and school employees administered under chapter 41.05 RCW. The office of the insurance commissioner shall submit the report to the legislature by October 1, 2025.

## Section 14
1. The Washington state institute for public policy, in collaboration with the department, the health care authority, and the office of the insurance commissioner, shall conduct a study and develop recommendations on whether emergency medical services should be treated as an essential health service provided by state and local governmental entities and funded exclusively by federal, state, or local governmental entities as a public health service.

2. The institute shall consider the following elements in conducting the study:

    a. Trends in the number and types of emergency medical services available and the volume of 911 responses and interfacility transports provided by emergency medical services organizations over time and by county in Washington state;

    b. Projections of the need for emergency medical services in Washington state counties over the next 10 years;

    c. Identification of geographic areas in Washington state without access to emergency medical services within an average 30-minute response time;

    d. Estimates for the cost to address gaps in emergency medical services so all parts of the state are assured a timely response; and

    e. Models for funding emergency medical services that are used by other states.

3. In conducting the study, the institute shall consult with emergency medical services organizations, local governmental entities, hospitals, labor organizations representing emergency medical services personnel, and other interested entities as determined by the institute in consultation with the department, the health care authority, and the office of the insurance commissioner.

4. The report and recommendations must be submitted to relevant policy and fiscal committees of the legislature on or before October 1, 2026.
