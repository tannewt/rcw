<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this section and sections 2 through 6 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Automated traffic safety camera&quot; means a device that uses a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with an intersection traffic control system, a railroad grade crossing control system, or a speed measuring device, and a camera synchronized to automatically record one or more sequenced photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images of the front or rear of a motor vehicle at the time the vehicle fails to stop when facing a steady red traffic control signal or an activated railroad grade crossing control signal, or exceeds a speed limit as detected by a speed measuring device. &quot;Automated traffic safety camera&quot; also includes a device used to detect stopping at intersection or crosswalk violations; stopping when traffic obstructed violations; public transportation only lane violations; and stopping or traveling in restricted lane violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Hospital speed zone&quot; means the marked area within hospital property and extending 300 feet from the border of the hospital property (a) consistent with hospital use; and (b) where signs are posted to indicate the location is within a hospital speed zone, where &quot;hospital&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 70.41.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Public park speed zone&quot; means the marked area within public park property and extending 300 feet from the border of the public park property (a) consistent with active park use; and (b) where signs are posted to indicate the location is within a public park speed zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Public transportation vehicle&quot; means any motor vehicle, streetcar, train, trolley vehicle, ferry boat, or any other device, vessel, or vehicle that is owned or operated by a transit authority or an entity providing service on behalf of a transit authority that is used for the purpose of carrying passengers and that operates on established routes. &quot;Transit authority&quot; has the same meaning as provided in RCW 9.91.025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;School speed zone&quot; means the marked crosswalk adjacent to a school and the 300 feet in either direction of the crosswalk on a roadway as indicated by standard school speed limit signs or standard playground speed limit signs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;School walk zone&quot; has the same meaning as described in RCW 46.61.440.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Work zone&quot; means an area of any city or county roadway with construction, maintenance, or utility work with a duration of 30 calendar days or more. A work zone is identified by the placement of temporary traffic control devices that may include signs, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, and/or work vehicles with warning lights. It extends from the first warning sign or high intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights on a vehicle to the end road work sign or the last temporary traffic control device or vehicle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section prohibits a law enforcement officer from issuing a notice of traffic infraction to a person in control of a vehicle at the time a violation occurs under RCW 46.63.030(1) (a), (b), or (c).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities and counties may authorize the use of traffic safety cameras through an ordinance adopted by the local legislative authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local legislative authority must prepare an analysis of the locations within the jurisdiction where automated traffic safety cameras are proposed to be located before adding traffic safety cameras or relocating any existing camera to a new location within the jurisdiction. The analysis must include equity considerations including the impact of the camera placement on livability, accessibility, economics, education, and environmental health, and shall consider the outcome of that analysis when identifying where to locate an automated traffic safety camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated traffic safety cameras may not be used on an on-ramp to a limited access facility as defined in RCW 47.52.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city government may use automated traffic safety cameras to enforce traffic ordinances in this section on state highways that are also classified as city streets under chapter 47.24 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At a minimum, a local ordinance adopted pursuant to this section must contain the restrictions described in this section and provisions for public notice and signage. Cities and counties using automated traffic safety cameras before July 24, 2005, are subject to the restrictions described in this section, but are not required to adopt an authorizing ordinance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cities and counties using automated traffic safety cameras must post an annual report on the city or county's website of the number of traffic crashes that occurred at each location where an automated traffic safety camera is located, as well as the number of notices of infraction issued for each camera. The annual report must include the percentage of revenues received from fines issued from automated traffic safety camera infractions that were used to pay for the costs of the automated traffic safety camera program and must describe the uses of revenues that exceeded the costs of operation and administration of the automated traffic safety camera program by the city or county.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All locations where an automated traffic safety camera is used on roadways or intersections must be clearly marked by placing signs at least 30 days prior to activation of the camera in locations that clearly indicate to a driver either that: (a) The driver is within an area where automated traffic safety cameras are authorized; or (b) the driver is entering an area where violations are enforced by an automated traffic safety camera. Signs placed in automated traffic safety camera locations after June 7, 2012, must follow the specifications and guidelines under the manual of uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways as adopted by the department of transportation under chapter 47.36 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated traffic safety cameras may only record images of the vehicle and vehicle license plate and only while an infraction is occurring. The image must not reveal the face of the driver or of passengers in the vehicle. The primary purpose of camera placement is to record images of the vehicle and vehicle license plate when an infraction is occurring. Cities and counties must consider installing automated traffic safety cameras in a manner that minimizes the impact of camera flash on drivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A notice of infraction must be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within 14 days of the violation, or to the renter of a vehicle within 14 days of establishing the renter's name and address under subsection (18) of this section. The notice of infraction must include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a violation under this chapter. The photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images evidencing the violation must be available for inspection and admission into evidence in a proceeding to adjudicate the liability for the infraction. A person receiving a notice of infraction based on evidence detected by an automated traffic safety camera may respond to the notice by mail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible for an infraction under RCW 46.63.030(1)(d) unless the registered owner overcomes the presumption in RCW 46.63.075, or, in the case of a rental car business, satisfies the conditions under subsection (18) of this section. If appropriate under the circumstances, a renter identified under subsection (18)(a) of this section is responsible for an infraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images, or any other personally identifying data prepared under this section are for the exclusive use of authorized city or county employees in the discharge of duties under this section and are not open to the public and may not be used in a court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a violation under this section. No photograph, microphotograph, or electronic image, or any other personally identifying data may be used for any purpose other than enforcement of violations under this section nor retained longer than necessary to enforce this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a county or city has established an automated traffic safety camera program as authorized under this section, the compensation paid to the manufacturer or vendor of the equipment used must be based only upon the value of the equipment and services provided or rendered in support of the system and may not be based upon a portion of the fine or civil penalty imposed or the revenue generated by the equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A county or a city may only use revenue generated by an automated traffic safety camera program as authorized under this section for traffic safety purposes including, but not limited to, projects designed to implement the complete streets approach as defined in RCW 47.04.010, changes in physical infrastructure to reduce speeds through road design, changes to improve safety for active transportation users, improve access and safety for road users with mobility, sight, or other disabilities, or the cost to administer, install, operate, and maintain the automated traffic safety cameras, including the cost of processing infractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The automated traffic safety camera program revenue used by a county or city for traffic safety purposes must include the use of revenue in overburdened communities identified under chapter 70A.02 RCW in the county or city that, at a minimum, is proportionate to the share of the population of the county or city who are residents of these communities. This share must be directed to investments that provide direct and meaningful benefits to vulnerable populations within the boundaries of overburdened communities. Revenue used to administer, install, operate, and maintain automated traffic safety cameras, including the cost of processing infractions, are excluded from determination of the proportionate share of revenues under this subsection (13)(b).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county or city may adopt the use of an online ability-to-pay calculator to process and grant requests for reduced fines or reduced civil penalties for automated traffic safety camera violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registered owners of vehicles who receive notices of infraction for automated traffic safety cameras and are recipients of public assistance under Title 74 RCW or participants in the Washington women, infants, and children program, and who request reduced penalties for infractions detected through the use of automated traffic safety camera violations, must be granted reduced penalty amounts of 25 percent of what would otherwise be assessed. Registered owners of vehicles who receive notices of infraction must be provided with information on their eligibility and the opportunity to apply for a reduction in penalty amounts through the mail or internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infractions detected through the use of automated traffic safety cameras are not part of the registered owner's driving record under RCW 46.52.101 and 46.52.120. Additionally, infractions generated by the use of automated traffic safety cameras under this section must be processed in the same manner as parking infractions, including for the purposes of RCW 3.50.100, 35.20.220, 46.16A.120, and 46.20.270(2). The amount of the fine issued for an infraction generated through the use of an automated traffic safety camera may not exceed the amount of a fine issued for other parking infractions within the jurisdiction. However, the amount of the fine issued for a traffic control signal violation detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera may not exceed the monetary penalty for a violation of RCW 46.61.050 as provided under RCW 46.63.110, including all applicable statutory assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the penalty amounts for automated traffic safety camera infractions authorized in subsection (15) of this section, automated traffic safety camera infraction penalties must also include the fee specified in RCW 46.63.110(7)(c) to be deposited in the traumatic brain injury account created in RCW 74.31.060. This fee is waived for registered owners of vehicles granted the penalty reduction specified in subsection (15) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental car business, the law enforcement agency must, before a notice of infraction being issued under this section, provide a written notice to the rental car business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business if the rental car business does not, within 18 days of receiving the written notice, provide to the issuing agency by return mail:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A statement under oath stating the name and known mailing address of the individual driving or renting the vehicle when the infraction occurred; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement under oath that the business is unable to determine who was driving or renting the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred because the vehicle was stolen at the time of the infraction. A statement provided under this subsection must be accompanied by a copy of a filed police report regarding the vehicle theft; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lieu of identifying the vehicle operator, the rental car business may pay the applicable penalty. Timely mailing of this statement to the issuing law enforcement agency relieves a rental car business of any liability under this chapter for the notice of infraction.</p>
