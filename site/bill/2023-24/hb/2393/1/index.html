<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to support the eliminate aviation gasoline lead emissions initiative led by the environmental protection agency and the federal aviation administration through incentivizing the adoption of lead-free aviation fuel alternatives. The environmental protection agency has found that lead emissions from certain aircraft engines cause or contribute to lead air pollution that may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health, and Washington state has a critical interest in ensuring that alternatives to such fuels are broadly available and utilized by the aviation community. In compliance with the clean air act, federal agencies, aviation experts, engineers, and chemists have worked tirelessly to develop alternative lead-free aviation fuel that can be safely utilized by standard piston powered airplanes. The result of this coordinated effort was successful development of an alternative lead-free fuel, yet commercial availability and widespread adoption of this alternative lead-free fuel remains a challenge. The legislature intends to incentivize the widespread adoption of lead-free aviation fuel through providing various excise tax exemptions for both businesses and consumers who utilize these safer alternatives.</p>
