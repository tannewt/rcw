<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like other states around the country, there is a child care workforce crisis in Washington state. High school students who already provide child care for young siblings and neighbors should be able to turn that experience into a rewarding career in an in-demand field. As we expand access to high quality child care in Washington, the opportunities in the child care industry will continue to increase. Therefore, the legislature intends to grow and support the pipeline of child care workers and nurture the development of new child care providers.</p>
