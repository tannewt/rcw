# HB 1615 - Education savings accounts

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1615.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The state Constitution makes clear that it is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex. The legislature finds the state does not provide for the education of children outside of the public school system. The legislature recognizes that the state has fallen short on its mandate to all children in this state.

2. The legislature also recognizes the power entrusted to parents to know what is best for their children. Parents can choose to place their student in a common school, charter public school, or private school or provide home-based instruction. However, not all parents have access to every option for their student. Public charter schools are limited in number and space, while home school and private school options require a large investment from families. The legislature intends to put students first and empower families by decreasing these barriers.

3. While the legislature has spent years increasing funding to the public school system, the legislature finds many students have been left behind. National test scores have been trending down over the last decade and, after extensive school closures, state test scores are down to the lowest they have been since administration of the smarter balanced assessment began. Over 62 percent of Washington's students did not meet grade level standards in math and about half did not meet grade level standards in English.

4. The legislature further finds the effects from the school closures disproportionately impacted students with the most need, specifically those from underrepresented communities. Students with disabilities who were eligible for special education services were delayed in getting their needed supports for too long. Since the 2018-19 school year, there has been an over four percent increase in private school students and over 49 percent increase in students receiving home-based instruction. The legislature finds that families are not satisfied with the education their students are receiving.

5. Therefore, the legislature intends to allow the money invested in students to indeed follow the student by establishing the students first program. The legislature intends to fund education savings accounts for students with priority given to students eligible for special education services, low-income students, and students in failing schools. Parents who apply for the students first program on behalf of their students must agree to only use the funds for education-related expenses. The legislature intends to make the funds accessible with the use of a debit card managed by the state with oversight capability. Students eligible for special education services will qualify for additional support. This program will empower parents to do what is best for their student regardless of income level or zip code, while also meeting the state's moral and constitutional obligation to put students first.
