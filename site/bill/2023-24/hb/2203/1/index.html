</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall coordinate this pilot project with the services offered to veterans by the department of social and health services, local mental health organizations, veteran-focused nonprofit organizations, and the federal department of veterans affairs to minimize duplication and assist those veterans most in need of support to avoid homelessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall report to the legislature by November 1, 2025, and every year thereafter until the expiration of the pilot project, on the number of veterans assisted by the project, the number of veterans eligible for the project but unable to participate, and the number of housing subsidies and reentry subsidies provided.</p>
