<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the 29 federally recognized Indian tribes with territory inside the state of Washington have a shared interest with the state in public safety, and that continued and expanded cooperation with tribal justice systems will promote that interest. The legislature also recognizes that tribes have, for decades, agreed by treaty and through practice not to shelter or conceal those individuals who violate state law and to surrender them to the state for prosecution. In the interests of public safety and partnership, it is therefore the intent of the legislature to create uniform processes by which the state may consistently reciprocate with tribes the return of those individuals who violate tribal law and seek to avoid tribal justice systems by leaving tribal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The legislature further recognizes it is a constitutional imperative that individuals alleged to have violated criminal laws are afforded the fullest protections of due process including, but not limited to: (1) The right to effective assistance of counsel at least equal to that guaranteed by the United States Constitution; (2) the right of an indigent defendant to the assistance of a licensed defense attorney, at the expense of the tribal government; (3) the right to a criminal proceeding presided over by a judge who is licensed to practice law and has sufficient legal training; (4) the right to have access, prior to being charged, to the tribe's criminal laws, rules of evidence, and rules of criminal procedure; and (5) the right to a record of the criminal proceeding, including an audio or other recording of the trial proceeding. The legislature finds that numerous federally recognized tribes with territory inside the state have systems and processes recognized by the federal government as providing due process to defendants at least equal to those required by the United States Constitution. The legislature also finds that all defendants in tribal courts have the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
<p>The legislature additionally recognizes the importance of establishing clear statutory duties when directing peace officers of this state to effectuate new aspects of their work. It is the intent of the legislature that this act set forth procedures by which peace officers and correctional staff of this state must recognize and effectuate tribal arrest warrants.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature declares the purpose of this act is to expand cross jurisdictional cooperation so that fugitives from tribal courts cannot evade justice by remaining off reservation in Washington's counties and cities, while ensuring that defendants receive the fullest due process protections.</p>

<li>
<p>The attorney general or prosecuting attorney shall submit all applicable documents specified in section 4 of this act to a superior court judge in this state along with a motion for an order of surrender. The motion for an order of surrender shall be served upon the person whose extradition is demanded.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The person whose return is demanded may, in the presence of any superior court judge, sign a statement that the person consents to his or her return to the noncertified tribe.

</li>
<li>
<p>Any hearing to test the legality of the extradition request shall occur within three judicial days, excluding weekends and holidays, of the person receiving notice of the motion for an order of surrender. The hearing is limited to determining:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the person has been charged with or convicted of a crime by the noncertified tribe;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the person before the court is the person named in the request for extradition; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If the superior court judge determines that the requirements of subsection (4) of this section and section 4 of this act have been met, the judge shall issue an order of surrender to the noncertified tribe. If the noncertified tribe does not take custody of the person pursuant to the order of surrender on the date the person is scheduled to be released from the place of detention or within 48 hours of the entry of the order of surrender, whichever is later, the person may be released from custody with bail conditioned on the person's appearance before the court at a time specified for his or her surrender to the noncertified tribe or for the vacation of the order of surrender.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>

</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A noncertified tribe that requests extradition pursuant to this act is responsible to arrange the transportation for the tribal fugitive from the place of detention to the tribal court or detention facility.

</li>
<li>
<p>A tribal court representative who is certified as a general authority Washington peace officer under chapter 10.92 RCW, or who is cross-deputized pursuant to chapter 10.93 RCW, may transport a tribal fugitive within the state of Washington pursuant to an order of surrender.</p>

The arrested person must be brought to an appropriate place of detention and then to the nearest available superior court judge without unnecessary delay. The superior court judge shall issue an order continuing custody upon presentation of the tribal arrest warrant.</p>

<li>
<p>The judge shall inform the person appearing under subsection (1) of this section of the name of the noncertified tribe that has subjected the person to an arrest warrant, the basis of the arrest warrant, the right to assistance of counsel, and the right to require a judicial hearing before transfer of custody to the applicable noncertified tribe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After being informed by the judge of the effect of a waiver, the arrested person may waive the right to require a judicial hearing and consent to return to the applicable noncertified tribe by executing a written waiver. If the waiver is executed, the judge shall issue an order to transfer custody under subsection (5) of this section or, with consent of the applicable noncertified tribe, authorize the voluntary return of the person to that tribe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a hearing is not waived under subsection (3) of this section, the court shall hold a hearing within three days, excluding weekends and holidays, after the initial appearance. The arrested person and the prosecuting attorney's office shall be informed of the time and place of the hearing. The court shall release the person upon conditions that will reasonably assure availability of the person for the hearing or direct a peace officer to maintain custody of the person until the time of the hearing. Following the hearing, the judge shall issue an order to transfer custody under subsection (5) of this section unless the arrested person established by clear and convincing evidence that the arrested person is not the person identified in the warrant. If the court does not order transfer of custody, the judge shall order the arrested person to be released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A judicial order to transfer custody issued under subsection (4) of this section shall be directed to a peace officer to take or retain custody of the person until a representative of the applicable noncertified tribe is available to take custody.

If the noncertified tribe has not taken custody within the time specified in the order, the person shall be released. Thereafter, an order to transfer custody may be entered only if a new arrest warrant is issued. The court may authorize the voluntary return of the person with the consent of the applicable noncertified tribe.</p>

<h2 id="section-11">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any arrest warrant issued by the court of a certified tribe shall be accorded full faith and credit by the courts of the state of Washington and enforced by the court and peace officers of the state as if it were the arrest warrant of the state. A Washington state peace officer who arrests a person pursuant to the arrest warrant of a certified tribe, if no other grounds for detention exist under state law, shall, as soon as practical after detaining the person, and in accordance with standard practices, contact the tribal law enforcement agency that issued the warrant to establish the warrant's validity.</p>
