<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that economic inequality continues to widen the gap between the top few earners and working and low-income families, and between white Washingtonians and Washingtonians of color. The 2021 &quot;Labor Market and Economic Report&quot; produced by the Washington state employment security department paints a grim picture: Corporate profits increased by over 500 percent from 2000 to 2021. While everyday Washington residents filed more unemployment claims than ever with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate profits in Washington grew by 23 percent between 2020 and 2021. The average monthly wage for black Washington workers in 2021 was 76.9 percent of what it was for Washington workers generally. Average pay for Asian Pacific Islanders in 2021 was 69.2 percent of the average for Washington workers generally; for Latino or Hispanic workers, the figure was 68.3 percent. In 2021, women workers in Washington made 65.7 percent of men's income. A guaranteed basic income would help Washingtonians struggling under the weight of historical inequities and present-day disparities.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that 22 percent of Washington's adult population has a disability, and more than a quarter of a million of Washington residents have impairments related to mobility, cognition, dressing, and bathing that may prohibit participation in the workforce. A 2021 report generated by the centers for disease control and prevention about disability in Washington state urged that &quot;everyone can play a role in supporting more inclusive state programs to help people with, or at risk for, disabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that certain major life transitions or conditions are associated with high economic instability, including being pregnant or a parent of a young child; experiencing homelessness; being an immigrant, refugee, or asylee; exiting from the foster care system, the juvenile justice system, or the criminal justice system; exiting a relationship or living situation due to domestic violence; or having a disability or behavioral health disorder. These priority populations disproportionately experience poverty.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that climate change will spread disease faster than in the past, creating a new normal where interruption of the labor market, quarantines, and mass-disabling events like those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic become more common place.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature declares that all Washington households deserve basic financial security and that it is the goal of the state to ensure economic sustainability for all families. In 1997, the state legislature created WorkFirst, Washington's temporary assistance for needy families program, to aid the state's struggling families. Then in 2009, it created the working families' tax credit to provide additional assistance to Washington residents and then funded the program in 2021. These measures were taken because direct cash assistance is a proven way to support people and households struggling to cover essential expenses.</p>
<p>The department of social and health services recently completed a basic income feasibility study pointing strongly to the conclusion that Washington residents excluded from social and economic well-being would benefit from a statewide basic income program. The legislature finds that a direct cash assistance program with no restrictions or requirements for how recipients use the funds would help Washington residents struggling under the weight of unprecedented income inequalities.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>No hospital or its medical staff shall adopt or maintain admission practices or policies which result in:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A significant reduction in the proportion of patients who have no third-party coverage and who are unable to pay for hospital services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant reduction in the proportion of individuals admitted for inpatient hospital services for which payment is, or is likely to be, less than the anticipated charges for or costs of such services; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The refusal to admit patients who would be expected to require unusually costly or prolonged treatment for reasons other than those related to the appropriateness of the care available at the hospital.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No hospital shall adopt or maintain practices or policies which would deny access to emergency care based on ability to pay. No hospital which maintains an emergency department shall transfer a patient with an emergency medical condition or who is in active labor unless the transfer is performed at the request of the patient or is due to the limited medical resources of the transferring hospital. Hospitals must follow reasonable procedures in making transfers to other hospitals including confirmation of acceptance of the transfer by the receiving hospital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop definitions by rule, as appropriate, for subsection (1) of this section and, with reference to federal requirements, subsection (2) of this section. The department shall monitor hospital compliance with subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The department shall report individual instances of possible noncompliance to the state attorney general or the appropriate federal agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish and maintain by rule, consistent with the definition of charity care in RCW 70.170.020, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Uniform procedures, data requirements, and criteria for identifying patients receiving charity care; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A definition of residual bad debt including reasonable and uniform standards for collection procedures to be used in efforts to collect the unpaid portions of hospital charges that are the patient's responsibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of providing charity care, each hospital shall develop, implement, and maintain a policy which shall enable indigent persons access to charity care. The policy shall include procedures for identifying patients who may be eligible for health care coverage through medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW or the Washington health benefit exchange and actively assisting patients to apply for any available coverage. If a hospital determines that a patient or their guarantor is qualified for retroactive health care coverage through the medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW, a hospital shall assist the patient or guarantor with applying for such coverage. If a hospital determines that a patient or their guarantor qualifies for retroactive health care coverage through the medical assistance programs under chapter 74.09 RCW, a hospital is not obligated to provide charity care under this section to any patient or their guarantor if the patient or their guarantor fails to make reasonable efforts to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to assist them in applying for such coverage. Hospitals may not impose application procedures for charity care or for assistance with retroactive coverage applications which place an unreasonable burden upon the patient or guarantor, taking into account any physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory deficiencies, or language barriers which may hinder the responsible party's capability of complying with application procedures. It is an unreasonable burden to require a patient to apply for any state or federal program where the patient is obviously or categorically ineligible or has been deemed ineligible in the prior 12 months.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>All patients and their guarantors whose income is not more than 300 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be deemed charity care patients for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges;</p>

<li>
<p>All patients and their guarantors whose income is between 301 and 350 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be entitled to a 75 percent discount for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges, which may be reduced by amounts reasonably related to assets considered pursuant to (c) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All patients and their guarantors whose income is between 351 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, adjusted for family size, shall be entitled to a 50 percent discount for the full amount of the patient responsibility portion of their hospital charges, which may be reduced by amounts reasonably related to assets considered pursuant to (c) of this subsection.</p>

<p>If a hospital considers the existence, availability, and value of assets in order to reduce the discount extended, it must establish and make publicly available a policy on asset considerations and corresponding discount reductions.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) The first $5,000 of monetary assets for an individual or $8,000 of monetary assets for a family of two, and $1,500 of monetary assets for each additional family member.

<p>(F) Any life insurance policy with a face value of $10,000 or less.</p>
<pre><code>    iii. In considering assets, a hospital may not impose procedures which place an unreasonable burden on the responsible party. Information requests from the hospital to the responsible party for the verification of assets shall be limited to that which is reasonably necessary and readily available to substantiate the responsible party's qualification for charity sponsorship and may not be used to discourage application for such sponsorship. Only those facts relevant to eligibility may be verified and duplicate forms of verification may not be demanded.
</code></pre>
<p>(A) In considering monetary assets, one current account statement shall be considered sufficient for a hospital to verify a patient's assets.</p>
<p>(B) In the event that no documentation for an asset is available, a hospital shall rely upon a written and signed statement from the responsible party.</p>
<pre><code>    iv. Asset information obtained by the hospital in evaluating a patient for charity care eligibility shall not be used for collection activities.

v. Nothing in this section prevents a hospital from considering assets as required by the centers for medicare and medicaid services related to medicare cost reporting.
