<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that the current annual regular property tax revenue growth limit of 101 percent is inadequate in addressing the evolving needs of local governments and counties. As populations continue to grow and the costs of goods and services persistently rise, it becomes increasingly challenging for local governments to maintain a stable financial footing.</p>
<p>The legislature, therefore, aims to rectify this situation by increasing the property tax levy limit to more accurately reflect the economic realities of our communities. This act will equip local governments and counties with the necessary tools to keep pace with the rising cost of living.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an increase in levy capacity would provide local governments and counties with greater flexibility to manage their financial resources and meet the needs of their citizens. This increased flexibility will allow them to fund essential services and infrastructure that promote public safety, access to transportation and education, and other services that are vital to the welfare of the citizens of the state.</p>
<p>Many vital fields, such as law enforcement, health care, and education, are facing challenges in recruiting and retaining essential personnel due to the high cost of living in the communities they serve. By empowering local governments to raise the funds needed to support their communities through the balanced approach outlined in this act, the legislature can help them address local needs with minimal impact on taxpayers and retain the essential personnel who serve their communities.</p>
<p>This act represents a clear demonstration of the legislature's commitment to ensuring that all residents have access to essential services they need to thrive, work, and live in the communities they call home.</p>

<p>&quot;Population change&quot; means the annual percent increase in the population of a taxing district between the two most recent years as provided in the official population estimates published by the office of financial management for April 1st of the year before taxes are payable.

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The population change for the city or town within which the taxing district is wholly located;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The population change for the county in which the taxing district is wholly located, when the taxing district is not wholly located within a city or town; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For taxing districts located in more than one county, the county population change for the county in which the greatest total taxable assessed value of the taxing district for the prior assessment year is located.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this subsection (3), the annual percent increase in population is calculated to the nearest tenth of one percent, rounding up to the next tenth of one percent if the second decimal place of the annual percent increase is five or greater.</p>
</li>
