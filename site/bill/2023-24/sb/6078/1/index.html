<ol>
<li>
<p>A state agency may not expend moneys except pursuant to an appropriation by law if the moneys are received in an administrative or judicial regulatory or civil enforcement action, or settlement thereof, brought by the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any regulatory or civil enforcement action brought by the attorney general under the authority of the attorney general or another state agency where moneys are to be paid to the state or to a state-administered account, the attorney general shall seek a court order or settlement that includes a requirement that the moneys received by the state may not be expended except pursuant to an appropriation by law.</p>

However, if such payments to a class of parties include a payment to a state agency, instead of damages, restitution, or refunds, such as payments under the doctrine of cy pres, the expenditure of the payment by the state agency is subject to this section;</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Except as provided in section 1 of this act, the attorney general is authorized to expend from the antitrust revolving fund, created by RCW 43.10.210 through 43.10.220, such funds as are necessary for the payment of costs, expenses and charges incurred in the preparation, institution and maintenance of antitrust actions under the state and federal antitrust acts.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, the conflicting part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict and with respect to the agencies directly affected, and this finding does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act in its application to the agencies concerned. Rules adopted under this act must meet federal requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.</p>
