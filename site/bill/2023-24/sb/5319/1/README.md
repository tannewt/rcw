The company will refund the full amount of any premium paid within 30 days after it receives the returned policy, certificate, or endorsement.

    a. A pet insurer may issue policies that impose waiting periods upon effectuation of the policy that do not exceed 30 days for illnesses or orthopedic conditions not resulting from an accident. Waiting periods for accidents are prohibited. Waiting periods may not be applied to renewals of existing coverage.

    b. A pet insurer utilizing a waiting period permitted in (a) of this subsection shall include a provision in its policy that allows the waiting periods to be waived upon completion of a medical examination. Pet insurers may require the examination to be conducted by a licensed veterinarian after the purchase of the policy.

    c. A medical examination under (b) of this subsection must be paid for by the policyholder, unless the policy specifies that the pet insurer will pay for the examination.

    d. A pet insurer can specify elements to be included as part of the examination and require documentation thereof, provided the specifications do not unreasonably restrict a consumer's ability to waive the waiting periods listed in (a) of this subsection.

3. A pet insurer may not require a veterinary examination of the covered pet for the insured to have their policy renewed.

4. If a pet insurer includes any prescriptive, wellness, or noninsurance benefits in the policy form, then it is made part of the policy contract and must follow all applicable laws and regulations in the insurance code.

    b. The costs of the wellness program must be separate and identifiable from any pet insurance policy sold by either a pet insurer, an insurance producer, or both;

    c. The terms and conditions for the wellness program must be separate from any pet insurance policy sold by either a pet insurer, an insurance producer, or both;

    d. The products or coverages available through the wellness program may not duplicate products or coverages available through the pet insurance policy;

        i. That wellness programs are not insurance; and

        ii. The address and customer service telephone number of either the pet insurer or the insurance producer of record, or both.

3. Coverages included in the pet insurance policy contract described as "wellness" benefits are insurance.

4. If any wellness program undertakes to indemnify another or pay a specified amount upon determinable contingencies, it is transacting in the business of insurance and is subject to the insurance code. This definition is not intended to classify a contract directly between a service provider and a pet owner that only involves the two parties as being the business of insurance unless other indications of insurance also exist.
