<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that 6PPD is a chemical commonly used in motor vehicle tires to keep them flexible and prevent them from degrading quickly. 6PPD works by moving to the surface of the tire and forming a film that protects the tire. As the film breaks down, it produces 6PPD-quinone. When it rains, tire particles containing 6PPD-quinone are washed into streams, rivers, and other water bodies through stormwater runoff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that 6PPD-quinone is directly linked to urban runoff mortality syndrome, a condition where Coho salmon die prior to spawning. 6PPD-quinone is known to be toxic to aquatic species and is the primary causal toxicant for Coho salmon. In June 2023, the department of ecology identified 6PPD as a draft priority chemical under safer products for Washington, cycle 2. Additionally, 6PPD has been identified as a hazardous substance under the model toxics control act and as a chemical of concern for sensitive populations and sensitive species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds it important to reduce sources and uses of 6PPD in Washington to protect aquatic life, particularly salmon. Since 6PPD is ubiquitous in motorized vehicle tires, the legislature intends to identify 6PPD as a priority chemical and certain motorized vehicle tires containing 6PPD as priority consumer products under safer products for Washington.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the regulatory process established in this chapter, a motorized vehicle tire containing 6PPD that is equipped on or intended to be installed as a replacement tire on a motorized vehicle for on-highway use is a priority consumer product. For these priority products, the department must determine regulatory actions and adopt rules to implement those regulatory determinations consistent with the process established in RCW 70A.350.040 and 70A.350.050. In determining regulatory actions under this section, the department must specifically consider the effect of the regulatory actions on driver and passenger safety.</p>
