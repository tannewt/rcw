<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that 6PPD is a chemical commonly used in motor vehicle tires to keep them flexible and prevent them from degrading quickly. 6PPD works by moving to the surface of the tire and forming a film that protects the tire. As the film breaks down, it produces 6PPD-quinone. When it rains, tire particles containing 6PPD-quinone are washed into streams, rivers, and other water bodies through stormwater runoff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that 6PPD-quinone is directly linked to urban runoff mortality syndrome, a condition where Coho salmon die prior to spawning. 6PPD-quinone is known to be toxic to aquatic species and is the primary causal toxicant for Coho salmon. In June 2023, the department of ecology identified 6PPD as a draft priority chemical under safer products for Washington, cycle 2. Additionally, 6PPD has been identified as a hazardous substance under the model toxics control act and as a chemical of concern for sensitive populations and sensitive species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds it important to reduce sources and uses of 6PPD in Washington to protect aquatic life, particularly salmon. Since 6PPD is ubiquitous in motorized vehicle tires, the legislature intends to expedite the safer products for Washington process regarding such tires containing 6PPD.</p>
