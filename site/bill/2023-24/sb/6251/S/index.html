<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Behavioral health administrative services organizations shall use their authorities under RCW 71.24.045 to establish coordination within the behavioral health crisis response system in each regional service area including, but not limited to, establishing comprehensive protocols for dispatching mobile rapid response crisis teams and community-based crisis teams. In furtherance of this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The behavioral health administrative services organization shall convene regional behavioral health crisis response system partners and stakeholders in regions where the behavioral health administrative services organization determines it is of practical value for the purpose of establishing clear regional protocols which memorialize expectations, understandings, lines of communication, and strategies for optimizing crisis response in the regional service area within available resources. The regional protocols must describe how crisis response partners will share information consistent with data-sharing requirements under RCW 71.24.890, which should promote real-time information sharing between 988 contact hubs, regional crisis lines, or their successors, to create a seamless delivery system that is person-centered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A behavioral health administrative services organization may recommend the 988 contact hub or hubs which it determines to be the best fit for partnership in its regional service area among candidates which are able to meet necessary state and federal certification requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 988 contact hub or hubs recommended by the behavioral health administrative services organization in each regional service area must be able to collectively provide the full panoply of culturally appropriate behavioral health crisis response services established under this chapter. New hubs may be certified by the department only when the hubs are needed to fulfill an articulated need identified in the coordinated behavioral health crisis response protocols established by the behavioral health administrative services organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall certify additional 988 contact hubs which are able to meet state and federal certification requirements upon recommendation from a behavioral health administrative services organization and consistent with the need identified in the coordinated regional behavioral health crisis response system protocols;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department and the authority shall provide support to the behavioral health administrative services organization in the development of protocols under subsection (1) of this section as requested by the behavioral health administrative services organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protocols established under subsection (1) of this section must be in writing and copies shall be provided to the department, authority, and state 911 coordination office. The protocol for each regional service area which creates one should be updated as needed and at intervals of no longer than three years; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, partners and stakeholders in the coordinated regional behavioral health crisis response system include but are not limited to regional crisis lines, 988 contact hubs, certified public safety telecommunicators, local governments, tribal governments, first responders, co-response teams, hospitals, and behavioral health agencies.</p>
