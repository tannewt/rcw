<p>The court may initiate a proceeding to impose a remedial sanction on its own motion or on the motion of a person aggrieved by a contempt of court in the proceeding to which the contempt is related. Except as provided in RCW 7.21.050, the court, after notice and hearing, may impose a remedial sanction authorized by this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds that the person has failed or refused to perform an act that is yet within the person's power to perform, the court may find the person in contempt of court and impose one or more of the following remedial sanctions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Imprisonment if the contempt of court is of a type defined in RCW 7.21.010(1) (b) through (d). The imprisonment may extend only so long as it serves a coercive purpose.</p>

<li>
<p>A forfeiture not to exceed two thousand dollars for each day the contempt of court continues, except as provided in (f)(ii) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order designed to ensure compliance with a prior order of the court.</p>

<p>(A) Consider, on the record, the mitigating and aggravating factors used to determine the appropriateness of detention for enforcement of its order;</p>
<p>(B) Enter written findings affirming that it considered all less restrictive options, that detention is the only appropriate alternative, including its rationale and the clear, cogent, and convincing evidence used to enforce the order;</p>
<p>(C) Afford the same due process considerations that it affords all youth in criminal contempt proceedings; and</p>

f. In contempt proceedings initiated for nonpayment of support pursuant to chapter 26.09 or 26.26A RCW:

    i. An adjustment of the order for support, without requiring a petition to modify a child support order, to add a provision that the division of child support will collect any arrearage and any future amounts due; or

<p>If an obligor fails to comply with a support or maintenance order, a petition or motion may be filed without notice under RCW 26.18.040 to initiate a contempt action as provided in chapter 7.21 RCW. If the court finds there is reasonable cause to believe the obligor has failed to comply with a support or maintenance order, the court may issue an order to show cause requiring the obligor to appear at a certain time and place for a hearing, at which time the obligor may appear to show cause why the relief requested should not be granted. A copy of the petition or motion shall be served on the obligor along with the order to show cause.</p>

<p>Service of the order to show cause shall be by personal service, or in the manner provided in the civil rules of superior court or applicable statute.</p>

<li>
<p>There is a rebuttable presumption that an obligor has the means to comply with the support or maintenance order. If the obligor contends at the hearing that he or she lacked the means to comply with the support or maintenance order, the obligor must establish by clear and convincing evidence that he or she exercised due diligence in seeking employment, in conserving assets, or otherwise in rendering himself or herself able to comply with the court's order.</p>

<p>As used in this subsection, &quot;good cause not to require immediate income withholding&quot; is any reason that the court finds appropriate.</p>
<pre><code>b. The superior court may order immediate or delayed income withholding as follows:

    i. Immediate income withholding may be ordered if the person required to pay support has earnings. If immediate income withholding is ordered under this subsection, all support payments shall be paid to the Washington state support registry. The superior court shall issue a mandatory wage assignment order as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW when the support order is signed by the court. The payee under the order or the person entitled to receive the transfer payment is responsible for serving the employer with the order and for its enforcement as set forth in chapter 26.18 RCW.

    ii. If immediate income withholding is not ordered, the court shall require that income withholding be delayed until a payment is past due. The support order shall contain a statement that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits, and liens enforced against real and personal property under the child support statutes of this or any other state, without further notice to the person required to pay support, after a payment is past due.

c.

All administrative orders shall also state that any privilege of the person required to pay support to obtain and maintain a license, as defined in RCW 74.20A.320, may not be renewed, or may be suspended if the person is not in compliance with a support order as provided in RCW 74.20A.320. All administrative orders shall also state that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits, and liens enforced against real and personal property under the child support statutes of this or any other state without further notice to the person required to pay support at any time after entry of the order, unless:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>One of the parties demonstrates, and the presiding officer finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parties reach a written agreement that is approved by the presiding officer that provides for an alternate agreement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the support order does not include the provision ordering and directing that all payments be made to the Washington state support registry and a statement that withholding action may be taken against wages, earnings, assets, or benefits if a support payment is past due or at any time after the entry of the order, or that licensing privileges of the person required to pay support may not be renewed, or may be suspended, the division of child support may serve a notice on the person stating such requirements and authorizations. Service may be by personal service or any form of mail requiring a return receipt.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A provision requiring both the person required to pay support, and the payee under the order or the person entitled to receive support who is a parent of the child or children covered by the order, to keep the Washington state support registry informed of whether he or she has access to health care coverage at reasonable cost and, if so, the health care coverage information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That either or both the person required to pay support, and the payee under the order or the person entitled to receive support who is a parent of the child or children covered by the order, shall be obligated to provide medical support for a child or children covered by the order through health care coverage if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The person obligated to provide medical support provides accessible coverage for the child or children through private or public health care coverage; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coverage that can be extended to cover the child or children is or becomes available to the person obligated to provide medical support through employment or is union-related; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the absence of such coverage, through an additional sum certain amount, as that obligated person's monthly payment toward the premium as provided under RCW 26.09.105;</p>
</li>

<p>That a person obligated to provide medical support who is providing health care coverage must notify both the division of child support and the other party to the order when coverage terminates;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>That if proof of health care coverage or proof that the coverage is unavailable is not provided within twenty days, the person seeking enforcement or the department may seek direct enforcement of the coverage through the employer or union of the person required to provide medical support without further notice to the person as provided under chapter 26.18 RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasons for not ordering health care coverage if the order fails to require such coverage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That any privilege of the person required to pay support to obtain and maintain a license, as defined in RCW 74.20A.320, may not be renewed, or may be suspended if the person is not in compliance with a support order as provided in RCW 74.20A.320;</p>

<li>
<p>That parties to administrative support orders shall provide to the state case registry and update as necessary their residential addresses and the address of the employer of the person required to pay support.

The division of child support shall not release this information if the division of child support determines that there is reason to believe that release of the information may result in physical or emotional harm to the party or to the child, or a restraining order or protective order is in effect to protect one party from the other party.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the person required to pay support has been ordered or notified to make payments to the Washington state support registry under this section, that person shall be fully responsible for making all payments to the Washington state support registry and shall be subject to payroll deduction or other income‑withholding action. The person required to pay support shall not be entitled to credit against a support obligation for any payments made to a person or agency other than to the Washington state support registry except as provided under RCW 74.20.101. A civil action may be brought by the person required to pay support to recover payments made to persons or agencies who have received and retained support moneys paid contrary to the provisions of this section.</p>
