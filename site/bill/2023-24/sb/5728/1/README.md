# SB 5728 - Fuels/climate commit. act

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5728.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that emissions from watercraft fuels supplied in Washington that are combusted outside of Washington, and motor vehicle fuel or special fuel that is used exclusively for agricultural purposes by a farm fuel user, are exempt from coverage under chapter 70A.65 RCW, commonly known as the Washington climate commitment act. However, the legislature further finds that the intended effect of these exemptions may not be reflected in the prices end users are paying for these exempt fuels due to the compliance obligation imposed by the Washington climate commitment act. The legislature determines that it is in the public interest to develop a process to ensure that end users of exempt fuels in Washington's essential maritime and agriculture sectors will not experience price impacts caused by the Washington climate commitment act, and that it is appropriate to reimburse exempt fuel users for fuel costs they have borne under the Washington climate commitment act.

## Section 2
(1) It is the intent of the legislature that each year the total investments made through the carbon emissions reduction account created in RCW 70A.65.240, the climate commitment account created in RCW 70A.65.260, the natural climate solutions account created in RCW 70A.65.270, the air quality and health disparities improvement account created in RCW 70A.65.280, the climate transit programs account created in RCW 46.68.500, and the climate active transportation account created in RCW 46.68.490, achieve the following:

## Section 3
1. The climate commitment account is created in the state treasury. The account must receive moneys distributed to the account from the climate investment account created in RCW 70A.65.250.

    c. Programs, activities, or projects that reduce and mitigate impacts from greenhouse gases and copollutants in overburdened communities, including strengthening the air quality monitoring network to measure, track, and better understand air pollution levels and trends and to inform the analysis, monitoring, and pollution reduction measures required in RCW 70A.65.020;

    d. Programs, activities, or projects that deploy renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind power, and projects to deploy distributed generation, energy storage, demand-side technologies and strategies, and other grid modernization projects;

    e. Programs, activities, or projects that increase the energy efficiency or reduce greenhouse gas emissions of industrial facilities including, but not limited to, proposals to implement combined heat and power, district energy, or on-site renewables, such as solar and wind power, to upgrade the energy efficiency of existing equipment, to reduce process emissions, and to switch to less emissions intensive fuel sources;

    f. Programs, activities, or projects that achieve energy efficiency or emissions reductions in the agricultural sector including:

        i. Fertilizer management;

        ii. Soil management;

        iii. Bioenergy;

        iv. Biofuels;

    vi. Grants, loans, or any financial incentives to food processors to implement projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions;

    vii. Renewable energy projects;

    viii. Farmworker housing weatherization programs;

    h. Programs, activities, or projects that promote the electrification and decarbonization of new and existing buildings, including residential, commercial, and industrial buildings;

    i. Programs, activities, or projects that improve energy efficiency, including district energy, and investments in market transformation of high efficiency electric appliances and equipment for space and water heating;

    j. Clean energy transition and assistance programs, activities, or projects that assist affected workers or people with lower incomes during the transition to a clean energy economy, or grow and expand clean manufacturing capacity in communities across Washington state including, but not limited to:

        i. Programs, activities, or projects that directly improve energy affordability and reduce the energy burden of people with lower incomes, as well as the higher transportation fuel burden of rural residents, such as bill assistance, energy efficiency, and weatherization programs;

        ii. Community renewable energy projects that allow qualifying participants to own or receive the benefits of those projects at reduced or no cost;

        iii. Programs, activities, or other worker-support projects for bargaining unit and nonsupervisory fossil fuel workers who are affected by the transition away from fossil fuels to a clean energy economy. Worker support may include, but is not limited to: (A) Full wage replacement, health benefits, and pension contributions for every worker within five years of retirement; (B) full wage replacement, health benefits, and pension contributions for every worker with at least one year of service for each year of service up to five years of service; (C) wage insurance for up to five years for workers reemployed who have more than five years of service; (D) up to two years of retraining costs, including tuition and related costs, based on in-state community and technical college costs; (E) peer counseling services during transition; (F) employment placement services, prioritizing employment in the clean energy sector; and (G) relocation expenses;
