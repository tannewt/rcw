# SB 5464 - Electronics repair

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5464.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Consumer access to affordable and reliable digital electronic equipment is essential to overcome digital inequities in Washington state and that broader distribution of the information and tools necessary to repair digital electronic equipment will shorten repair times, lengthen the useful lives of electronic equipment, and lower costs for consumers.

    b. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the increased and ongoing need for access to digital electronic equipment as consumers increasingly rely on these products to conduct personal and professional business daily.

    c. The need for more accessible and affordable repair options is felt more acutely among specific sectors of the population, notably Washington residents in rural areas and people who earn low incomes. Original manufacturer shops or authorized repair providers are often located in urban areas requiring consumers to travel long distances for repair or being without equipment for periods of time.

    d. Small, independent businesses play a vital role in Washington's economy. Providing access to information, parts, and tools is essential in contributing to a competitive repair market, allowing small repair shop employees to repair equipment more safely.

    e. Certain electronic equipment are comprised of precious metals that are finite and unnecessary early disposal can be avoided with greater accessibility to proper and affordable repair.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends to broaden access to the information and tools necessary to repair digital electronic equipment in a safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable manner, thereby increasing access to appropriate and affordable digital electronic equipment, supporting small businesses and jobs, and making it easier for all residents of Washington state to connect digitally.
