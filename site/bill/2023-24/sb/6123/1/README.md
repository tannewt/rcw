## Section 1
1.

By the 2018-19 school year, the minimum state allocation for salaries for certificated instructional staff in the basic education program must be increased to provide a statewide average allocation of $64,000 adjusted for inflation from the 2017-18 school year.

2. By the 2018-19 school year, the minimum state allocation for salaries for certificated administrative staff in the basic education program must be increased to provide a statewide average allocation of $95,000 adjusted for inflation from the 2017-18 school year.

3. [Empty]

    a. Beginning with the 2024-25 school year, the minimum state allocation for salaries for classified administrative staff in the basic education program must be increased to provide a statewide average allocation of $91,733 adjusted by inflation from the 2023-24 school year.  Beginning with the 2024-25 school year, the minimum state allocation for salaries for other classified staff in the basic education program must be increased to provide a statewide average allocation of $54,633 adjusted by inflation from the 2023-24 school year.

    b. For the purposes of this subsection, classified administrative staff includes directors or supervisors or other school administrators that are not certificated administrative staff, including staff working in the business office, human resources, public relations, instruction supervision, and maintenance and operations supervision. Other classified staff includes all other noncertificated positions including all other office, clerical, or support personnel.

4. Beginning with the 2018-19 school year, state allocations for salaries for certificated instructional staff, certificated administrative staff, and classified staff must be adjusted for regional differences in the cost of hiring staff. Adjustments for regional differences must be specified in the omnibus appropriations act for each school year through at least school year 2022-23. For school years 2018-19 through school year 2022-23, the school district regionalization factors are based on the median single-family residential value of each school district and proximate school district median single-family residential value as described in RCW 28A.150.412.

5. Beginning with the 2023-24 school year and every four years thereafter, the minimum state salary allocations and school district regionalization factors for certificated instructional staff, certificated administrative staff, classified administrative staff, and classified staff must be reviewed and rebased, as provided under RCW 28A.150.412, to ensure that state salary allocations continue to align with staffing costs for the state's program of basic education.

6. For the purposes of this section, "inflation" has the meaning provided in RCW 28A.400.205 for "inflationary adjustment index."
