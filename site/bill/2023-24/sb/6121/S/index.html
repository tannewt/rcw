<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the use of distributed, small-scale portable flame cap kilns for silvicultural and agricultural management of natural vegetation is consistent with the sustainable agriculture goals of the climate commitment act under RCW 70A.65.260, the sustainable farms and fields grant program identified in RCW 89.08.615, the use of fire in controlled burns to eliminate sources of fuel identified in RCW 76.04.167(3), and the forest restoration goals identified in RCW 70A.65.270. Therefore, the legislature finds that the use of distributed portable flame cap kilns is a necessary component of an integrated land management strategy that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reduces greenhouse gas emissions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produces durable biogenic carbon storage, either in situ or for distribution elsewhere; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimizes air quality impacts from open burning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
