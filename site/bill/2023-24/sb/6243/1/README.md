## Section 2
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 1, chapter . . ., Laws of 2024 (section 1 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, improve industry competitiveness, and create jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a), (b), and (c).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide broad state-level support to the clean technology sector and supplement federal incentives, including potential federal funding through the Pacific Northwest's designation as a hydrogen hub.

4. To measure the effectiveness of the tax preference in this act, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate the first eight years of available data, reporting its findings to the legislature by December 31, 2033. The review must include evaluation of:

    a. The average construction wages for eligible projects;

    b. The number of jobs created in the clean technology sector;

    c. The use of apprenticeship programs, and women, minority, or veteran-owned businesses by eligible projects;

    d. The degree to which the preference encouraged manufacturing and component production for technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions;

    e. Whether facilities benefiting from the tax preference would have been developed without the tax preference; and

    f. Any other relevant metric.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.
