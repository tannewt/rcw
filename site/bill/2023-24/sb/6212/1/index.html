<ol type="a">

<li>
<p>Any other consumer reporting agency so long as the consumer reporting agency resells or otherwise furnishes rental payment information to a nationwide consumer reporting agency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>No duty is created under this section requiring any landlord to report any late or missed rent payments.</p>

<p>A statement that the landlord's duty to report applies only to rent payments which are made on time, and that the landlord has no duty to report late or missed payments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that the tenant's decision to have the tenant's rental payment information reported pursuant to this section is voluntary, and that the tenant may request that the landlord cease reporting this information at any time, for any reason, by providing written notice to the landlord that the tenant no longer wishes to have the tenant's rental payment information reported;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statement that the reporting will commence within 30 days after the first on-time rent payment made following the tenant's request to have the tenant's rental payment information reported under this section, and will continue until the tenant provides written notice to the landlord that the tenant no longer wishes to have the tenant's information reported, or the lease is terminated, whichever happens sooner; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A section affirmatively asking if the tenant wishes to begin having the tenant's rental payment information reported pursuant to this section beginning at the start of the rental agreement or lease in connection with which the information was provided.

<p>A landlord's duty to report on-time rental payments under this section terminates at the end of a current rental agreement or lease, or when a rental agreement or lease reverts by default to a tenancy month-to-month without explicit oral or written agreement of the landlord and tenant prior to the expiration of the rental agreement or lease immediately preceding the tenancy month-to-month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a rental agreement or lease reverts by default to a tenancy month-to-month, if a tenant wishes that the rental payment information be reported pursuant to this section, the tenant must submit a request as set forth in subsection (5) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a tenant engaged in a tenancy month-to-month submits a request under subsection (5) of this section, the landlord shall continue reporting the tenant's rental payment information in conformity with this section until the landlord receives notice from the tenant of the tenant's intent to end such tenancy pursuant to RCW 59.18.200(1)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a tenant requests that the tenant's on-time rental payment information be reported pursuant to this section, a landlord must keep records sufficient to demonstrate, upon request, that the landlord has fulfilled the duties created under this section.
