    b. If the total amount of credit applied for by all applicants in any year exceeds the limit in this subsection, the department must ratably reduce the amount of credit allowed for all applicants so that the limit in this subsection is not exceeded.

## Section 611
(1) The transportation carbon emissions reduction account is created in the state treasury. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.
