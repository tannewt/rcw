[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6176.pdf)

## Section 1
When issuing payments to injured parties, claimants, or other members of the public as a result of funds awarded by a court to the state or allocated in a settlement, due to a regulatory or civil enforcement action to which the state is a party:

1. Payments may only be made to compensate injured parties or claimants, or in the case of actions where injured parties are considered a class with no specific claimants, and multiple payments may be issued, the payments must be issued as grants to appropriate nonprofit organizations supporting disadvantaged parties injured under the enforcement action; and

2. Payments may only be addressed as from the name of the state agency or the administrator of the payments. In any case, a payment as described under this section, including the envelope, any enclosed communication, the check or other payment remittance, may not include the name of any elected official.
