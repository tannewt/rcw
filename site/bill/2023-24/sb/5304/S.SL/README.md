## Section 1
The legislature declares that quality, competent interpretive services for limited English-speaking Washingtonians is a vital public policy priority.

Therefore, the legislature intends to require that interpreters be able to pass both written and oral certification exams to ensure quality, competent services for all Washingtonians.

The department shall assure that sufficient resources are available to assist applicants and recipients in a timely fashion with understanding, responding to, and complying with the requirements of all such written communications.
