    a. A county subject to the review and evaluation requirements of RCW 36.70A.215 must, in consultation with its cities, provide for the annual collection of data on the progress they have achieved in closing the gap between estimated existing housing units within the county and existing housing needs. The data collected must include:

        i. An analysis of the estimated existing housing units and existing housing needs within the county at the following income levels: 0–30 percent of the area median income, 30–50 percent of the area median income, 50–80 percent of the area median income, 80–100 percent of the area median income, 100–120 percent of the area median income, and greater than 120 percent of the area median income; and

        ii. The county's progress in meeting emergency housing, emergency shelters, and permanent supportive housing needs within the district.

    b. A county subject to the requirements of this section and RCW 36.70A.130(5)(a) must report the annual data collected to the department no later than June 30, 2026, and each year thereafter.

    c. A county subject to the requirements of this section and RCW 36.70A.130(5)(b) must report the annual data collected to the department no later than one calendar year after their comprehensive plan periodic update, and each year thereafter.

    d. Should a county find that the gap between estimated existing housing units and existing housing needs has not decreased from the preceding year, the county, in consultation with its cities, must limit units built for 750 percent of area median income. A jurisdiction may limit units built through a moratorium or other legislative action.

2. By July 1, 2027, and each year thereafter, the department shall publish an annual report which includes a summary of the data collected by each county as required under this section, including:

    a. The estimated existing housing units and existing housing needs at the following income levels: 0–30 percent of the area median income, 30–50 percent of the area median income, 50–80 percent of the area median income, 80–100 percent of the area median income, 100–120 percent of the area median income, and greater than 120 percent of the area median income; and

    b. The progress in meeting emergency housing, emergency shelters, and permanent supportive housing needs within a district.

3. A county or city subject to the requirements of this section is eligible to receive funds under chapter 43.155 RCW to defray infrastructure and clean water costs related to infill development and any other increase in affordable housing units.

## Section 2
1. To qualify for financial assistance under this chapter the board must determine that a local government meets all of the following conditions:

    a. The city or county must be imposing a tax under chapter 82.46 RCW at a rate of at least one-quarter of one percent;

    b. The local government must have developed a capital facility plan; and

    c. The local government must be using all local revenue sources which are reasonably available for funding public works, taking into consideration local employment and economic factors.

2. Except where necessary to address a public health need or substantial environmental degradation, a county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may not receive financial assistance under this chapter unless it has adopted a comprehensive plan, including a capital facilities plan element, and development regulations as required by RCW 36.70A.040. This subsection does not require any county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040 to adopt a comprehensive plan or development regulations before requesting or receiving financial assistance under this chapter if such request is made before the expiration of the time periods specified in RCW 36.70A.040. A county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040 that has not adopted a comprehensive plan and development regulations within the time periods specified in RCW 36.70A.040 may apply for and receive financial assistance under this chapter if the comprehensive plan and development regulations are adopted as required by RCW 36.70A.040 before executing a contractual agreement for financial assistance with the board.

3. In considering awarding financial assistance for public facilities to special districts requesting funding for a proposed facility located in a county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040, the board must consider whether the county, city, or town planning under RCW 36.70A.040 in whose planning jurisdiction the proposed facility is located has adopted a comprehensive plan and development regulations as required by RCW 36.70A.040.

10. For projects involving repair, replacement, or improvement of a wastewater treatment plant or other public works facility for which an investment grade efficiency audit is reasonably obtainable, the public works board must require as a contract condition that the project sponsor undertake an investment grade efficiency audit. The project sponsor may finance the costs of the audit as part of its public works assistance account program loan or grant.
