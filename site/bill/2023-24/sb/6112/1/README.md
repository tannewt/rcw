[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6112.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that according to the United States department of agriculture, food waste in the United States is estimated at between 30 to 40 percent of the food supply. The legislature further finds that 30 percent of food in grocery stores is thrown away, according to the recycle track system, creating endless, unfortunate, and unnecessary food waste. The legislature further finds that some food retailers have made significant inroads to donate a significant amount of products that go unsold but remain fit to be enjoyed to local food recovery organizations; however, additional state support is required to further bolster food recovery efforts. It is the intent of the legislature to provide a state funding mechanism to further promote food recovery efforts by food retailers.

A credit earned during one calendar year may be carried over to be credited against taxes incurred in the subsequent calendar year, but may not be carried over a second year.

## Section 3
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference in section 2 of this act. The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage the donation of food items to food banks by food retailers.

4. To measure the effectiveness of the tax credit provided in section 2 of this act, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate the year-to-year change in the number of taxpayers claiming the tax credit under section 2 of this act and the year-to-year change in the amount of credit claimed by taxpayers. The legislature intends to extend the tax credit under section 2 of this act if the total value of qualified donation items, as defined in section 2 of this act, has increased over the period of evaluation.
