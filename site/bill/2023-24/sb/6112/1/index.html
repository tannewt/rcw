<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that according to the United States department of agriculture, food waste in the United States is estimated at between 30 to 40 percent of the food supply. The legislature further finds that 30 percent of food in grocery stores is thrown away, according to the recycle track system, creating endless, unfortunate, and unnecessary food waste. The legislature further finds that some food retailers have made significant inroads to donate a significant amount of products that go unsold but remain fit to be enjoyed to local food recovery organizations; however, additional state support is required to further bolster food recovery efforts. It is the intent of the legislature to provide a state funding mechanism to further promote food recovery efforts by food retailers.</p>
