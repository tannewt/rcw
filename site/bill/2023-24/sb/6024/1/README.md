# SB 6024 - Housing development

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6024.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the state has made groundbreaking investments in state-of-the-art mass transit and intermodal infrastructure. The legislature finds that to maximize the state's return on these investments, land use policies and practices must allow housing development to keep pace with progress being implemented in transportation infrastructure development. The legislature also intends new development to reflect the state's commitment to affordable housing and vibrant, walkable, accessible urban environments that improve health, expand multimodal transportation options, and include varied community facilities, parks, and green spaces that are open to people of all income levels.

The legislature recognizes that cities planning under chapter 36.70A RCW require direction and technical assistance to ensure the benefits of state transportation investments are maximized and shared equitably while avoiding unnecessary programmatic and cost burdens to local governments in their comprehensive planning, code enactment, and permit processing workloads. The legislature further recognizes that regulatory flexibility and local control are also important features of optimal planning outcomes.

## Section 2
1. The department must create a new division within its agency or expand an existing division within its agency and designate a liaison to serve as a point of contact and resource for the department, local governments, and project proponents regarding land use decisions and processing development permit applications. The liaison's priority must be to facilitate and expedite any department decisions required for project approval.

2. The department must adopt any rules necessary to implement this section.

## Section 3
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

## Section 4
1. Cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may not enact or enforce any development regulation within a station area that would prohibit the siting of multifamily residential housing on lots where any other residential use is permissible.

2. [Empty]

    a. Cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 must allow new residential and mixed-use development within any station area at the transit-oriented development density of:

        i. At least 3.5 floor area ratio, on average, within one-half mile walking distance of a stop on a light rail system, a commuter rail stop, or a stop on rail or fixed guideway systems; and

        ii. At least 2.5 floor area ratio, on average, within one-quarter mile walking distance of a stop on a bus rapid transit route.

    b. Cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may not enact or enforce any development regulation that imposes:

        i. A maximum floor area ratio of less than the transit-oriented development density in this subsection for any residential or mixed-use development within a station area; or

        ii. A maximum residential density, measured in residential units per acre or other metric of land area within a station area.

3. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Mixed-use development" means a building with more than 50 percent of the gross floor area dedicated to residential uses.

    b. "Stop" includes any existing stop and any stop funded for development and projected for construction within an applicable six-year transit plan under RCW 35.58.2795. "Stop" does not include a stop used exclusively for bus service, including express bus service operated by a regional transit agency as defined under chapter 81.104 RCW, unless the stop also serves a bus rapid transit route.

4. The department must develop guidance to convert different types of planning measurements to the transit-oriented development density requirements and applicable floor area ratios.

5. Within any station area, any building in which all units are affordable housing for at least 50 years or are dedicated to permanent supportive housing, an additional 1.5 floor area ratio must be permitted. If a city has enacted or expands a program under RCW 36.70A.540 in an area where development regulations must comply with this section, that program, including the amount of affordable housing required either on-site or through an in-lieu payment, governs to the extent it varies from the requirements of this subsection.

6. Any floor area within a building located in a station area that is reserved for residential units in multifamily housing that includes at least three bedrooms must not be counted toward applicable floor area ratio limits. A city may require the residential units to comply with affordability requirements to be eligible for an exclusion from the applicable floor area ratio limits.

7. Cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may by ordinance designate parts of a station area in which to enact or enforce floor area ratios for residential or mixed-use development that are more or less than the applicable transit-oriented development density, if the average maximum floor area ratio of all residential and mixed-use areas within a station area is no less than the applicable transit-oriented development density.

8. At least 10 percent of all residential units in buildings constructed within a station area must be maintained as affordable housing for at least 50 years, unless:

    a. The building is constructed on a lot in which a density that meets or exceeds the transit-oriented development density in subsection (2) of this section was authorized prior to January 1, 2024;

    b. The building is subject to affordability requirements with a lower income threshold or a greater amount of required affordable housing that were enacted by a city prior to January 1, 2024; or

    c. A city has enacted or expands a mandatory program under RCW 36.70A.540 that requires a minimum amount of affordable housing that must be provided by residential development, either on-site or through an in-lieu payment as allowed by RCW 36.70A.540, in an area where development regulations must comply with this section. Such mandatory program may be enacted, modified, or expanded by a city in coordination with adopting regulations to comply with this act, and may require an amount of affordable housing that differs or exceeds the amount required. An optional program established under RCW 36.70A.540 does not meet the requirements of this subsection (8)(c).

9. [Empty]

    a. No later than the deadlines established in subsection (14) of this section, cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 must act to modify or repeal any existing development regulations applicable in a station area that, alone or in combination, are inconsistent with this section.

    b. After the effective date of this section, cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may not enact any development regulations applicable in a station area that, alone or in combination with other development regulations, are inconsistent with this section.

    c. This subsection (9) does not apply to development regulations that are generally applicable health and safety standards, including building code standards and fire and life safety standards.

10. Any city subject to the requirements of this section may apply to the department for planning grants and consult with the department for purposes of obtaining technical assistance and compliance review with development regulation adoption, pursuant to RCW 36.70A.500(7).

11. Nothing in this section requires alteration, displacement, or limitation of industrial or agricultural uses or industrial or agricultural areas within the urban growth area.

12. Nothing in this section requires a city to issue a building permit if other federal, state, and local requirements for a building permit are not met.

13. Cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may exclude from the requirements in this section any lot or portion of a lot that:

    a. Is designated as a shoreline environment governed by a shoreline master program or as a critical area governed by a critical area ordinance;

    b. Is nonconforming with development regulations governing lot dimensions including, but not limited to, standards related to lot width, area, geometry, or street access, unless an applicant demonstrates that the nonconforming lot may be developed in compliance with the development regulations governing lot dimensions by obtaining any modification, deviation, variance, or similar code departure approval allowed under the development regulations;

    c. Contains a designated landmark or is located within a historic district established under a local preservation ordinance adopted prior to the effective date of this section;

    d. Has been designated as containing urban separators by countywide planning policies as of the effective date of this section; or

    e. Is an industrial or agricultural designated lot that either is limited to one dwelling unit per lot or only allows housing for individuals and their families responsible for caretaking, farm work, security, or maintenance.

14. [Empty]

    a. Any city that is required to review its comprehensive plan by December 31, 2024, as specified in RCW 36.70A.130(5)(a), must comply with the requirements of this section no later than its first implementation progress report due after December 31, 2024, and thereafter at each comprehensive plan update or implementation progress report following the completion or funding of any transit stop that would create a new station area within the jurisdiction.

    b. Any city that is required to review its comprehensive plan after December 31, 2024, as specified in RCW 36.70A.130(5) (b), (c), or (d), must comply with the requirements of this section no later than six months after its first comprehensive plan update due after December 31, 2024, and thereafter at each comprehensive plan update or implementation progress report following the completion or funding of any transit stop that would create a new station area within the jurisdiction.

    c. A federally recognized Indian tribe may voluntarily choose to participate in the planning process to implement the requirements of this section in accordance with RCW 36.70A.040(8).

2. If a project permit application within a station area, as defined in RCW 36.70B.020, does not provide parking in compliance with this section, the proposed absence of parking may not be treated as a basis for issuance of a determination of significance pursuant to chapter 43.21C RCW.

3. The parking provisions of this section do not apply:

    a. If a local government submits to the department an empirical study prepared by a credentialed transportation or land use planning expert that clearly demonstrates, and the department finds and certifies, that the application of the parking limitations under subsection (1) of this section will be significantly less safe for automobile drivers or passengers, pedestrians, or bicyclists than if the jurisdiction's parking requirements were applied to the same location. The department must develop guidance to assist cities and counties on items to include in the study; or

    b. To portions of cities within a one-mile radius of a commercial airport in Washington with at least 9,000,000 annual enplanements.

4. If a residential or mixed-use development provides parking for residential uses in excess of what is required in subsection (1) of this section, cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may enact or enforce development regulations to:

    a. Require a share of any provided residential parking to be distributed between units designated as affordable housing and units offered at market rate; and

    b. Include all or a portion of the cost of unbundled parking charges into the monthly cost for rental units designated as affordable housing.

## Section 8
1. The purpose of this section is to accommodate infill and housing development and thereby realize the goals and policies of comprehensive plans adopted according to chapter 36.70A RCW.

2. A city or county planning under RCW 36.70A.040 is authorized by this section to establish categorical exemptions from the requirements of this chapter. An exemption may be adopted by a city or county under this subsection if it meets the following criteria:

    a. It categorically exempts government action related to development proposed to fill in an urban growth area, designated according to RCW 36.70A.110, where current density and intensity of use in the area is roughly equal to or lower than called for in the goals and policies of the applicable comprehensive plan and the development is either:

        i. Residential development;

        ii. Mixed-use development; or

        iii. Commercial development up to 65,000 square feet, excluding retail development;

    b. It does not exempt government action related to development that is inconsistent with the applicable comprehensive plan or would clearly exceed the density or intensity of use called for in the goals and policies of the applicable comprehensive plan;

    c. The local government considers the specific probable adverse environmental impacts of the proposed action and determines that these specific impacts are adequately addressed by the development regulations or other applicable requirements of the comprehensive plan, subarea plan element of the comprehensive plan, planned action ordinance, or other local, state, or federal rules or laws; and

    d. [Empty]

        i. The city or county's applicable comprehensive plan was previously subjected to environmental analysis through an environmental impact statement under the requirements of this chapter prior to adoption; or

        ii. The city or county has prepared an environmental impact statement that considers the proposed use or density and intensity of use in the area proposed for an exemption under this section.

3. All project actions that propose to develop one or more residential housing units within the incorporated areas in an urban growth area designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110 or middle housing within the unincorporated areas in an urban growth area designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110, and that meet the criteria identified in (a) and (b) of this subsection, are categorically exempt from the requirements of this chapter. For purposes of this section, "middle housing" has the same meaning as in RCW 36.70A.030 as amended by chapter 332, Laws of 2023. Jurisdictions shall satisfy the following criteria prior to the adoption of the categorical exemption under this subsection (3):

    a. The city or county shall find that the proposed development is consistent with all development regulations implementing an applicable comprehensive plan adopted according to chapter 36.70A RCW by the jurisdiction in which the development is proposed, with the exception of any development regulation that is inconsistent with applicable provisions of chapter 36.70A RCW; and

    b. The city or county has prepared environmental analysis that considers the proposed use or density and intensity of use in the area proposed for an exemption under this section and analyzes multimodal transportation impacts, including impacts to neighboring jurisdictions, transit facilities, and the state transportation system.

        i. Such environmental analysis shall include documentation that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation for impacts to elements of the environment have been adequately addressed for the development exempted. The requirements may be addressed in locally adopted comprehensive plans, subarea plans, adopted development regulations, other applicable local ordinances and regulations, or applicable state and federal regulations. The city or county must document its consultation with the department of transportation on impacts to state-owned transportation facilities including consideration of whether mitigation is necessary for impacts to transportation facilities.

        ii. Before finalizing the environmental analysis pursuant to (b)(i) of this subsection (3), the city or county shall provide a minimum of 60 days' notice to affected tribes, relevant state agencies, other jurisdictions that may be impacted, and the public. If a city or county identifies that mitigation measures are necessary to address specific probable adverse impacts, the city or county must address those impacts by requiring mitigation identified in the environmental analysis pursuant to this subsection (3)(b) through locally adopted comprehensive plans, subarea plans, development regulations, or other applicable local ordinances and regulations. Mitigation measures shall be detailed in an associated environmental determination.

        iii. The categorical exemption is effective 30 days following action by a city or county pursuant to (b)(ii) of this subsection (3).

4. Until September 30, 2025, all project actions that propose to develop one or more residential housing or middle housing units within a city west of the crest of the Cascade mountains with a population of 700,000 or more are categorically exempt from the requirements of this chapter. After September 30, 2025, project actions that propose to develop one or more residential housing or middle housing units within the city may utilize the categorical exemption in subsection (3) of this section.

5. All project actions that propose to develop residential or mixed-use development within any station area up to the transit-oriented development density required under section 4 of this act are categorically exempt from the requirements of this chapter.

6. Any categorical exemption adopted by a city or county under this section applies even if it differs from the categorical exemptions adopted by rule of the department under RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a). Nothing in this section shall invalidate categorical exemptions or environmental review procedures adopted by a city or county under a planned action pursuant to RCW 43.21C.440. However, any categorical exemption adopted by a city or county under this section shall be subject to the rules of the department adopted according to RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a) that provide exceptions to the use of categorical exemptions adopted by the department.
