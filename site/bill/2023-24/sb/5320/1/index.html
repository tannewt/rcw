After this initial period, a person may take the specialty examination. If the person passes the examination, the person may work unsupervised for the balance of the minimum hours required for certification. A person may not be certified as a specialty electrician in the appliance repair specialty or in a specialty other than the designated specialties in (d)(i) of this subsection, however, until the person has worked a minimum of 2,000 hours in that specialty, or longer if set by rule by the department;</p>

The applicant shall obtain the additional two years of work experience required in industrial or commercial electrical installation prior to the beginning, or after the completion, of the technical school program.

</li>
<li>
<p>The department must determine whether hours of training and experience in the armed services or school program are in the electrical construction trade and appropriate as a substitute for hours of work experience. The department must use the following criteria for evaluating the equivalence of classroom electrical training programs and work in the electrical construction trade:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A two-year electrical training program must consist of 3,000 or more hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a two-year electrical training program, a minimum of 2,400 hours of student/instructor contact time must be technical electrical instruction directly related to the scope of work of the electrical specialty. Student/instructor contact time includes lecture and in-school lab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may not allow credit for a program that accepts more than 1,000 hours transferred from another school's program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electrical specialty training school programs of less than two years will have all of the above student/instructor contact time hours proportionately reduced. Such programs may not apply to more than fifty percent of the work experience required to attain certification.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electrical training programs of less than two years may not be credited towards qualification for journey level electrician unless the training program is used to gain qualification for a 4,000 hour electrical specialty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No other requirement for eligibility may be imposed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall establish reasonable rules for the examinations to be given applicants for certificates of competency. In establishing the rules, the department shall consult with the board. Upon determination that the applicant is eligible to take the examination, the department shall so notify the applicant, indicating instructions for taking the examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No noncertified individual may work unsupervised more than one year beyond the date when the trainee would be eligible to test for a certificate of competency if working on a full-time basis after original application for the trainee certificate. For the purposes of this section, &quot;full-time basis&quot; means 2,000 hours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
