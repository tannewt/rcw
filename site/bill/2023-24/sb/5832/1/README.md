## Section 1
The legislature finds that corporations and other for-profit business entities with partial foreign ownership spend money to influence state and local elections in Washington and around the country. The explicit or implicit influence of major foreign investors subjects corporate decision making to foreign influence as executives consider interests of foreign investors. Furthermore, investors are the ultimate beneficiaries of corporate interests. Where part of the shareholders' equity is attributable to foreign investors, spending corporate treasury funds on elections in the state of Washington means spending the equity of foreign entities on elections in the state of Washington. Finally, corporations and similar for-profit business entities have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders or other investors, including investors around the world, and generally prioritize the interests of such investors, which may diverge substantially from the interests of the people of Washington and the United States. The United States securities and exchange commission, major capital investors, corporate managers, and corporate governance experts broadly agree that ownership or control of one percent or more of shares can confer substantial influence on corporate decision making. For similar reasons, ownership or control of five percent or more of shares by multiple foreign investors can affect corporate decision making.

The legislature further finds that current law does not adequately protect against foreign interference through corporate political spending by United States corporations with significant foreign ownership. Corporations and similar business entities with partial foreign ownership regularly spend millions of dollars on elections in the state of Washington. This political spending by foreign-influenced corporations threatens democratic self-government. Therefore, to protect the integrity of the state's democratic self-government, it is necessary to prevent foreign-influenced business entities from influencing elections through political spending.
