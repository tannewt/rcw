<h2 id="section-101">Section 101 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-101">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the climate commitment act, which established a cap and invest program under chapter 70A.65 RCW, makes Washington state a leader in climate policy and, through the codification of carbon offset projects, creates a new way for revenue to be generated from lands and waters in the state while advancing the state's greenhouse gas emissions policies. Carbon offset projects established for this program must primarily benefit the people of Washington by being located on Washington lands and waters to the extent possible, rather than outside the state. In addition to this program, there are emerging carbon offset markets, both regulatory and voluntary, in which land managing state agencies and local governments may obtain financial benefits through management agreements that increase carbon sequestration, also helping to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate disruption. The legislature further finds that the department of ecology should provide technical assistance to state agencies and local governments seeking to sponsor carbon offset credit projects on their lands in a manner that will meet the climate commitment act requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of this act to authorize the department of ecology to provide technical assistance to any state agency or local government seeking to sponsor carbon offset projects that will qualify as offset credits under the climate commitment act. Further, it is the intent of this act to provide the department of natural resources with specific authority, procedures, and criteria for development and implementation of carbon storage projects and associated ecosystem services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department must establish a program to provide assistance to any state agency or local government seeking to develop an offset program relating to lands managed by the agency or local government. The assistance may include, but is not limited to, funding or technical assistance to assess a project's technical feasibility, investment requirements, development and operational costs, expected returns, administrative and legal hurdles, and project risks and pitfalls.</p>
