<p>&quot;Family assessment&quot; means a comprehensive assessment of child safety, risk of subsequent child abuse or neglect, and family strengths and needs that is applied to a child abuse or neglect report.

<li>
<p>&quot;Family assessment response&quot; means a way of responding to certain reports of child abuse or neglect made under this chapter using a differential response approach to child protective services.

<li>
<p>&quot;Negligent treatment or maltreatment&quot; means an act or a failure to act, or the cumulative effects of a pattern of conduct, behavior, or inaction, that evidences a serious disregard of consequences of such magnitude as to constitute a clear and present danger to a child's health, welfare, or safety, including but not limited to conduct prohibited under RCW 9A.42.100. When considering whether a clear and present danger exists, evidence of a parent's substance abuse as a contributing factor to negligent treatment or maltreatment shall be given great weight. The fact that siblings share a bedroom is not, in and of itself, negligent treatment or maltreatment. Poverty, experiencing homelessness, or exposure to domestic violence as defined in RCW 7.105.010 that is perpetrated against someone other than the child does not constitute negligent treatment or maltreatment in and of itself.</p>

<li>
<p>The department, upon receiving a report of an incident of alleged abuse or neglect pursuant to this chapter, involving a child who has died or has had physical injury or injuries inflicted upon him or her other than by accidental means or who has been subjected to alleged sexual abuse, shall report such incident to the proper law enforcement agency, including military law enforcement, if appropriate.

<p>Any case referred to the department by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW on the basis of an expert medical opinion that child abuse, neglect, or sexual assault has occurred and that the child's safety will be seriously endangered if returned home, the department shall file a dependency petition unless a second licensed physician of the parents' choice believes that such expert medical opinion is incorrect. If the parents fail to designate a second physician, the department may make the selection. If a physician finds that a child has suffered abuse or neglect but that such abuse or neglect does not constitute imminent danger to the child's health or safety, and the department agrees with the physician's assessment, the child may be left in the parents' home while the department proceeds with reasonable efforts to remedy parenting deficiencies.</p>

<p>The department believes there is a serious threat of substantial harm to the child;</p>

<li>
<p>The report indicates conduct involving a criminal offense that has, or is about to occur, in which the child is the victim; or</p>

<p>Provide voluntary services to families based on the results of the initial family assessment. If a family refuses voluntary services, and the department cannot identify specific facts related to risk or safety that warrant assignment to investigation under this chapter, and there is not a history of reports of child abuse or neglect related to the family, then the department must close the family assessment response case. However, if at any time the department identifies risk or safety factors that warrant an investigation under this chapter, then the family assessment response case must be reassigned to investigation;</p>

<p>In conducting an investigation or family assessment of alleged abuse or neglect, the department or law enforcement agency:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>May interview children. If the department determines that the response to the allegation will be family assessment response, the preferred practice is to request a parent's, guardian's, or custodian's permission to interview the child before conducting the child interview unless doing so would compromise the safety of the child or the integrity of the assessment. The interviews may be conducted on school premises, at day-care facilities, at the child's home, or at other suitable locations outside of the presence of parents. If the allegation is investigated, parental notification of the interview must occur at the earliest possible point in the investigation that will not jeopardize the safety or protection of the child or the course of the investigation. Prior to commencing the interview the department or law enforcement agency shall determine whether the child wishes a third party to be present for the interview and, if so, shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the child's wishes. Unless the child objects, the department or law enforcement agency shall make reasonable efforts to include a third party in any interview so long as the presence of the third party will not jeopardize the course of the investigation; and</p>

<p>There exists an action known as a petition for a protection order. The following types of petitions for a protection order may be filed:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A petition for a domestic violence protection order, which must allege the existence of domestic violence committed against the petitioner or petitioners by an intimate partner or a family or household member. The petitioner may petition for relief on behalf of himself or herself and on behalf of family or household members who are minors or vulnerable adults. A petition for a domestic violence protection order must specify whether the petitioner and the respondent are intimate partners or family or household members. A petitioner who has been sexually assaulted or stalked by an intimate partner or a family or household member should, but is not required to, seek a domestic violence protection order, rather than a sexual assault protection order or a stalking protection order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition for a sexual assault protection order, which must allege the existence of nonconsensual sexual conduct , nonconsensual sexual penetration, or sexual abuse that was committed against the petitioner by the respondent. A petitioner who has been sexually assaulted by an intimate partner or a family or household member should, but is not required to, seek a domestic violence protection order, rather than a sexual assault protection order. A single incident of nonconsensual sexual conduct or nonconsensual sexual penetration is sufficient grounds for a petition for a sexual assault protection order. The petitioner may petition for a sexual assault protection order on behalf of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Himself or herself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A minor child, where the petitioner is the parent, legal guardian, or custodian;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vulnerable adult, where the petitioner is an interested person; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other adult for whom the petitioner demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the petitioner is interested in the adult's well-being, the court's intervention is necessary, and the adult cannot file the petition because of age, disability, health, or inaccessibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition for a stalking protection order, which must allege the existence of stalking committed against the petitioner or petitioners by the respondent. A petitioner who has been stalked by an intimate partner or a family or household member should, but is not required to, seek a domestic violence protection order, rather than a stalking protection order. The petitioner may petition for a stalking protection order on behalf of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Himself or herself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A minor child, where the petitioner is the parent, legal guardian, or custodian;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vulnerable adult, where the petitioner is an interested person; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other adult for whom the petitioner demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the petitioner is interested in the adult's well-being, the court's intervention is necessary, and the adult cannot file the petition because of age, disability, health, or inaccessibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition for a vulnerable adult protection order, which must allege that the petitioner, or person on whose behalf the petition is brought, is a vulnerable adult and that the petitioner, or person on whose behalf the petition is brought, has been abandoned, abused, financially exploited, or neglected, or is threatened with abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect, by the respondent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition for an extreme risk protection order, which must allege that the respondent poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others by having in the respondent's custody or control, purchasing, possessing, accessing, receiving, or attempting to purchase or receive, a firearm. The petition must also identify information the petitioner is able to provide about the firearms, such as the number, types, and locations of any firearms the petitioner believes to be in the respondent's current ownership, possession, custody, access, or control. A petition for an extreme risk protection order may be filed by (i) an intimate partner or a family or household member of the respondent; or (ii) a law enforcement agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition for an antiharassment protection order, which must allege the existence of unlawful harassment committed against the petitioner or petitioners by the respondent. If a petitioner is seeking relief based on domestic violence, nonconsensual sexual conduct, nonconsensual sexual penetration, or stalking, the petitioner may, but is not required to, seek a domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking protection order, rather than an antiharassment order. The petitioner may petition for an antiharassment protection order on behalf of:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Himself or herself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A minor child, where the petitioner is the parent, legal guardian, or custodian;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vulnerable adult, where the petitioner is an interested person; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other adult for whom the petitioner demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the petitioner is interested in the adult's well-being, the court's intervention is necessary, and the adult cannot file the petition because of age, disability, health, or inaccessibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the exception of vulnerable adult protection orders, a person under 18 years of age who is 15 years of age or older may seek relief under this chapter as a petitioner and is not required to seek relief through a petition filed on his or her behalf. He or she may also petition on behalf of a family or household member who is a minor if chosen by the minor and capable of pursuing the minor's stated interest in the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person under 15 years of age who is seeking relief under this chapter is required to seek relief by a person authorized as a petitioner under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a petition for a protection order is filed by an interested person, the affidavit or declaration must also include a statement of why the petitioner qualifies as an interested person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition for any type of protection order must not be dismissed or denied on the basis that the conduct alleged by the petitioner would meet the criteria for the issuance of another type of protection order. If a petition meets the criteria for a different type of protection order other than the one sought by the petitioner, the court shall consider the petitioner's preference, and enter a temporary protection order or set the matter for a hearing as appropriate under the law. The court's decision on the appropriate type of order shall not be premised on alleviating any potential stigma on the respondent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The protection order petition must contain a section where the petitioner, regardless of petition type, may request specific relief provided for in RCW 7.105.310 that the petitioner seeks for himself or herself or for family or household members who are minors. The totality of selected relief, and any other relief the court deems appropriate for the petitioner, or family or household members who are minors, must be considered at the time of entry of temporary protection orders and at the time of entry of full protection orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a court reviewing the petition for a protection order or a request for a temporary protection order determines that the petition was not filed in the correct court, the court shall enter findings establishing the correct court, and direct the clerk to transfer the petition to the correct court and to provide notice of the transfer to all parties who have appeared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon filing a petition for a protection order, the petitioner may request that the court enter an ex parte temporary protection order and an order to surrender and prohibit weapons without notice until a hearing on a full protection order may be held. When requested, there shall be a rebuttable presumption to include the petitioner's minor children as protected parties in the ex parte temporary domestic violence protection order until the full hearing to reduce the risk of harm to children during periods of heightened risk, unless there is good cause not to include the minor children. If the court denies the petitioner's request to include the minor children, the court shall make written findings why the children should not be included, pending the full hearing. An ex parte temporary protection order shall be effective for a fixed period of time and shall be issued initially for a period not to exceed 14 days, which may be extended for good cause.</p>

<p>If the petitioner for an extreme risk protection order is a law enforcement agency, the petitioner shall make a good faith effort to provide notice to an intimate partner or family or household member of the respondent and to any known third party who may be at risk of violence. The notice must state that the petitioner intends to petition the court for an extreme risk protection order or has already done so, and include referrals to appropriate resources, including behavioral health, domestic violence, and counseling resources. The petitioner must attest in the petition to having provided such notice, or attest to the steps that will be taken to provide such notice.</p>

<p>The following provisions apply to the renewal of all full protection orders issued under this chapter, with the exception of the renewal of extreme risk protection orders.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the court grants a protection order for a fixed time period, the petitioner may file a motion to renew the order at any time within the 90 days before the order expires. The motion for renewal must state the reasons the petitioner seeks to renew the protection order. Upon receipt of a motion for renewal, the court shall order a hearing, which must be not later than 14 days from the date of the order. Service must be made on the respondent not less than five judicial days before the hearing, as provided in RCW 7.105.150.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the motion for renewal is uncontested and the petitioner seeks no modification of the order, the order may be renewed on the basis of the petitioner's motion and statement of the reason for the requested renewal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petitioner bears no burden of proving that he or she has a current reasonable fear of harm by the respondent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall grant the motion for renewal unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a substantial change in circumstances and the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For a domestic violence protection order, that the respondent proves that the respondent will not resume acts of domestic violence against the petitioner or the petitioner's family or household members who are minors or vulnerable adults when the order expires;</p>

<li>
<p>For an antiharassment protection order, that the respondent proves that the respondent will not resume harassment of the petitioner when the order expires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may consider the following unweighted factors, and no inference is to be drawn from the order in which the factors are listed:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has committed or threatened sexual assault; sexual abuse; domestic violence; stalking; abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable adult; or other harmful acts against the petitioner or any other person since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has violated the terms of the protection order and the time that has passed since the entry of the order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has exhibited suicidal ideation or attempts since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has been convicted of criminal activity since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has either: Acknowledged responsibility for acts of sexual assault, sexual abuse, domestic violence, or stalking, or acts of abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable adult, or behavior that resulted in the entry of the protection order; or successfully completed state-certified perpetrator treatment or counseling since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has a continuing involvement with drug or alcohol abuse, if such abuse was a factor in the protection order; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors relating to a substantial change in circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall not deny a motion to renew a protection order for any of the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The respondent has not violated the protection order previously issued by the court;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petitioner or the respondent is a minor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petitioner did not report the conduct giving rise to the protection order, or subsequent violations of the protection order, to law enforcement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A no-contact order or a restraining order that restrains the respondent's contact with the petitioner has been issued in a criminal proceeding or in a domestic relations proceeding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relief sought by the petitioner may be available in a different action or proceeding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The passage of time since the last incident of conduct giving rise to the issuance of the protection order; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The respondent no longer lives near the petitioner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The terms of the original protection order must not be changed on a motion for renewal unless the petitioner has requested the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may renew the protection order for another fixed time period of no less than one year, or may enter a permanent order as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the protection order includes the parties' children, a renewed protection order may be issued for more than one year, subject to subsequent orders entered in a proceeding under chapter 26.09, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may award court costs, service fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees to the petitioner as provided in RCW 7.105.310.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court declines to renew the protection order, the court shall state, in writing in the order, the particular reasons for the court's denial. If the court declines to renew a protection order that had restrained the respondent from having contact with children protected by the order, the court shall determine on the record whether the respondent and the children should undergo reunification therapy. Any reunification therapy provider should be made aware of the respondent's history of domestic violence and should have training and experience in the dynamics of intimate partner violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances for respondents under the age of 18, or in determining the appropriate duration for an order, the court shall consider the circumstances surrounding the respondent's youth at the time of the initial behavior alleged in the petition for a protection order. The court shall consider developmental factors, including the impact of time of a youth's development, and any information the minor respondent presents about his or her personal progress or change in circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="section-11">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section applies to modification or termination of domestic violence protection orders, sexual assault protection orders, stalking protection orders, and antiharassment protection orders.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon a motion with notice to all parties and after a hearing, the court may modify the terms of an existing protection order or terminate an existing order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A respondent's motion to modify or terminate an existing protection order must include a declaration setting forth facts supporting the requested order for modification or termination. The nonmoving parties to the proceeding may file opposing declarations. All motions to modify or terminate shall be based on the written materials and evidence submitted to the court. The court shall set a hearing only if the court finds that adequate cause is established. If the court finds that the respondent established adequate cause, the court shall set a date for hearing the respondent's motion, which must be at least 14 days from the date the court finds adequate cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the motion of a respondent, the court may not modify or terminate an existing protection order unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a substantial change in circumstances such that the respondent will not resume, engage in, or attempt to engage in, the following acts against the petitioner or those persons protected by the protection order if the order is terminated or modified:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Acts of domestic violence, in cases involving domestic violence protection orders;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Acts of unlawful harassment, in cases involving antiharassment protection orders.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The petitioner bears no burden of proving that he or she has a current reasonable fear of harm by the respondent.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may consider the following unweighted factors, and no inference is to be drawn from the order in which the factors are listed:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has committed or threatened sexual assault, sexual abuse, domestic violence, stalking, or other harmful acts against the petitioner or any other person since the protection order was entered;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has a continuing involvement with drug or alcohol abuse, if such abuse was a factor in the protection order;</p>

<p>Whether the petitioner consents to terminating the protection order, provided that consent is given voluntarily and knowingly; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors relating to a substantial change in circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may not base its determination on the fact that time has passed without a violation of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of whether there is a substantial change in circumstances, the court may decline to terminate a protection order if it finds that the acts of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual abuse, stalking, unlawful harassment, and other harmful acts that resulted in the issuance of the protection order were of such severity that the order should not be terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A respondent may file a motion to modify or terminate an order no more than once in every 12-month period that the order is in effect, starting from the date of the order and continuing through any renewal period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person who is protected by a protection order has a child or adopts a child after a protection order has been issued, but before the protection order has expired, the petitioner may seek to include the new child in the order of protection on an ex parte basis if the child is already in the physical custody of the petitioner. If the restrained person is the legal or biological parent of the child, a hearing must be set and notice given to the restrained person prior to final modification of the full protection order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court may require the respondent to pay the petitioner for costs incurred in responding to a motion to modify or terminate a protection order, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

<p>On motion of the prosecuting attorney in a criminal proceeding, the court may order that a child under the age of 18 may testify in a room outside the presence of the defendant and the jury while one-way closed-circuit television equipment simultaneously projects the child's testimony into another room so the defendant and the jury can watch and hear the child testify if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The testimony will:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Describe an act or attempted act of sexual contact performed with or on the child witness by another person or with or on a child other than the child witness by another person;</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testimony is taken during the criminal proceeding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds by substantial evidence, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, that :</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The particular child involved would be traumatized;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source of the trauma is not the courtroom generally, but the presence of the defendant; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The emotional or mental distress suffered by the child would be more than de minimis, such that the child could not reasonably communicate at the trial. If the defendant is excluded from the presence of the child, the jury must also be excluded;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As provided in (a) and (b) of this subsection, the court may allow a child witness to testify in the presence of the defendant but outside the presence of the jury, via closed-circuit television, if the court finds, upon motion and hearing outside the presence of the jury, that : (i) The particular child involved would be traumatized; (ii) the source of the trauma is not the courtroom generally, but the presence of the jury; and (iii) the emotional or mental distress suffered by the child would be more than de minimis, regardless of whether or not the child could reasonably communicate at the trial in front of the jury. If the child is able to communicate in front of the defendant but not the jury the defendant will remain in the room with the child while the jury is excluded from the room;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds that the prosecutor has made all reasonable efforts to prepare the child witness for testifying, including informing the child or the child's parent or guardian about community counseling services, giving court tours, and explaining the trial process. If the prosecutor fails to demonstrate that preparations were implemented or the prosecutor in good faith attempted to implement them, the court shall deny the motion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court balances the strength of the state's case without the testimony of the child witness against the defendant's constitutional rights and the degree of infringement of the closed-circuit television procedure on those rights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds that no less restrictive method of obtaining the testimony exists that can adequately protect the child witness from suffering emotional or mental distress that would be more than de minimis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the court allows the child witness to testify outside the presence of the defendant, the defendant can communicate constantly with the defense attorney by electronic transmission and be granted reasonable court recesses during the child's testimony for person-to-person consultation with the defense attorney;</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The court can communicate with the attorneys by an audio system so that the court can rule on objections and otherwise control the proceedings;</li>

<p>All parties in the room with the child witness are on camera and can be viewed by all other parties. If viewing all participants is not possible, the court shall describe for the viewers the location of the prosecutor, defense attorney, and other participants in relation to the child;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds that the television equipment is capable of making an accurate reproduction and the operator of the equipment is competent to operate the equipment; and</p>

<li>
<p>The court imposes reasonable guidelines upon the parties for conducting the filming to avoid trauma to the child witness or abuse of the procedure for tactical advantage.</p>

<p>The prosecutor, defense attorney, and a neutral and trained victim's advocate, if any, shall always be in the room where the child witness is testifying.

<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>During the hearing conducted under subsection (1) of this section to determine whether the child witness may testify outside the presence of the defendant and/or the jury, the court may conduct the observation and examination of the child outside the presence of the defendant if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The prosecutor alleges and the court concurs that the child witness will be unable to testify in front of the defendant or that (i) the particular child involved would be traumatized; (ii) the source of the trauma is not the courtroom generally, but the presence of the defendant; and (iii) the emotional or mental distress suffered by the child would be more than de minimis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant can observe and hear the child witness by closed-circuit television;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant can communicate constantly with the defense attorney during the examination of the child witness by electronic transmission and be granted reasonable court recesses during the child's examination for person-to-person consultation with the defense attorney; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds the closed-circuit television is capable of making an accurate reproduction and the operator of the equipment is competent to operate the equipment. Whenever possible, all the parties in the room with the child witness shall be on camera so that the viewers can see all the parties. If viewing all participants is not possible, then the court shall describe for the viewers the location of the prosecutor, defense attorney, and other participants in relation to the child.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall make particularized findings on the record articulating the factors upon which the court based its decision to allow the child witness to testify via closed-circuit television pursuant to this section. The factors the court may consider include, but are not limited to, a consideration of the child's age, physical health, emotional stability, expressions by the child of fear of testifying in open court or in front of the defendant, the relationship of the defendant to the child, and the court's observations of the child's inability to reasonably communicate in front of the defendant or in open court. The court's findings shall identify the impact the factors have upon the child's ability to testify in front of the jury or the defendant or both and the specific nature of the emotional or mental trauma the child would suffer. The court shall determine whether the source of the trauma is the presence of the defendant, the jury, or both, and shall limit the use of the closed-circuit television accordingly.</p>

<p>This section does not apply if the defendant is an attorney pro se unless the defendant has a court-appointed attorney assisting the defendant in the defense.</p>
