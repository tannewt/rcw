# SB 5961 - Residential tenants

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5961.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The state is in the midst of a housing affordability crisis. Homes cannot be built fast enough to meet the urgent need to keep families, seniors, and all Washington renters housed.

    b. Residential rents and manufactured/mobile home lot rents have increased at a rate that outpaces inflation, wage growth, cost of living adjustments for programs like social security, and other standard economic metrics that drive price increases. During a six-month period in 2023, the United States census bureau estimated that more than 900,000 Washington renters experienced a rent increase, of which 75 percent reported an increase of greater than $100 and more than nine percent experienced an increase of more than $500.

    c. Tenants in residential and manufactured/mobile home settings are subject to not only excessive rent increases, but also to the addition of new recurring or periodic fees that can have the effect of drastically increasing monthly housing costs. Tenants also experience arbitrary one-time fees or the addition of fees for services that were previously provided at no cost. Combined with rent increases, these fees create significant additional financial strains for renter households.

    d. According to the 2021 American community survey, nearly one out of every four renters in the state of Washington is over the age of 55. Households of color are disproportionately renters, and these households, as well as Hispanic households, are majority renter households.

    e. Excessive rent increases force renter households, including families, seniors, and young people, to lose housing opportunities. Due to excessive rent increases, renter households are increasingly unable to afford housing in communities of opportunity and are being forced to move away from their communities. Renter households are forced to make tough and often impossible decisions between paying the rent and paying for other basic necessities such as medicine, child care, and transportation. Communities, employers, and workers all suffer when businesses cannot retain or hire staff because workers cannot find affordable rental homes near their jobs and offices, a phenomenon especially common for the service industry in heavy tourism areas.

2. The legislature declares that failure to act urgently to protect Washingtonians from excessive rent increases will result in continued harm for millions of residents, especially when considering the essential nature of housing. Therefore, the legislature intends to enact rent stabilization policies in order to preserve the public peace, health, or safety of the state by providing Washington renters with predictability, transparency, and the same protections afforded to other consumers.

## Section 101
1. Except as authorized by an exemption under section 102 of this act, a landlord may not increase the rent and fees combined for any type of tenancy, regardless of whether the tenancy is month-to-month or for a term greater than month-to-month:

    a. During the first 12 months after the tenancy begins; and

    b. During any 12-month period, in an amount greater than five percent.

2. If a landlord increases the rent and fees combined above the amount allowed in subsection (1) of this section as authorized by an exemption under section 102 of this act, the landlord must include facts supporting any claimed exemptions in the written notice of the rent increase. Notice must comply with this section, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, and be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040.

3. A landlord may not charge a higher rent or fees or include terms of payment or other material conditions in a rental agreement that are more burdensome to a tenant for a month-to-month rental agreement than for a rental agreement where the term is greater than month-to-month, or vice versa.

4. A landlord who engages in practices in violation of this section, section 102 of this act, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, 59.18.170, 59.18.200, 59.18.270, or 59.18.650 is liable for:

    a. Damages in the amount of any excess rent, fees, or other costs paid by the tenant;

    b. Mandatory damages equal to three months of any unlawful rent, fees, or other costs charged by the landlord; and

    c. Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing the action.

5. The remedies provided by this section are in addition to any other remedies provided by law, including the remedies provided for in section 104 of this act.

6. It is a defense to an eviction or other legal action that the action to remove the tenant and recover possession of the premises was for nonpayment of rent or fees that were unlawfully increased in violation of this section.

7. A landlord may not report the tenant to a tenant screening service provider for failure to pay rent or fees that were unlawfully increased in violation of this section.

8. A local government may adopt policies, ordinances, or other regulations to enforce this act.

## Section 102
A landlord may increase rent and fees combined in an amount greater than allowed under section 101 of this act only as authorized by the exemptions described in this section.

1. If the first certificate of occupancy for the dwelling unit was issued 10 or less years before the date of the notice of the rent increase, rent and fee increases for the dwelling unit are not limited by section 101 of this act.

2. For a tenancy in a dwelling unit operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements, rent and fee increases that comply with legally binding and recorded regulatory agreements are not limited by section 101 of this act.

## Section 103
A landlord must provide a tenant with annual notice of rent and fee increases in substantially the following form. Notice under this section must comply with the requirements in RCW 59.18.140 and be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040.

"TO TENANT(S): (tenant name(s))

AT ADDRESS: (tenant address)

RENT AND FEE INCREASE NOTICE TO TENANTS

This notice is required by Washington state law to inform you of your rights regarding rent and fee increases. Washington state limits how much your landlord can raise your rent and fees.

1. Your landlord can raise your rent and fees combined once every 12 months by up to five percent, as allowed by section 101 of this act. Your landlord is not required to raise the rent or fees by any amount.

2. Your landlord may be exempt from the five percent limit on rent and fee increases for the reasons described in section 102 of this act. If your landlord claims an exemption, your landlord is required to include supporting facts with this notice.

3. Your landlord must properly and fully complete the form below to notify you of any rent and fee increases and any exemptions claimed.

Your landlord (name) intends to (check one of the following):

__ Raise your rent and/or fees: Your total rent and fee increase effective (date) will be (percent), which totals an additional $(dollar amount) per month, for a new total amount of $(dollar amount) per month for rent and fees combined.

This rent and/or fee increase is allowed by state law and is (check one of the following):

__ A lower rent and/or fee increase than the maximum allowed by state law.

__ The maximum rent and/or fee increase allowed by state law.

__ Authorized by an exemption under section 102 of this act. If the rent and/or fee increase is authorized by an exemption, your landlord must fill out the section of the form below.

EXEMPTIONS CLAIMED BY LANDLORD

Under penalty of perjury, I (landlord name) certify that I am allowed under Washington state law to raise your rent and fees by (percent), which is more than the maximum increase otherwise allowed by state law, because I am claiming the following exemption under section 102 of this act (check one of the following):

__ The first certificate of occupancy for your dwelling unit was issued on (insert date), which is 10 or less years before the date of this rent and fee increase notice, so the maximum allowable rent and fee increase limit in section 101 of this act does not apply. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)

__ You live in a dwelling unit operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements, so rent and fee increases that comply with legally binding and recorded regulatory agreements are not limited by section 101 of this act. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)"

## Section 104
The legislature finds that the practices covered by section 101 of this act, section 102 of this act, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, 59.18.170, 59.18.200, 59.18.270, and 59.18.650 are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of section 101 of this act, section 102 of this act, section 103 of this act, RCW 59.18.140, 59.18.170, 59.18.200, 59.18.270, or 59.18.650 by a landlord is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

## Section 105
1. The department of commerce shall create an online landlord resource center to distribute information to landlords about available programs and resources including, but not limited to, the following:

    a. The landlord mitigation program created in RCW 43.31.605;

    b. The low-income residential weatherization programs created in chapter 70A.35 RCW;

    c. The model lease provisions regarding rent and fee increases created by the attorney general's office under subsection (2) of this section;

    d. Local government resources; and

    e. Any other programs and resources that the department determines are relevant.

2. [Empty]

    a. The attorney general, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders, shall publish model lease provisions regarding rent and fee increases that comply with the requirements in this chapter.

    b. The model lease provisions regarding rent and fee increases must be published in the top 10 languages spoken in Washington state and, at the discretion of the office of the attorney general, other languages.

    c. The office of the attorney general shall publish the model lease provisions regarding rent and fee increases in the following formats:

        i. A full digital version available on the office of the attorney general's website; and

        ii. Hard copy versions made available upon request to landlords, tenants, and any other relevant entities identified by the office of the attorney general.

    d. The office of the attorney general shall publish the first version of the model lease provisions regarding rent and fee increases by January 1, 2025, and shall periodically publish new versions of the model lease provisions as necessary to incorporate any relevant changes made to this chapter.

## Section 106
1. The tenant shall conform to all reasonable obligations or restrictions, whether denominated by the landlord as rules, rental agreement, rent, or otherwise, concerning the use, occupation, and maintenance of his or her dwelling unit, appurtenances thereto, and the property of which the dwelling unit is a part if such obligations and restrictions are not in violation of any of the terms of this chapter and are not otherwise contrary to law, and if such obligations and restrictions are brought to the attention of the tenant at the time of his or her initial occupancy of the dwelling unit and thus become part of the rental agreement.

2. Except for termination of tenancy and an increase in the amount of rent, after 30 days written notice to each affected tenant, a new rule of tenancy may become effective upon completion of the term of the rental agreement or sooner upon mutual consent.

3. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, a landlord shall provide a minimum of 60 days' prior written notice of an increase in the amount of rent to each affected tenant, and any increase in the amount of rent may not become effective prior to the completion of the term of the rental agreement.

    b. If the rental agreement governs a subsidized tenancy where the amount of rent is based on the income of the tenant or circumstances specific to the subsidized household, a landlord shall provide a minimum of 30 days' prior written notice of an increase in the amount of rent to each affected tenant. An increase in the amount of rent may become effective upon completion of the term of the rental agreement or sooner upon mutual consent.

    c. If a landlord intends to increase the rent and fees combined in an amount of three percent or more, the landlord must provide written notice to each affected tenant a minimum of 180 days before the effective date of the increase. This subsection (3)(c) does not apply to any tenancy in a dwelling unit operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization that qualifies for an exemption under section 102(2) of this act.

## Section 107
1. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this subsection, when premises are rented for an indefinite time, with monthly or other periodic rent reserved, such tenancy shall be construed to be a tenancy from month to month, or from period to period on which rent is payable, and shall end by written notice of 20 days or more, preceding the end of any of the months or periods of tenancy, given by the tenant to the landlord.

    b. Any tenant who is a member of the armed forces, including the national guard and armed forces reserves, or that tenant's spouse or dependent, may end a rental agreement with less than 20 days' written notice if the tenant receives permanent change of station or deployment orders that do not allow a 20-day written notice.

    c. If a landlord provides notice to a tenant that the landlord intends to increase the rent and fees combined in an amount of three percent or more, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement at any time prior to the effective date of the increase by providing the landlord with written notice at least 20 days before terminating the rental agreement. If a tenant terminates a rental agreement under this subsection (1)(c), the tenant only owes pro rata rent through the date upon which the tenant vacates the dwelling unit. A landlord may not charge a tenant any fines or fees for terminating a rental agreement under this subsection (1)(c). This subsection (1)(c) does not apply to any tenancy in a dwelling unit operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization that qualifies for an exemption under section 102(2) of this act.

2. [Empty]

    a. Whenever a landlord plans to change to a policy of excluding children, the landlord shall give a written notice to a tenant at least 90 days before the tenancy ends to effectuate such change in policy. Such 90-day notice shall be in lieu of the notice required by subsection (1) of this section. However, if after giving the 90-day notice the change in policy is delayed, the notice requirements of subsection (1) of this section shall apply unless waived by the tenant.

    b. Whenever a landlord plans to change any apartment or apartments to a condominium form of ownership, the landlord shall provide a written notice to a tenant at least 120 days before the tenancy ends, in compliance with RCW 64.34.440(1), to effectuate such change. The 120-day notice is in lieu of the notice required in subsection (1) of this section. However, if after providing the 120-day notice the change to a condominium form of ownership is delayed, the notice requirements in subsection (1) of this section apply unless waived by the tenant.

    c. [Empty]

        i. Whenever a landlord plans to demolish or substantially rehabilitate premises or plans a change of use of premises, the landlord shall provide a written notice to a tenant at least 120 days before the tenancy ends. This subsection (2)(c)(i) does not apply to jurisdictions that have created a relocation assistance program under RCW 59.18.440 and otherwise provide 120 days' notice.

        ii. For purposes of this subsection (2)(c):

(A) "Assisted housing development" means a multifamily rental housing development that either receives government assistance and is defined as federally assisted housing in RCW 59.28.020, or that receives other federal, state, or local government assistance and is subject to use restrictions.

(B) "Change of use" means: (I) Conversion of any premises from a residential use to a nonresidential use that results in the displacement of an existing tenant; (II) conversion from one type of residential use to another type of residential use that results in the displacement of an existing tenant, such as conversion to a retirement home, emergency shelter, or transient hotel; or (III) conversion following removal of use restrictions from an assisted housing development that results in the displacement of an existing tenant: PROVIDED, That displacement of an existing tenant in order that the owner or a member of the owner's immediate family may occupy the premises does not constitute a change of use.

(C) "Demolish" means the destruction of premises or the relocation of premises to another site that results in the displacement of an existing tenant.

(D) "Substantially rehabilitate" means extensive structural repair or extensive remodeling of premises that requires a permit such as a building, electrical, plumbing, or mechanical permit, and that results in the displacement of an existing tenant.

## Section 108
1. [Empty]

    a. A landlord may not evict a tenant, refuse to continue a tenancy, or end a periodic tenancy except for the causes enumerated in subsection (2) of this section and as otherwise provided in this subsection.

    b. If a landlord and tenant enter into a rental agreement that provides for the tenancy to continue for an indefinite period on a month-to-month or periodic basis after the agreement expires, the landlord may not end the tenancy except for the causes enumerated in subsection (2) of this section; however, a landlord may end such a tenancy at the end of the initial period of the rental agreement without cause only if:

        i. At the inception of the tenancy, the landlord and tenant entered into a rental agreement between six and 12 months; and

        ii. The landlord has provided the tenant before the end of the initial lease period at least 60 days' advance written notice ending the tenancy, served in a manner consistent with RCW 59.12.040.

    c. If a landlord and tenant enter into a rental agreement for a specified period in which the tenancy by the terms of the rental agreement does not continue for an indefinite period on a month-to-month or periodic basis after the end of the specified period, the landlord may end such a tenancy without cause upon expiration of the specified period only if:

        i. At the inception of the tenancy, the landlord and tenant entered into a rental agreement of 12 months or more for a specified period, or the landlord and tenant have continuously and without interruption entered into successive rental agreements of six months or more for a specified period since the inception of the tenancy;

        ii. The landlord has provided the tenant before the end of the specified period at least 60 days' advance written notice that the tenancy will be deemed expired at the end of such specified period, served in a manner consistent with RCW 59.12.040; and

        iii. The tenancy has not been for an indefinite period on a month-to-month or periodic basis at any point since the inception of the tenancy. However, for any tenancy of an indefinite period in existence as of May 10, 2021, if the landlord and tenant enter into a rental agreement between May 10, 2021, and three months following the expiration of the governor's proclamation 20-19.6 or any extensions thereof, the landlord may exercise rights under this subsection (1)(c) as if the rental agreement was entered into at the inception of the tenancy provided that the rental agreement is otherwise in accordance with this subsection (1)(c).

    d. For all other tenancies of a specified period not covered under (b) or (c) of this subsection, and for tenancies of an indefinite period on a month-to-month or periodic basis, a landlord may not end the tenancy except for the causes enumerated in subsection (2) of this section. Upon the end date of the tenancy of a specified period, the tenancy becomes a month-to-month tenancy.

    e. Nothing prohibits a landlord and tenant from entering into subsequent lease agreements that are in compliance with the requirements in subsection (2) of this section.

    f. (i) Except as provided in (f)(ii) of this subsection, a tenant may end a tenancy for a specified time by providing notice in writing not less than 20 days prior to the ending date of the specified time.

        ii. If a landlord provides notice to a tenant that the landlord intends to increase the rent and fees combined in an amount of three percent or more, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement at any time prior to the effective date of the increase by providing the landlord with written notice at least 20 days before terminating the rental agreement. If a tenant terminates a rental agreement under this subsection (1)(f)(ii), the tenant only owes pro rata rent through the date upon which the tenant vacates the dwelling unit. A landlord may not charge a tenant any fines or fees for terminating a rental agreement under this subsection (1)(f)(ii). This subsection (1)(f)(ii) does not apply to any tenancy in a dwelling unit operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization that qualifies for an exemption under section 102(2) of this act.

2. The following reasons listed in this subsection constitute cause pursuant to subsection (1) of this section:

    a. The tenant continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after written notice requiring, in the alternative, the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises has remained uncomplied with for the period set forth in RCW 59.12.030(3) for tenants subject to this chapter. The written notice may be served at any time after the rent becomes due;

    b. The tenant continues in possession after substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, or a tenant obligation imposed by law, other than one for monetary damages, and after the landlord has served written notice specifying the acts or omissions constituting the breach and requiring, in the alternative, that the breach be remedied or the rental agreement will end, and the breach has not been adequately remedied by the date specified in the notice, which date must be at least 10 days after service of the notice;

    c. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least three days' advance written notice to quit after he or she commits or permits waste or nuisance upon the premises, unlawful activity that affects the use and enjoyment of the premises, or other substantial or repeated and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises by the landlord or neighbors of the tenant;

    d. The tenant continues in possession after the landlord of a dwelling unit in good faith seeks possession so that the owner or his or her immediate family may occupy the unit as that person's principal residence and no substantially equivalent unit is vacant and available to house the owner or his or her immediate family in the same building, and the owner has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. There is a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not act in good faith if the owner or immediate family fails to occupy the unit as a principal residence for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 days immediately after the tenant vacated the unit pursuant to a notice to vacate using this subsection (2)(d) as the cause for the lease ending;

    e. The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to sell a single-family residence and the landlord has provided at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. For the purposes of this subsection (2)(e), an owner "elects to sell" when the owner makes reasonable attempts to sell the dwelling within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, including, at a minimum, listing it for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertising it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not intend to sell the unit if:

        i. Within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, the owner does not list the single-family dwelling unit for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertise it for sale at a reasonable price by listing it on the real estate multiple listing service; or

        ii. Within 90 days after the date the tenant vacated or the date the property was listed for sale, whichever is later, the owner withdraws the rental unit from the market, the landlord rents the unit to someone other than the former tenant, or the landlord otherwise indicates that the owner does not intend to sell the unit;

    f. The tenant continues in possession of the premises after the landlord serves the tenant with advance written notice pursuant to RCW 59.18.200(2)(c);

    g. The tenant continues in possession after the owner elects to withdraw the premises to pursue a conversion pursuant to RCW 64.34.440 or 64.90.655;

    h. The tenant continues in possession, after the landlord has provided at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate that: (i) The premises has been certified or condemned as uninhabitable by a local agency charged with the authority to issue such an order; and (ii) continued habitation of the premises would subject the landlord to civil or criminal penalties. However, if the terms of the local agency's order do not allow the landlord to provide at least 30 days' advance written notice, the landlord must provide as much advance written notice as is possible and still comply with the order;

        i. The tenant continues in possession after an owner or lessor, with whom the tenant shares the dwelling unit or access to a common kitchen or bathroom area, has served at least 20 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental term or, if a periodic tenancy, the end of the rental period;

    j. The tenant continues in possession of a dwelling unit in transitional housing after having received at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate in advance of the expiration of the transitional housing program, the tenant has aged out of the transitional housing program, or the tenant has completed an educational or training or service program and is no longer eligible to participate in the transitional housing program. Nothing in this subsection (2)(j) prohibits the ending of a tenancy in transitional housing for any of the other causes specified in this subsection;

    k. The tenant continues in possession of a dwelling unit after the expiration of a rental agreement without signing a proposed new rental agreement proffered by the landlord; provided, that the landlord proffered the proposed new rental agreement at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the current rental agreement and that any new terms and conditions of the proposed new rental agreement are reasonable. This subsection (2)(k) does not apply to tenants whose tenancies are or have become periodic;

    l. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 30 days' advance written notice to vacate due to intentional, knowing, and material misrepresentations or omissions made on the tenant's application at the inception of the tenancy that, had these misrepresentations or omissions not been made, would have resulted in the landlord requesting additional information or taking an adverse action;

    m. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' advance written notice to vacate for other good cause prior to the end of the period or rental agreement and such cause constitutes a legitimate economic or business reason not covered or related to a basis for ending the lease as enumerated under this subsection (2). When the landlord relies on this basis for ending the tenancy, the court may stay any writ of restitution for up to 60 additional days for good cause shown, including difficulty procuring alternative housing. The court must condition such a stay upon the tenant's continued payment of rent during the stay period. Upon granting such a stay, the court must award court costs and fees as allowed under this chapter;

    n. [Empty]

        i. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' written notice to vacate prior to the end of the period or rental agreement and the tenant has committed four or more of the following violations, other than ones for monetary damages, within the preceding 12-month period, the tenant has remedied or cured the violation, and the landlord has provided the tenant a written warning notice at the time of each violation: A substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, a substantial breach of a material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, or a substantial breach of a tenant obligation imposed by law;

        ii. Each written warning notice must:

(A) Specify the violation;

(B) Provide the tenant an opportunity to cure the violation;

(C) State that the landlord may choose to end the tenancy at the end of the rental term if there are four violations within a 12-month period preceding the end of the term; and

(D) State that correcting the fourth or subsequent violation is not a defense to the ending of the lease under this subsection;

        iii. The 60-day notice to vacate must:

(A) State that the rental agreement will end upon the specified ending date for the rental term or upon a designated date not less than 60 days after the delivery of the notice, whichever is later;

(B) Specify the reason for ending the lease and supporting facts; and

(C) Be served to the tenant concurrent with or after the fourth or subsequent written warning notice;

        iv. The notice under this subsection must include all notices supporting the basis of ending the lease;

    v. Any notices asserted under this subsection must pertain to four or more separate incidents or occurrences; and

    vi. This subsection (2)(n) does not absolve a landlord from demonstrating by admissible evidence that the four or more violations constituted breaches under (b) of this subsection at the time of the violation had the tenant not remedied or cured the violation;

    o. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental period or rental agreement if the tenant is required to register as a sex offender during the tenancy, or failed to disclose a requirement to register as a sex offender when required in the rental application or otherwise known to the property owner at the beginning of the tenancy;

    p. The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 20 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental period or rental agreement if the tenant has made unwanted sexual advances or other acts of sexual harassment directed at the property owner, property manager, property employee, or another tenant based on the person's race, gender, or other protected status in violation of any covenant or term in the lease.

3. When a tenant has permanently vacated due to voluntary or involuntary events, other than by the ending of the tenancy by the landlord, a landlord must serve a notice to any remaining occupants who had coresided with the tenant at least six months prior to and up to the time the tenant permanently vacated, requiring the occupants to either apply to become a party to the rental agreement or vacate within 30 days of service of such notice. In processing any application from a remaining occupant under this subsection, the landlord may require the occupant to meet the same screening, background, and financial criteria as would any other prospective tenant to continue the tenancy. If the occupant fails to apply within 30 days of receipt of the notice in this subsection, or the application is denied for failure to meet the criteria, the landlord may commence an unlawful detainer action under this chapter. If an occupant becomes a party to the tenancy pursuant to this subsection, a landlord may not end the tenancy except as provided under subsection (2) of this section. This subsection does not apply to tenants residing in subsidized housing.

4. A landlord who removes a tenant or causes a tenant to be removed from a dwelling in any way in violation of this section is liable to the tenant for wrongful eviction, and the tenant prevailing in such an action is entitled to the greater of their economic and noneconomic damages or three times the monthly rent of the dwelling at issue, and reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.

5. Nothing in subsection (2)(d), (e), or (f) of this section permits a landlord to end a tenancy for a specified period before the completion of the term unless the landlord and the tenant mutually consent, in writing, to ending the tenancy early and the tenant is afforded at least 60 days to vacate.

6. All written notices required under subsection (2) of this section must:

    a. Be served in a manner consistent with RCW 59.12.040; and

    b. Identify the facts and circumstances known and available to the landlord at the time of the issuance of the notice that support the cause or causes with enough specificity so as to enable the tenant to respond and prepare a defense to any incidents alleged. The landlord may present additional facts and circumstances regarding the allegations within the notice if such evidence was unknown or unavailable at the time of the issuance of the notice.

## Section 109
1. If a landlord charges a tenant any move-in fees or security deposits, the move-in fees and security deposits combined may not exceed one month's rent.

2. All moneys paid to the landlord by the tenant as a deposit as security for performance of the tenant's obligations in a lease or rental agreement shall promptly be deposited by the landlord in a trust account, maintained by the landlord for the purpose of holding such security deposits for tenants of the landlord, in a financial institution as defined by RCW 30A.22.041 or licensed escrow agent located in Washington. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the landlord shall be entitled to receipt of interest paid on such trust account deposits. The landlord shall provide the tenant with a written receipt for the deposit and shall provide written notice of the name and address and location of the depository and any subsequent change thereof. If during a tenancy the status of landlord is transferred to another, any sums in the deposit trust account affected by such transfer shall simultaneously be transferred to an equivalent trust account of the successor landlord, and the successor landlord shall promptly notify the tenant of the transfer and of the name, address, and location of the new depository. If, during the tenancy, the tenant's dwelling unit is foreclosed upon and the tenant's deposit is not transferred to the successor after the foreclosure sale or other transfer of the property from the foreclosed-upon owner to a successor, the foreclosed-upon owner shall promptly refund the full deposit to the tenant immediately after the foreclosure sale or transfer. If the foreclosed-upon owner does not either immediately refund the full deposit to the tenant or transfer the deposit to the successor, the foreclosed-upon owner is liable to the tenant for damages up to two times the amount of the deposit. In any action brought by the tenant to recover the deposit, the prevailing party is entitled to recover the costs of suit or arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The tenant's claim to any moneys paid under this section shall be prior to that of any creditor of the landlord, including a trustee in bankruptcy or receiver, even if such moneys are commingled.

## Section 110
1. If at any time during the tenancy the tenant fails to carry out the duties required by RCW 59.18.130 or 59.18.140, the landlord may, in addition to pursuit of remedies otherwise provided by law, give written notice to the tenant of said failure, which notice shall specify the nature of the failure.

2. The landlord may not charge a late fee for rent that is paid within five days following its due date. If rent is more than five days past due, the landlord may charge late fees commencing from the first day after the due date until paid. Late fees may not exceed $10 per month. Nothing in this subsection prohibits a landlord from serving a notice to pay or vacate at any time after the rent becomes due.

3. When late fees may be assessed after rent becomes due, the tenant may propose that the date rent is due in the rental agreement be altered to a different due date of the month. The landlord shall agree to such a proposal if it is submitted in writing and the tenant can demonstrate that his or her primary source of income is a regular, monthly source of governmental assistance that is not received until after the date rent is due in the rental agreement. The proposed rent due date may not be more than five days after the date the rent is due in the rental agreement. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a tenant from making a request for reasonable accommodation under federal, state, or local law.

## Section 201
1. Except as authorized by an exemption under section 202 of this act and as provided in RCW 59.20.060(2)(c), a landlord may not increase the rent and fees combined for any type of tenancy, regardless of whether the tenancy is month-to-month or for a term greater than month-to-month:

    a. During the first 12 months after the tenancy begins; and

    b. During any 12-month period, in an amount greater than five percent.

2. If a landlord increases the rent and fees combined above the amount allowed in subsection (1) of this section as authorized by an exemption under section 202 of this act, the landlord must include facts supporting any claimed exemptions in the written notice of the rent increase. Notice must comply with this section, section 203 of this act, RCW 59.20.090(2), and be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040.

3. A landlord may not charge a higher rent or fees or include terms of payment or other material conditions in a rental agreement that are more burdensome to a tenant for a month-to-month rental agreement than for a rental agreement where the term is greater than month-to-month, or vice versa.

4. A landlord who engages in practices in violation of this section, section 202 of this act, section 203 of this act, RCW 59.20.060, 59.20.090, or 59.20.170 is liable for:

    a. Damages in the amount of any excess rent, fees, or other costs paid by the tenant;

    b. Mandatory damages equal to three months of any unlawful rent, fees, or other costs charged by the landlord; and

    c. Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing the action.

5. The remedies provided by this section are in addition to any other remedies provided by law, including the remedies provided for in section 204 of this act.

6. It is a defense to an eviction or other legal action that the action to remove the tenant and recover possession of the premises was for nonpayment of rent or fees that were unlawfully increased in violation of this section.

7. A landlord may not report a tenant to a tenant screening service provider for failure to pay rent or fees that were unlawfully increased in violation of this section.

8. A local government may adopt policies, ordinances, or other regulations to enforce this act.

## Section 202

1. For a tenancy on a manufactured/mobile home lot operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements, rent and fee increases that comply with legally binding and recorded regulatory agreements are not limited by section 201 of this act.

2. During the first 12 months after the qualified sale of a manufactured/mobile home community to an eligible organization as defined in RCW 59.20.030 whose mission aligns with the long-term preservation and affordability of the manufactured/mobile home community, the eligible organization may increase the annual rent and fees combined for the manufactured/mobile home community in an amount greater than allowed under section 201 of this act as needed to cover the cost of purchasing the manufactured/mobile home community if the increase is approved by vote or agreement with the majority of the manufactured/mobile home owners in the manufactured/mobile home community.

A landlord must provide a tenant with annual notice of rent and fee increases in substantially the following form. Notice under this section must comply with the requirements in RCW 59.20.090(2) and be served in accordance with RCW 59.12.040.

"TO TENANTS: (tenant name(s))

AT ADDRESS: (tenant address)

RENT AND FEE INCREASE NOTICE TO TENANTS

This notice is required by Washington state law to inform you of your rights regarding rent and fee increases. Washington state limits how much your landlord can raise your rent and fees.

1. Your landlord can raise your rent and fees combined once every 12 months by up to five percent, as allowed by section 201 of this act. Your landlord is not required to raise the rent or fees by any amount.

2. Your landlord may be exempt from the five percent limit on rent and fee increases for the reasons described in section 202 of this act. If your landlord claims an exemption, your landlord is required to include supporting facts with this notice.

3. Your landlord must properly and fully complete the form below to notify you of any rent and fee increases and any exemptions claimed.

Your landlord (name) intends to (check one of the following):

__ Raise your rent and/or fees: Your total rent and fee increase effective (date) will be (percent), which totals an additional $(dollar amount) per month, for a new total amount of $(dollar amount) per month for rent and fees combined.

This rent and/or fee increase is allowed by state law and is (check one of the following):

__ A lower rent and/or fee increase than the maximum allowed by state law.

__ The maximum rent and/or fee increase allowed by state law.

__ Authorized by an exemption under section 202 of this act. If the rent and/or fee increase is authorized by an exemption, your landlord must fill out the section of the form below.

EXEMPTIONS CLAIMED BY LANDLORD

Under penalty of perjury, I (landlord name) certify that I am allowed under Washington state law to raise your rent and fees by (percent), which is more than the maximum increase otherwise allowed by state law, because I am claiming the following exemption under section 202 of this act (check one of the following):

__ You live on a manufactured/mobile home lot operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization where maximum rents are regulated by other laws or local, state, or federal affordable housing program requirements, so rent and fee increases that comply with legally binding and recorded regulatory agreements are not limited by section 201 of this act. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)

__ You live in a manufactured/mobile home community that was purchased during the past 12 months by an eligible organization as defined in RCW 59.20.030 whose mission aligns with the long-term preservation and affordability of your manufactured/mobile home community, so the eligible organization may increase the annual rent and fees combined for your manufactured/mobile home community in an amount greater than allowed under section 201 of this act as needed to cover the cost of purchasing your manufactured/mobile home community if the increase is approved by vote or agreement with the majority of the manufactured/mobile home owners in your manufactured/mobile home community. (The landlord must include facts or attach documents supporting the exemption.)"

## Section 204
The legislature finds that the practices covered by section 201 of this act, section 202 of this act, section 203 of this act, RCW 59.20.060, 59.20.090, and 59.20.170 are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of section 201 of this act, section 202 of this act, section 203 of this act, RCW 59.20.060, 59.20.090, or 59.20.170 by a landlord is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

## Section 205
1. Unless otherwise agreed rental agreements shall be for a term of one year. Any rental agreement of whatever duration shall be automatically renewed for the term of the original rental agreement, unless a different specified term is agreed upon.

2. (a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a landlord seeking to increase the rent upon expiration of the term of a rental agreement of any duration shall notify the tenant in writing three months prior to the effective date of any increase in rent.

    b. If a landlord intends to increase the rent and fees combined in an amount of three percent or more, the landlord must provide written notice to each affected tenant a minimum of 180 days before the effective date of the increase. This subsection (2)(b) does not apply to any tenancy on a manufactured/mobile home lot operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization that qualifies for an exemption under section 202(1) of this act.

3. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a tenant shall notify the landlord in writing one month prior to the expiration of a rental agreement of an intention not to renew.

4. [Empty]

    a. The tenant may terminate the rental agreement upon 30 days written notice whenever a change in the location of the tenant's employment requires a change in his or her residence, and shall not be liable for rental following such termination unless after due diligence and reasonable effort the landlord is not able to rent the mobile home lot at a fair rental. If the landlord is not able to rent the lot, the tenant shall remain liable for the rental specified in the rental agreement until the lot is rented or the original term ends.

    b. Any tenant who is a member of the armed forces, including the national guard and armed forces reserves, or that tenant's spouse or dependent, may terminate a rental agreement with less than 30 days notice if the tenant receives permanent change of station or deployment orders which do not allow greater notice. The service member shall provide the landlord a copy of the official military orders or a signed letter from the service member's commanding officer confirming any of the following criteria are met:

        i. The service member is required, pursuant to permanent change of station orders, to move 35 miles or more from the location of the rental premises;

        ii. The service member is prematurely or involuntarily discharged or released from active duty;

        iii. The service member is released from active duty after having leased the rental premises while on active duty status and the rental premises is 35 miles or more from the service member's home of record prior to entering active duty;

        iv. After entering into a rental agreement, the commanding officer directs the service member to move into government provided housing;

    v. The service member receives temporary duty orders, temporary change of station orders, or state active duty orders to an area 35 miles or more from the location of the rental premises, provided such orders are for a period not less than 90 days; or

    vi. The service member has leased the property, but prior to taking possession of the rental premises, receives change of station orders to an area that is 35 miles or more from the location of the rental premises.

    c. If a landlord provides notice to a tenant that the landlord intends to increase the rent and fees combined in an amount of three percent or more, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement at any time prior to the effective date of the increase by providing the landlord with written notice at least 30 days before terminating the rental agreement. If a tenant terminates a rental agreement under this subsection (4)(c), the tenant only owes pro rata rent through the date upon which the tenant vacates the manufactured/mobile home lot. A landlord may not charge a tenant any fines or fees for terminating a rental agreement under this subsection (4)(c). This subsection (4)(c) does not apply to any tenancy on a manufactured/mobile home lot operated by a public housing authority, public development authority, or nonprofit organization that qualifies for an exemption under section 202(1) of this act.

## Section 206
1. If a landlord charges a tenant any move-in fees or security deposits, the move-in fees and security deposits combined may not exceed one month's rent.

2. All moneys paid to the landlord by the tenant as a deposit as security for performance of the tenant's obligations in a rental agreement shall promptly be deposited by the landlord in a trust account, maintained by the landlord for the purpose of holding such security deposits for tenants of the landlord, in a financial institution as defined by RCW 30A.22.041 or licensed escrow agent located in Washington. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the landlord shall be entitled to receipt of interest paid on such trust account deposits. The landlord shall provide the tenant with a written receipt for the deposit and shall provide written notice of the name and address and location of the depository and any subsequent change thereof. If during a tenancy the status of landlord is transferred to another, any sums in the deposit trust account affected by such transfer shall simultaneously be transferred to an equivalent trust account of the successor landlord, and the successor landlord shall promptly notify the tenant of the transfer and of the name, address and location of the new depository. The tenant's claim to any moneys paid under this section shall be prior to that of any creditor of the landlord, including a trustee in bankruptcy or receiver, even if such moneys are commingled.

## Section 207
1. Any mobile home space tenancy regardless of the term, shall be based upon a written rental agreement, signed by the parties, which shall contain:
