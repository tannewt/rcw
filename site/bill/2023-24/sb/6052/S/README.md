# SB 6052 - Petroleum product supply

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6052-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The state of Washington finds and declares that during an energy transition away from reliance on fossil fuels, but until that transition is complete, petroleum-based transportation fuels are of critical importance to the people and businesses of the state. The legislature further finds and declares that the Washington state government requires: A complete and thorough understanding of the transportation fuels market, to enable it to respond to possible shortages, price shocks, oversupplies, or other disruptions. The legislature also finds that access to timely data collection, analysis, evaluation, and reporting to serve information and policy development needs of the governor, the legislature, public agencies, market participants, and the public is essential.

2. Washington consumers, state and local agencies, businesses, and policymakers, planners, and enforcement agencies lack access to sufficient pricing and operational information held by refinery operators, fuel suppliers, and others in the supply chain for transportation fuels. Such pricing and operational information is critical to understanding the relationship between the price and the cost of production, identifying price and market manipulation, and protecting Washington state consumers, government entities, and businesses. Similar information is already available for other critical fuels, such as electricity.

3. To protect consumers, Washington state must collect detailed pricing and operational information from refineries, fuel suppliers, and others in the transportation fuels supply chain, analyze the data, and provide summarized reports to the public and lawmakers to expose relevant cost and pricing practices in the industry, and to identify market manipulation, unfair or deceptive practices, and any other manner by which market participants act to harm competition or act contrary to the best interests of consumers in the state.

4. Furthermore, to ensure that the market for transportation fuels is free of anticompetitive and predatory conduct, the legislature finds that additional legal consequences are needed to ensure that transportation fuels industry practices do not harm consumers.

The assessment must consider the potential benefits to Washington transportation fuel consumers of creating estimates for the level of transportation fuels at the state level and, to the extent feasible, at regional and local levels, and individual refineries if relevant, that should be held in reserve by refiners to prevent shortages that result in sharp increases in the price of transportation fuels. The assessment must consider all factors causing price fluctuation in retail transportation fuels prices when recommending adequate reserve levels. The division must consider all relevant evidence from any reasonably available source including, but not limited to, information about imports, by amount, source, if known, and data received by the commission under existing laws, economic and business experts, and information from any local, state, and federal agencies.
