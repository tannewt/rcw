<ol>
<li>
<p>The state of Washington finds and declares that during an energy transition away from reliance on fossil fuels, but until that transition is complete, petroleum-based transportation fuels are of critical importance to the people and businesses of the state. The legislature further finds and declares that the Washington state government requires: A complete and thorough understanding of the transportation fuels market, to enable it to respond to possible shortages, price shocks, oversupplies, or other disruptions. The legislature also finds that access to timely data collection, analysis, evaluation, and reporting to serve information and policy development needs of the governor, the legislature, public agencies, market participants, and the public is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington consumers, state and local agencies, businesses, and policymakers, planners, and enforcement agencies lack access to sufficient pricing and operational information held by refinery operators, fuel suppliers, and others in the supply chain for transportation fuels. Such pricing and operational information is critical to understanding the relationship between the price and the cost of production, identifying price and market manipulation, and protecting Washington state consumers, government entities, and businesses. Similar information is already available for other critical fuels, such as electricity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To protect consumers, Washington state must collect detailed pricing and operational information from refineries, fuel suppliers, and others in the transportation fuels supply chain, analyze the data, and provide summarized reports to the public and lawmakers to expose relevant cost and pricing practices in the industry, and to identify market manipulation, unfair or deceptive practices, and any other manner by which market participants act to harm competition or act contrary to the best interests of consumers in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, to ensure that the market for transportation fuels is free of anticompetitive and predatory conduct, the legislature finds that additional legal consequences are needed to ensure that transportation fuels industry practices do not harm consumers.</p>

<p>On or before July 1, 2026, and every three years thereafter, the division, in collaboration with the energy resilience and emergency management office of the department of commerce, must submit an assessment to the legislature, and to the governor that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Identifies methods to ensure a reliable supply of affordable transportation fuels in Washington. The assessment must consider the potential benefits to Washington transportation fuel consumers of creating estimates for the level of transportation fuels at the state level and, to the extent feasible, at regional and local levels, and individual refineries if relevant, that should be held in reserve by refiners to prevent shortages that result in sharp increases in the price of transportation fuels. The assessment must consider all factors causing price fluctuation in retail transportation fuels prices when recommending adequate reserve levels. The division must consider all relevant evidence from any reasonably available source including, but not limited to, information about imports, by amount, source, if known, and data received by the commission under existing laws, economic and business experts, and information from any local, state, and federal agencies. The energy resilience and emergency management office of the department of commerce must transmit to the legislature any proposals it deems appropriate for mandatory reserve levels and the terms of a program to implement reserve levels;</p>

<li>
<p>Evaluates the price of transportation fuels, including branded and unbranded retail prices, alternate formulations of transportation fuels with lower carbon impact, and other products suitable for production from refineries in Washington. This evaluation must consider the market demand for these products at three, seven, 10, and 20-year intervals from the date of the assessment. This evaluation must include both of the following:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) An examination of whether branded fuel additives have any impact and, if so, how much on fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions; and</p>
<p>(B) An assessment of the presence and availability of retail outlets, including monitoring changes in availability of retail outlets that contribute to increasing retail prices in local and regional areas;</p>
<pre><code>    iii. Considers different levels of supply conditions and assesses the impact of potential refinery closures in Washington;

    iv. Includes an analysis of the impacts on production of refinery planned maintenance, unplanned maintenance, and turnaround, utilizing the reports provided by refineries as directed in section 7 of this act. Notwithstanding any other law, the department of labor and industries must disclose to the division, upon request, any information the department has received to ensure all aspects of refinery safety are incorporated into the analysis. All information designated confidential must be treated as confidential by the division;

v. Evaluates the utility and feasibility of alternative methods to maintain adequate supplies of transportation fuels, including delivery alternatives for fuel and components of fuel, such as delivery by rail, and other solutions beyond the activities of refineries, oil terminal operators, major marketers, and other entities; and

vi. Proposes solutions to mitigate any impacts described in the assessment. The solutions must include an assessment of the employment impacts and the cost and cost-effectiveness of any proposal, including cost impacts to all impacted sectors, both public and private. The assessment must include recommendations and alternatives.

b. The first assessment must include the evaluation of transportation fuels refining.

The commission and the department of ecology must determine the contents of the plan, but the plan must include, at a minimum, a discussion of how to ensure that the supply of transportation fuels is affordable, reliable, equitable, and adequate to meet demand, and an evaluation of the readiness of the electrical grid to serve as the main source of energy for the transportation sector and identify shortcomings where actions must be taken to strengthen grid reliability. The plan must be prepared in consultation with a multistakeholder, multiagency work group convened by the division and the department of ecology to identify mechanisms to plan for and monitor progress toward the state's reliable, safe, equitable, and affordable transition away from petroleum fuels in line with declining in-state petroleum demand, RCW 70A.45.020, and chapter 70A.65 RCW.
