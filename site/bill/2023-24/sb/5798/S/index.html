<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For all insurance policies other than medical malpractice insurance policies or fire insurance policies canceled under RCW 48.53.040:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The insurer must deliver or mail written notice of cancellation to the named insured at least 60 days before the effective date of the cancellation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cancellation notice must include the insurer's actual reason for canceling the policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For medical malpractice insurance policies:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The insurer must deliver or mail written notice of the cancellation to the named insured at least 90 days before the effective date of the cancellation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cancellation notice must include the insurer's actual reason for canceling the policy and describe the significant risk factors that led to the insurer's underwriting action, as defined under RCW 48.18.547(1)(e).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an insurer cancels a policy described under (a) or (b) of this subsection for nonpayment of premium, the insurer must deliver or mail the cancellation notice to the named insured at least 10 days before the effective date of the cancellation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an insurer cancels a fire insurance policy under RCW 48.53.040, the insurer must deliver or mail the cancellation notice to the named insured at least five days before the effective date of the cancellation.</p>

The insurer shall retain in its records any such item so mailed, together with its envelope, which was returned by the post office upon failure to find, or deliver the mailing to, the addressee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The affidavit of the individual making or supervising such a mailing, shall constitute prima facie evidence of such facts of the mailing as are therein affirmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The portion of any premium paid to the insurer on account of the policy, unearned because of the cancellation and in amount as computed on the pro rata basis, must be actually paid to the insured or other person entitled thereto as shown by the policy or by any endorsement thereon, or be mailed to the insured or such person as soon as possible, and no later than 45 days after the date of notice of cancellation to the insured for homeowners', dwelling fire, and private passenger auto. Any such payment may be made by cash, or by check, bank draft, or money order.</p>
</li>
<li>

If cancellation is for nonpayment of premium, or is within the first 30 days after the contract has been in effect, at least 10 days' notice of cancellation, accompanied by the reason therefor, shall be given.
