# SB 5943 - Resource data tool

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5943.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that Washington residents would benefit from having a quick and seamless digital way to connect to services and that state agencies should explore opportunities to provide such services in a way that builds off of the work of their peers by maximizing the state's investments and reducing the duplication of staff efforts in the provision of services. The legislature finds that the advisory group created in this act will have the expertise and experience to bring together ideas for developing a resource data tool, which includes a mobile application and web portal, that may assist Washington residents in gaining access to a variety of existing services, such as social, behavioral health, and housing services. While many providers, both public and private, currently offer these types of services in Washington, the residents of our state do not always have an easy way to learn more about, and use, those services. It is the intent of the legislature that the advisory group created in this act will collaborate with WIN 211, as defined in RCW 43.211.020, in providing a plan for developing a resource data tool that will easily connect Washingtonians to the services they may need and that will ensure the services are provided in an efficient, cost-effective manner.

## Section 2
1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, WIN 211 shall develop and implement a resource data tool. The development of the resource data tool must be performed in collaboration with the advisory group created in section 3 of this act.

2. The resource data tool developed by WIN 211 shall include a mobile application for the purpose of assisting users in accessing state and private resources and services. The mobile application must be named "Whole WA."

3. Before a state agency, department, or funded program that provides health and human services establishes a new public community resource database, internet-based directory, or mobile application, the state agency, department, or program shall consult with WIN 211 about accessing resource data through the "Whole WA" resource data tool to ensure no duplication of service or cost to the state.

## Section 3
1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, WIN 211 shall convene a "Whole WA" advisory group. The advisory group shall be composed of experts, interested parties, and other similar stakeholders, convened by WIN 211. The purpose of the advisory group created in this section is to develop a plan and framework for launching the resource data tool, including a web portal and mobile application, making public and private services and programs more accessible. The advisory group created in this section shall complete development and launch of the resource data tool no later than January 1, 2025. The advisory group created in this section is dissolved upon the expiration of this section.

2. This section expires January 1, 2025.

## Section 4
Sections 1 through 3 of this act are each added to chapter 43.211 RCW.
