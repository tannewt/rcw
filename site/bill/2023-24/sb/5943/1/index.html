<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington residents would benefit from having a quick and seamless digital way to connect to services and that state agencies should explore opportunities to provide such services in a way that builds off of the work of their peers by maximizing the state's investments and reducing the duplication of staff efforts in the provision of services. The legislature finds that the advisory group created in this act will have the expertise and experience to bring together ideas for developing a resource data tool, which includes a mobile application and web portal, that may assist Washington residents in gaining access to a variety of existing services, such as social, behavioral health, and housing services. While many providers, both public and private, currently offer these types of services in Washington, the residents of our state do not always have an easy way to learn more about, and use, those services. It is the intent of the legislature that the advisory group created in this act will collaborate with WIN 211, as defined in RCW 43.211.020, in providing a plan for developing a resource data tool that will easily connect Washingtonians to the services they may need and that will ensure the services are provided in an efficient, cost-effective manner.</p>
