<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Local jurisdictions changing the voting system used to select candidates and choosing alternative methods of candidate selection not defined in chapter 29A.52 RCW must be responsible for educating all voters affected by the change and seeks to define minimum levels of voter education to be conducted by county election offices in conjunction with any voting jurisdiction making a change;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the methods of candidate selection are very different from the methods defined in chapter 29A.52 RCW it is necessary for county election offices in conjunction with the voting jurisdiction making the change to ensure full education of all voters participating in the changed system including persons with limited English language proficiency, limited literacy, and intellectual disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voter education should be accomplished in several ways, including by providing detailed information to each voter via United States postal service mail describing the method to be used in selecting candidates while contrasting the changed method with the method employed by the jurisdiction prior to the change. This notice must be in addition to any information provided in voter pamphlets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notice must be translated into the languages required for that jurisdiction by federal law; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication will best be served by the voting jurisdiction providing an electronic information portal, or website, available to voters 24 hours a day for a minimum period of 12 months prior to the beginning of the candidate selection process, fully describing the changed process, and providing answers to frequently asked questions. This information portal must be translated and available in the required languages being used by voters living in the jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever a voting jurisdiction changes the method of candidate selection used in that jurisdiction from the methods described in this chapter, that jurisdiction, in conjunction and cooperation with the county auditor, must make notification to the public of the change and create a public education campaign intended to familiarize the voting public with any unique elements of the new process. This includes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Production and distribution of education materials to each voter of the jurisdiction provided via the voter's mailing address found in each voter registration record, using the United States postal service for delivery.</p>

<p>(A) Persons with limited English proficiency and for whom English is not their first language;</p>
<p>(B) Persons with special needs and intellectual disabilities that require assistance in understanding the new method of candidate selection; and</p>
<p>(C) Students and future voters living within the voting jurisdiction.</p>
<pre><code>    ii. The materials must be translated into all languages required by federal, state, and local law for voting in the jurisdiction.

    iii. These materials, production, and distribution shall be in addition to any voter pamphlet materials provided on the subject;

b. Creation of an electronic information portal, or website, fully describing and explaining the changed process and contrasting it with the current method of candidate selection. This resource shall:

    i. Be available to voters beginning in January of the year in which the new candidate selection process will be used;

</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any voter eligible to participate in an election in a voting jurisdiction that has changed the method of candidate selection to a method other than those required in this chapter who finds the public education and outreach campaign associated with the change inadequate in meeting the requirements of section 2 of this act may file an action against the voting jurisdiction and the election office serving the voting jurisdiction in the appropriate court of record serving the voting jurisdiction. The court shall give any filing and associated case priority on its calendar and may award financial damages as appropriate. A cause of action cannot be used to abridge the required education period. A voting jurisdiction found to have failed to provide the full required education program may be assessed a monetary fine, and if the court finds that failure to provide the full required education program resulted in cost savings to the voting jurisdiction, the court may award statutory damages up to twice the amount of any savings documented to the court.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sections 2 and 3 of this act are each added to chapter 29A.52 RCW.</p>
