<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that green energy provides economic and environmental benefits by creating opportunities for jobs, and innovation by replacing dirtier forms of energy. The legislature further finds that many, but not all, of these benefits occur at the regional and global levels, beyond the districts where projects are located. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a program to ensure those broad benefits are shared with the host communities by creating pathways to invest state tax revenue back into local communities. This act creates a mechanism to ensure that more of the taxes from new green energy projects are fed back into the districts where they are located.</p>
