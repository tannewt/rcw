<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that through tax incentives, the private market can assist Washington in meeting its housing goals, allowing the state to focus its resources on serving households making below 50 percent of the area median income. Furthermore, by providing adequate housing stock for households making 50 to 80 percent of the area median income, those households will not compete with persons in lower income brackets for more affordable units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that constructing new housing units can take years, and many existing buildings can be repurposed quickly to meet the state's workforce and affordable housing needs. Many existing buildings are located in downtown centers, near work and services where there is limited land available for new construction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many downtown centers lack available affordable housing, which results in long commutes that increase greenhouse gas emissions. The legislature recognizes that by using existing buildings to create affordable housing units, units can be available more quickly and with a reduced impact on waste streams and the environment compared to newly constructed units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to incentivize the repurposing of existing buildings for workforce and affordable housing by creating a property tax shift and a sales and use tax remittance.</p>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Real property exempted under this chapter continue to be exempted for the applicable period under this chapter if the improvements continue to satisfy all applicable conditions. If the owner intends to discontinue compliance with the affordable housing requirements as described in this chapter or any other condition to the exemption, the owner must notify tenants and the jurisdiction 60 days before the owner's discontinuance. If the city is notified by the owner, or if the city discovers that a portion of the property no longer meets the qualifications of the tax exemption, the tax exemption is canceled, and the following must occur:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Additional real property tax must be imposed on the property. This additional tax is the difference between the property tax paid and the property tax that would have been paid if the property had included the value of the nonqualifying improvements, for each of the prior 10 years during which the exemption was in effect;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional interest is owed upon the amounts of the additional property tax at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes, calculated from the dates on which the additional tax would have been payable without the tax exemption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A penalty is owed in the amount equal to 20 percent of the additional property tax imposed under this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additional tax, interest, and penalty are a lien on the real property and attach at the time the property or portion of the property is removed from exempted status. The lien has priority to, and must be fully paid and satisfied before, a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the land may become charged or liable, except that the lien is of equal rank with liens for amounts deferred under chapter 84.37 or 84.38 RCW. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent ad valorem property taxes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon a determination that a tax exemption is to be canceled for a reason stated in this section, the governing authority or designated administrative official or agent of the governing authority must notify the taxpayer, shown by the tax rolls by certified mail, and the assessor, of the determination to cancel the tax exemption. The owner may appeal the determination within 30 days of the date of the notice by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the governing authority, specifying the factual and legal basis upon which the determination of cancellation is alleged to be erroneous. The governing authority or designated administrative official or agent may hear the appeal. At the hearing, all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that the governing authority's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. After the hearing, the decision maker must affirm, modify, or overturn the decision to cancel the tax exemption based on the evidence received. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the deciding body or officer to the superior court. The governing authority must also notify the assessor of the final disposition of the appeal.</p>
