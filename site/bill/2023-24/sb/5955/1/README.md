# SB 5955 - Large port districts

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5955.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that airports are an important part of Washington's economy. Airports enable travel for business or recreation, allow for the transportation of cargo, and provide thousands of jobs for the people of the state.

For those living near an airport, however, there can also be adverse environmental and health impacts from airport noise and air pollution. In King county, the majority of people identifying as Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander live within 10 miles of Seattle-Tacoma international airport. A 2019 study conducted by the King county department of health found that this population faces health, resource, and risk disparities as compared to the rest of the county. Health issues within the community included a greater percentage of infants born prematurely, higher hospitalization rates for asthma, stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower life expectancy and higher rates of death when compared to the county as a whole. Many of these conditions were found at higher rates the closer the population lived to the airport.

It is the intent of the legislature that port districts operating large airports in the state dedicate a portion of the property tax they levy toward the mitigation of some of the impacts of noise and air pollution that can be faced by communities near the airport. The legislature also intends to provide additional assistance to ports in fulfilling this goal and their environmental and community-related missions. With these resources, ports can be a more responsive community partner and help to uphold the values of respect, antiracism and equity, integrity, and stewardship.

## Section 2
1. A district may raise revenue by levy of an annual tax not to exceed $0.45 per $1,000 of assessed value against the assessed valuation of the taxable property in such port district for general port purposes, including the establishment of a capital improvement fund for future capital improvements, except that any levy for the payment of the principal and interest of the general bonded indebtedness of the port district shall be in excess of any levy made by the port district under the $0.45 per $1,000 of assessed value limitation. The levy shall be made and taxes collected in the manner provided for the levy and collection of taxes in school districts of the first class.

2. After July 1, 2024, for any increase in the dollar amount of a district's levy revenue over the district's prior year's levy at least half of the dollar amount of such revenue increase must be utilized for mitigation programs under section 3 of this act.

3. [Empty]

    a. After July 1, 2025, at least one percent of a port districts annual tax levy revenue must be utilized for mitigation programs under section 3 of this act.

    b. For each year subsequent to the first year that a port district becomes subject to (a) of this subsection, an additional one percent of the port district's annual tax levy revenue must be utilized for mitigation programs under section 3 of this act, to a maximum of 10 percent.

4. Revenue subject to the requirements in subsections (2) and (3) of this section must be maintained by the port district in a separate account.

5. The requirements in subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section only apply to port districts authorized to undertake programs for the abatement of aircraft noise under RCW 53.54.010. If a port district becomes qualified to undertake such a program after July 1, 2024, then the requirements in subsections (2) and (3) of this section take effect in the fiscal year immediately following the year in which the port district becomes qualified.

## Section 3
1. Port districts authorized to undertake programs for the abatement of aircraft noise under this chapter must additionally undertake a remedial mitigation program as provided in this section.
