<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that airports are an important part of Washington's economy. Airports enable travel for business or recreation, allow for the transportation of cargo, and provide thousands of jobs for the people of the state.</p>
<p>For those living near an airport, however, there can also be adverse environmental and health impacts from airport noise and air pollution. In King county, the majority of people identifying as Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander live within 10 miles of Seattle-Tacoma international airport. A 2019 study conducted by the King county department of health found that this population faces health, resource, and risk disparities as compared to the rest of the county. Health issues within the community included a greater percentage of infants born prematurely, higher hospitalization rates for asthma, stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower life expectancy and higher rates of death when compared to the county as a whole. Many of these conditions were found at higher rates the closer the population lived to the airport.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that port districts operating large airports in the state dedicate a portion of the property tax they levy toward the mitigation of some of the impacts of noise and air pollution that can be faced by communities near the airport. The legislature also intends to provide additional assistance to ports in fulfilling this goal and their environmental and community-related missions. With these resources, ports can be a more responsive community partner and help to uphold the values of respect, antiracism and equity, integrity, and stewardship.</p>
