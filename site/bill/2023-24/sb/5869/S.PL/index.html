<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that fire protection is a critical component in maximizing fire preparedness and response in rural and suburban areas of the state that are living with increasing fire danger. Even though this year was not characterized by excessive forest fires, the fires that did happen were devastating. The legislature finds that areas with existing communities that oftentimes include rural school districts and fire districts need the ability to increase fire preparedness and response times. The experiences of the last few years have shown that rapid response is highly effective in reducing the destruction of wildfires. The legislature intends to be a partner with these communities in maximizing fire protection by enabling existing fire districts to expand their services.</p>
