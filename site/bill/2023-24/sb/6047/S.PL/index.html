<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The climate commitment act requires some publicly owned natural gas and electric utilities and other government agencies to obtain greenhouse gas allowances to cover a portion of emissions. Because the allowance auctions must be carefully regulated to guard against market interference, market participants are strictly prohibited from disclosing any information about how they plan to participate in a specific auction. Investor-owned utilities, which are governed by a private board of directors, are able to keep this information confidential. In contrast, many public agencies are overseen by governing boards that are subject to the open public meetings act, which requires that deliberations be conducted in public. This act allows the governing body of a public agency to meet in executive session to consider the information necessary to comply with the climate commitment act's protection of all information necessary to participate in the greenhouse gas allowance market.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1) Nothing contained in this chapter may be construed to prevent a governing body from holding an executive session during a regular or special meeting:</p>
