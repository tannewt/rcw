# SB 5482 - Margin tax

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5482.pdf)

## Section 101
1. The legislature finds that the state's business and occupation tax, as a gross receipts tax, imposes significant hardships on new businesses, small businesses, and unprofitable and low profit-margin businesses. The legislature further finds that the piecemeal enactment of countless tax preferences to ameliorate these hardships has led to an exceedingly complex tax. The legislature intends to address these issues and improve Washington's economy by converting the business and occupation tax into a modified gross receipts tax to be known as the margin tax. Like the business and occupation tax, the margin tax is imposed upon virtually all business activities carried on within the state, other than those specifically exempt under the constitutions or laws of this state or of the United States.

2. The legislature recognizes that this proposal, if passed, would reduce the amount distributed to tribes who have entered into compacts under chapter 132, Laws of 2020, as they are currently receiving 100 percent of business and occupation tax from retail sales taxable transactions sourced to a compacting tribe's compact covered area. With the passage of this act, it is not the intent of the legislature to reduce compacting tribes' benefits under tax revenue-sharing compacts. It is the intent of the legislature for the department of revenue to fulfill its compact obligations to discuss any changes in the compact or authorizing acts that may be appropriate to preserve the intended benefits of each compact.

3. The legislature also recognizes that the federal permanent internet tax freedom act generally prohibits state and local governments from imposing a tax on internet access but expressly excludes certain taxes from this prohibition, including Washington's business and occupation tax. The legislature does not intend by this act to exempt internet access from any tax imposed in this act. Therefore, the legislature intends for the taxes imposed in this act to be considered a modification of the business and occupation tax.

8. In calculating a taxpayer's taxable margin during an audit for a tax year for which the taxpayer failed to file a tax return, the department must use the deduction under this section that appears to the department to be the most advantageous to the taxpayer.

## Section 204
1. A taxpayer that elects to deduct its cost inputs for the purpose of computing its taxable margin under section 203 of this act must determine the amount of the cost inputs as provided by this section.

2. [Empty]

    a. The cost inputs deductible under section 203 of this act are the cost of goods sold properly reportable for federal income tax purposes. The department need not accept the cost of goods sold reported on the taxpayer's federal income tax return if the department determines that such amount is in error.

    b. For taxpayers that would be able to report cost of goods sold for federal income tax purposes if they were subject to federal income tax, the cost inputs deductible under section 203 of this act are the cost of goods sold that would be properly reportable for federal income tax purposes if the taxpayer were subject to federal income tax.

    c. For purposes of the tax imposed under section 202(2) of this act, cost inputs are limited to the costs of goods sold for products manufactured or extracted in Washington, whether for sale or for commercial or industrial use.

3. A combined group that elects to subtract cost of goods sold must determine that amount by:

    b. Adding the amounts determined under (a) of this subsection (3).

## Section 205
1. A taxpayer that elects to deduct compensation to determine taxable margin under section 203 of this act may deduct an amount equal to:

    a. The total amount of compensation paid to the taxpayer's employees during the tax year, less any amount of compensation in excess of the compensation cap in (b) of this subsection (1).

    b. For purposes of this subsection (1), the compensation cap applies on a per-employee basis and is $400,000 per employee for the tax year beginning January 1, 2027. The compensation cap is adjusted for subsequent tax years as provided by section 206 of this act.

2. If an employee receives compensation from more than one member of a combined group, the combined group may not deduct in relation to that employee a total of more than the compensation cap.

3. A combined group that elects to deduct compensation must determine the amount of the deduction by:

    a. Determining the compensation for each of its members as provided by this section as if each member were an individual taxable entity, subject to the limitations prescribed by subsections (1) and (2) of this section; and

    b. Adding the amounts determined under (a) of this subsection (3).

## Section 206
1. Effective for tax years beginning January 1, 2029, and every two years thereafter, the department must adjust the standard deduction and compensation deduction cap as prescribed by sections 203 and 205 of this act respectively. The adjustment is calculated by multiplying the previous standard deduction and compensation deduction cap by the sum of one plus the percentage increase in the consumer price index during the preceding state fiscal biennium, rounded to the nearest $10,000. If the consumer price index decreased during the preceding state fiscal biennium, the department shall not adjust the standard deduction and compensation cap deduction.

2. The department must publish the updated standard deduction and compensation deduction cap on its website.

3. For purposes of this section, "consumer price index" means the seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U), United States city average, as most recently published by November 20th by the United States bureau of labor statistics or its successor agency.

## Section 207
1. For purposes of determining the proper amount of any tax due under this chapter, taxable margin, value of products, and gross income of the business, including gross proceeds of sales, are allocated and apportioned as provided in this section.

2. Except for taxable margin and gross income of the business allocated under the provisions of subsection (4) or (5) of this section, taxable margin and gross income of the business are apportioned to this state by multiplying the taxable margin or gross income of the business by a fraction, as follows:

    a. The numerator of the fraction is the taxpayer's gross income of the business attributed to Washington as provided in section 208 of this act;

    b. The denominator of the fraction is the worldwide gross income of the business.

3. A taxpayer that is required to file returns as a combined group must include in the numerator computed under subsection (2)(a) of this section the gross income of the business from engaging in business in Washington of each affiliate that is a member of the combined group, without regard to whether that entity has a substantial nexus with this state for the purpose of the taxes imposed in this chapter.

4. [Empty]

    a. Except as otherwise provided in (b) of this subsection (4), in the case of manufacturing, extracting, processing for hire, extracting for hire, and selling standing timber, where a business is subject to tax under section 202(2) of this act or RCW 82.04.261, the taxable margin, value of products, and gross income of the business from those activities conducted in this state is allocated to this state in its entirety.

    b. Where the manufacturing of a product occurs partly within and outside of this state, the taxpayer must attribute the portion of the measure of tax that reasonably reflects the extent of the manufacturing activity that occurred within this state.

5. In the case of the surcharge imposed in RCW 82.04.261 on wholesale sales, the gross proceeds of sales are allocated to this state in the same manner as retail sales are sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730 for retail sales tax purposes.

## Section 208
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4)(d) of this section, gross income of the business is attributable to Washington as provided in this section.

2. In the case of gross income of the business from the retail sale or wholesale sale of any product, the gross income of the business is attributed to this state if the sale is sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730 for purposes of the retail sales tax or would be sourced to this state under that statute if the retail sales tax imposed in chapter 82.08 RCW applied to that sale.

3. In the case of gross income of the business from the granting of a right to use, enter, or enjoy real property, the gross income of the business is attributed to this state if the real property is located in this state. If the real property is located in this and any other state, the gross income of the business must be attributed to this state in proportion to the area of the real property located in this state relative to the total area of the real property both within and outside of this state.

4. [Empty]

    a. In the case of gross income of the business from services or from royalties for the use of the taxpayer's intangible property, other than activities described in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the gross income of the business is attributed to this state if the customer received the benefit of the taxpayer's service or, in the case of gross income from royalties, the customer used the taxpayer's intangible property, in this state. When a customer receives the benefit of the taxpayer's services or uses the taxpayer's intangible property in this and one or more other states, the taxpayer must attribute to this state a portion of gross income of the business that reasonably reflects the extent to which the customer received the benefit of the taxpayer's services or used the taxpayer's intangible property in this state.

    b. In the case of gross income of the business generated from activities other than those described in (a) of this subsection (4) and subsections (2) and (3) of this section, gross income of the business is attributed to this state to the extent that the gross income of the business fairly represents those business activities of the taxpayer conducted in this state.

    c. For purposes of this section, gross income of the business must be excluded from the denominator of the receipts factor if, in respect to such gross income of the business, at least some of the activity that generated that income is performed in this state, and the gross income of the business would be attributable to a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable if that state's business activity tax laws were identical to the provisions of this chapter.

    d. (a) through (c) of this subsection (4) do not apply to financial institutions. For gross income of the business that would otherwise be attributed as provided in this subsection (4), financial institutions must calculate the receipts factor as provided in a rule that the department must adopt. The rule required under this subsection (4)(d) must, to the extent feasible, be consistent with the multistate tax commission's recommended formula for the apportionment and allocation of net income of financial institutions as it existed on the effective date of this section or a subsequent date as may be provided by the department by rule, consistent with the purposes of this section, except that:

        i. The department's rule must provide for a single factor apportionment method based on the receipts factor; and

        ii. The definition of "financial institution" contained in appendix A to the multistate tax commission's recommended formula for the apportionment and allocation of net income of financial institutions is advisory only.

5. For purposes of this section, the definitions in this subsection apply.

    a. "Business activities tax" means a tax measured by the amount of, or economic results of, business activity conducted in a state. "Business activities tax" includes taxes measured in whole or in part on net income or gross income or receipts, including taxes similar to the margin tax imposed in this chapter. "Business activities tax" does not include a sales tax, use tax, or a similar transaction tax, imposed on the sale or acquisition of goods or services, whether or not denominated a gross receipts tax or a tax imposed on the privilege of doing business.

    b. "Customer" means a person or entity to whom the taxpayer makes a sale, renders services, or who pays royalties or charges in the nature of royalties for the use of the taxpayer's intangible property.

    c. "Not taxable" means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that state, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a state in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with that state under the standards in RCW 82.04.067 regardless of whether that state imposes such a tax.

    d. "State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any foreign country or political subdivision of a foreign country.

## Section 209
1. A combined group must register with the department, file, and pay the taxes imposed in this chapter as a single taxpayer.

2. The combined group must designate a single member as the reporting entity to register, file, and pay taxes on behalf of the combined group. The combined group may change the reporting entity only when the entity no longer has substantial nexus with this state under RCW 82.04.067, is no longer a member of the combined group, or as otherwise permitted or required by the department, at which time the combined group must designate another entity as the reporting entity.

3. The department may collect identifying information about all members of a combined group and may require disclosure to the department, for each member, of the business activity inside and outside of this state.

4. Each affiliate that is part of a combined group must, for purposes of determining taxable margin and apportioned taxable margin, include its activities for the same tax period as the combined group.

5. Each affiliate that is part of a combined group is jointly and severally liable for the taxes owed by the combined group.

6. A combined group includes all of its affiliated members, including those that do not have a substantial nexus with this state under RCW 82.04.067. However, a combined group may elect to exclude foreign members from the combined group that have not engaged within this state in business during the tax year. The department may by rule adopt policies and procedures for elections made under this subsection.

## Section 210
For any taxpayer that is a combined group, the taxpayer is subject to any tax imposed in this chapter expressly on a taxpayer engaging in a specific business activity, including the taxes imposed in section 202(2) of this act and RCW 82.04.261 through 82.04.299, if any member of the taxpayer's combined group engages in the specific business activity within this state.

## Section 211
1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a taxpayer who is subject to the margin tax under section 202(1) of this act and whose gross income of the business for the tax year from its entire business is not more than $5,000,000 may elect to pay the tax imposed under section 202(1) of this act in the amount computed and at the rate provided by this section rather than in the amount computed and at the tax rate provided under section 202 of this act.

2. The amount of the tax due under the method authorized in this section is computed by:

    a. Determining the taxpayer's gross income of the business from all activities subject to tax under section 202(1) of this act;

    b. Apportioning the amount determined under (a) of this subsection (2) as provided by sections 207 and 208 of this act; and

    c. Multiplying the amount computed under (b) of this subsection (2) by 1.75 percent.

3. A taxpayer that elects to pay the tax as provided by this section may not claim any deduction provided for in section 203 of this act.

4. The option for taxpayers to apply the tax rate under this section does not apply to taxpayers engaged in the business of air commerce or air transportation as defined in 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40102 as it existed on the effective date of this section, or a subsequent date as may be provided by the department by rule, consistent with the purposes of this section.

## Section 212
1. Before adopting a rule described in subsection (5) of this section, an agency must:

    a. Clearly state in detail the general goals and specific objectives of the statute that the rule implements;

    b. Determine that the rule is needed to achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection, and analyze alternatives to rule making and the consequences of not adopting the rule;

    c. Provide notification in the notice of proposed rule making under RCW 34.05.320 that a preliminary cost-benefit analysis is available. The preliminary cost-benefit analysis must fulfill the requirements of the cost-benefit analysis under (d) of this subsection. If the agency files a supplemental notice under RCW 34.05.340, the supplemental notice must include notification that a revised preliminary cost-benefit analysis is available. A final cost-benefit analysis must be available when the rule is adopted under RCW 34.05.360;

    d. Determine that the probable benefits of the rule are greater than its probable costs, taking into account both the qualitative and quantitative benefits and costs and the specific directives of the statute being implemented;

    e. Determine, after considering alternative versions of the rule and the analysis required under (b), (c), and (d) of this subsection, that the rule being adopted is the least burdensome alternative for those required to comply with it that will achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection;

    f. Determine that the rule does not require those to whom it applies to take an action that violates requirements of another federal or state law;

    g. Determine that the rule does not impose more stringent performance requirements on private entities than on public entities unless required to do so by federal or state law;

    h. Determine if the rule differs from any federal regulation or statute applicable to the same activity or subject matter and, if so, determine that the difference is justified by the following:

    i. A state statute that explicitly allows the agency to differ from federal standards; or

        ii. Substantial evidence that the difference is necessary to achieve the general goals and specific objectives stated under (a) of this subsection; and

        i. Coordinate the rule, to the maximum extent practicable, with other federal, state, and local laws applicable to the same activity or subject matter.

2. In making its determinations pursuant to subsection (1)(b) through (h) of this section, the agency must place in the rule-making file documentation of sufficient quantity and quality so as to persuade a reasonable person that the determinations are justified.

3. Before adopting rules described in subsection (5) of this section, an agency must place in the rule-making file a rule implementation plan for rules filed under each adopting order. The plan must describe how the agency intends to:

    a. Implement and enforce the rule, including a description of the resources the agency intends to use;

    b. Inform and educate affected persons about the rule;

    c. Promote and assist voluntary compliance; and

    d. Evaluate whether the rule achieves the purpose for which it was adopted, including, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of interim milestones to assess progress and the use of objectively measurable outcomes.

4. After adopting a rule described in subsection (5) of this section regulating the same activity or subject matter as another provision of federal or state law, an agency must do all of the following:

    a. Coordinate implementation and enforcement of the rule with the other federal and state entities regulating the same activity or subject matter by making every effort to do one or more of the following:

        i. Deferring to the other entity;

        ii. Designating a lead agency; or

        iii. Entering into an agreement with the other entities specifying how the agency and entities will coordinate implementation and enforcement.

If the agency is unable to comply with this subsection (4)(a), the agency must report to the legislature pursuant to (b) of this subsection;

    b. Report to the joint administrative rules review committee:

        i. The existence of any overlap or duplication of other federal or state laws, any differences from federal law, and any known overlap, duplication, or conflict with local laws; and

        ii. Make recommendations for any legislation that may be necessary to eliminate or mitigate any adverse effects of such overlap, duplication, or difference.

5. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, this section applies to:

        i. Significant legislative rules of the departments of ecology, labor and industries, health, revenue, social and health services, and natural resources, the employment security department, the forest practices board, the office of the insurance commissioner, the state building code council, and to the legislative rules of the department of fish and wildlife implementing chapter 77.55 RCW; and

        ii. Any rule of any agency, if this section is voluntarily made applicable to the rule by the agency, or is made applicable to the rule by a majority vote of the joint administrative rules review committee within forty-five days of receiving the notice of proposed rule making under RCW 34.05.320.

    b. This section does not apply to:

(B) For taxpayers that were engaged in business in this state during the entire immediately preceding tax year and filed a tax return for that tax year for taxes due under section 202 of this act, each estimated margin tax payment equals 25 percent of the taxpayer's total tax liability on that return. Upon a taxpayer's request, the department may allow a taxpayer to calculate its own estimated payment amount if the taxpayer certifies that it expects that its tax due under section 202 of this act for the current tax year to be at least 20 percent greater or less than its tax due under section 202 of this act for the previous tax year.

(C) For the first tax year of margin taxes due under section 202 of this act, or for taxpayers who were not engaged in business in this state during the entire immediately preceding tax year or who did not file a return for taxes due under section 202 of this act for that tax year, estimated payments equal 25 percent of the estimated tax liability under section 202 of this act for the current tax year as determined by the taxpayer.

## Section 503
1. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, interest applies to taxes that are not paid by the original due date even though the department has granted an extension as authorized under this chapter. However, the department may not assess penalties for late payment of any such tax that is paid in full by the extended due date.

2. For purposes of this section, "taxes" includes estimated taxes due under RCW 82.32.045.

## Section 504
1. If payment of any tax due on a return to be filed by a taxpayer is not received by the department of revenue by the due date, there is assessed a penalty of nine percent of the amount of the tax; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of nineteen percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if the tax is not received on or before the last day of the second month following the due date, there is assessed a total penalty of twenty-nine percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than five dollars.

2. If the department of revenue determines that any tax or estimated tax payment due under RCW 82.32.045 has been substantially underpaid, there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax determined by the department to be due. If payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received by the department by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof, including any estimated payment due under RCW 82.32.045 and billed to the taxpayer by the department, there is assessed a total penalty of fifteen percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received on or before the thirtieth day following the due date specified in the notice of tax due, or any extension thereof, including any estimated payment due under RCW 82.32.045 and billed to the taxpayer by the department, there is assessed a total penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection. No penalty so added may be less than five dollars. As used in this section, "substantially underpaid" means that the taxpayer has paid less than eighty percent of the amount of tax determined by the department to be due for all of the types of taxes included in, and for the entire period of time covered by, the department's examination, and the amount of underpayment is at least one thousand dollars. In the case of an estimated payment due under RCW 82.32.045, "substantially underpaid" means that the taxpayer has paid less than 90 percent of the amount of estimated payment billed to the taxpayer, or when the taxpayer calculates the amount of its estimated payments, the aggregate amount of estimated payments for the tax year is less than 90 percent of the taxpayer's actual tax liability under section 202 of this act for that tax year.

3. If a warrant is issued by the department of revenue for the collection of taxes, increases, and penalties, there is added thereto a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax, but not less than ten dollars.

4. If the department finds that a taxpayer has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that taxpayer has not obtained from the department a registration certificate as required by RCW 82.32.030, the department must impose a penalty of five percent of the amount of tax due from that taxpayer for the period that the taxpayer was not registered as required by RCW 82.32.030. The department may not impose the penalty under this subsection (4) if a taxpayer who has engaged in business taxable under this title without first having registered as required by RCW 82.32.030, prior to any notification by the department of the need to register, obtains a registration certificate from the department.

5. If the department finds that a taxpayer has disregarded specific written instructions as to reporting or tax liabilities, or willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically, as provided by RCW 82.32.080, the department must add a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax that should have been reported and/or paid electronically or the additional tax found due if there is a deficiency because of the failure to follow the instructions. A taxpayer disregards specific written instructions when the department has informed the taxpayer in writing of the taxpayer's tax obligations and the taxpayer fails to act in accordance with those instructions unless, in the case of a deficiency, the department has not issued final instructions because the matter is under appeal pursuant to this chapter or departmental regulations. The department may not assess the penalty under this section upon any taxpayer who has made a good faith effort to comply with the specific written instructions provided by the department to that taxpayer. A taxpayer will be considered to have made a good faith effort to comply with specific written instructions to file returns and/or remit taxes electronically only if the taxpayer can show good cause, as defined in RCW 82.32.080, for the failure to comply with such instructions. A taxpayer will be considered to have willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically if the department has mailed or otherwise delivered the specific written instructions to the taxpayer on at least two occasions. Specific written instructions may be given as a part of a tax assessment, audit, determination, closing agreement, or other written communication, provided that such specific written instructions apply only to the taxpayer addressed or referenced on such communication. Any specific written instructions by the department must be clearly identified as such and must inform the taxpayer that failure to follow the instructions may subject the taxpayer to the penalties imposed by this subsection. If the department determines that it is necessary to provide specific written instructions to a taxpayer that does not comply with the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.080, the specific written instructions must provide the taxpayer with a minimum of forty-five days to come into compliance with its electronic filing and/or payment obligations before the department may impose the penalty authorized in this subsection.

6. If the department finds that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from engaging in a disregarded transaction, as described in RCW 82.32.655(3), the department must assess a penalty of thirty-five percent of the additional tax found to be due as a result of engaging in a transaction disregarded by the department under RCW 82.32.655(2). The penalty provided in this subsection may be assessed together with any other applicable penalties provided in this section on the same tax found to be due, except for the evasion penalty provided in subsection (7) of this section. The department may not assess the penalty under this subsection if, before the department discovers the taxpayer's use of a transaction described under RCW 82.32.655(3), the taxpayer discloses its participation in the transaction to the department.

7. If the department finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable hereunder, a further penalty of fifty percent of the additional tax found to be due must be added.

8. The penalties imposed under subsections (1) through (4) of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.

9. The department may not impose the evasion penalty in combination with the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions or the penalty provided in subsection (6) of this section on the same tax found to be due.

10. For the purposes of this section, "return" means any document a taxpayer is required by the state of Washington to file, whether by paper or electronically, to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the department, and that has a statutorily defined due date. "Return" includes any form a taxpayer must file to report an estimated margin tax payment as calculated by the taxpayer pursuant to RCW 82.32.045.
