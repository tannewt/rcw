<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to other provisions of this chapter and subject to rules adopted by the board, the department may lease state lands, water rights, and physical trust assets, deemed by the department to be temporarily available for use on nonstate land, for purposes it deems advisable including, but not limited to, commercial, industrial, residential, agricultural, and recreational purposes in order to obtain a fair market rental return to the state or the appropriate constitutional or statutory trust, and if the lease is in the best interest of the state or affected trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, in leases for residential purposes, the board may waive or modify any conditions of the lease if the waiver or modification is necessary to enable any federal agency or lending institution authorized to do business in this state or elsewhere in the United States to participate in any loan secured by a security interest in a leasehold interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leasing of water rights under this chapter requires a minimum  60-day advance notice to any potentially impacted federally recognized tribe to determine if the lease or associated actions may impact fish, aquatic resources, cultural resources, or other treaty-reserved rights or tribal resources. Upon notice under this section, a potentially impacted federally recognized tribe may request formal consultation during the notice period or at any time before the lease is finalized. The department shall not enter into a final lease agreement, if a tribe requests consultation under this section, until consultation occurs and any impacts and protections to treaty-reserved resources are addressed by the department.</p>
