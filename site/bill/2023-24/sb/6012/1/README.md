This process must meet the requirements in this section.

2. By August 1, 2024, the board, in collaboration with the office of the superintendent of public instruction and the state board of education, shall develop a list of changes to the educational system in statute and rule during the last 10 years that might require pedagogical changes in programs.

    b. The group of educators must include a wide variety of representatives from different subject matter areas including, but not limited to, any shortage areas, different grade levels, rural and urban school districts, large and small school districts, schools participating in the mastery-based learning collaborative, schools implementing inclusionary practices to support students with disabilities, and educators of color.

5. After December 1, 2026, the board, in collaboration with policy experts from relevant education agencies, shall develop an ongoing and collaborative process to help programs continue to update their action plans and respond to the continuously changing needs of the modern classroom.

        ii. How the board will monitor compliance with the action plans required in subsection (4) of this section and the consequences if programs do not make sufficient progress on their action plans.
