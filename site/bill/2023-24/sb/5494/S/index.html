<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that railroads play a crucial role in economic development, serving nearly every industrial, wholesale, retail, and resource-based sector in Washington's economy. The legislature further finds that freight railroad infrastructure is an essential link in the supply chain and provides an efficient way to connect Washington's economy to national and international markets. The legislature further finds that maintenance and improvements to the railroad system are needed to support modern 286,000 pound railcars, foster economic development, increase infrastructure resiliency, avoid supply chain disturbances, and meet carbon reduction goals for transportation greenhouse gases. The legislature intends to provide incentives to the rail industry that can lead to a more effective short line rail system.</p>
