<p>Any other conditions affecting the orderly marketing of livestock.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of a severe weather-related event, natural disaster, or a sale requested by a bank, a licensee shall apply to the director in writing no less than five business days prior to such proposed sale. Each application must be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any case that a licensee fails to conduct sales on the sales days allocated to the licensee, the director shall, subsequent to a hearing, be authorized to revoke an allocation for nonuse. The rate of usage required to maintain an allocation shall be established by rule.</p>
