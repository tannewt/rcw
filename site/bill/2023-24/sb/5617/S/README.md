## Section 1
1. An interdistrict cooperative agreement between all participating school districts in a skill center under RCW 28A.245.010 must stipulate that any course equivalencies approved under RCW 28A.700.070 or adopted local course equivalencies approved by the host district must be honored by other participating school districts.

2. The list of approved local and state equivalency courses must be provided to participating districts on an annual basis by September 1st.

3. Students served at any core, branch, or satellite skill center campus must have access to academic credit for any approved local or state equivalency courses following transcription requirements as outlined in RCW 28A.230.097.

## Section 2
1. Each high school or school district board of directors shall adopt course equivalencies for career and technical high school courses offered to students in high schools and skill centers. A career and technical course equivalency may be for whole or partial credit. Each school district board of directors shall develop a course equivalency approval procedure. Boards of directors must approve AP computer science courses as equivalent to high school mathematics or science, and must denote on a student's transcript that AP computer science qualifies as a math-based quantitative course for students who take the course in their senior year.

2. Until September 1, 2021, a school district board of directors must, at a minimum, grant academic course equivalency for at least one statewide equivalency high school career and technical course from the list of courses approved by the superintendent of public instruction under RCW 28A.700.070.

3. [Empty]

    a. If the list of courses is revised after the 2015-16 school year, the school district board of directors must grant academic course equivalency based on the revised list beginning with the school year immediately following the revision.

    b. Each high school or school district board of directors may additionally adopt local course equivalencies for career and technical education courses that are not on the list of courses approved by the superintendent of public instruction under RCW 28A.700.070 as local equivalency courses in support of RCW 28A.700.070.

    c. Approved local or state equivalency courses at any core, branch, or satellite skill center must be offered for academic credit for all enrolled students from participating districts.

4. On and after September 1, 2021, any statewide equivalency course offered by a school district or accessed at a skill center must be offered for academic credit.

5. Career and technical courses determined to be equivalent to academic core courses, in full or in part, by the high school or school district shall be accepted as meeting core requirements, including graduation requirements, if the courses are recorded on the student's transcript using the equivalent academic high school department designation and title. Full or partial credit shall be recorded as appropriate. The high school or school district shall also issue and keep record of course completion certificates that demonstrate that the career and technical courses were successfully completed as needed for industry certification, college credit, or preapprenticeship, as applicable. The certificate shall be part of the student's high school and beyond plan. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall develop and make available electronic samples of certificates of course completion.

6. Prior to course scheduling or course registration for the next school term, each public school that serves students in any grades nine through 12 must notify all students and their parents or legal guardians of the opportunities that exist for students to meet credit-based graduation requirements through equivalency courses, including those available within the school district or at a skill center.

## Section 3
1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must create methodologies for implementing equivalency crediting on a broader scale across the state and facilitate its implementation including, but not limited to, the following:

    a. Implementing statewide career and technical education course equivalency frameworks authorized under RCW 28A.700.070 and 28A.230.097 for high schools and skill centers . This may include development of additional equivalency course frameworks in core subject areas, course performance assessments, and development and delivery of professional development for districts and skill centers implementing the career and technical education frameworks;

    b. Providing competitive grant funds to school districts to increase the integration and rigor of academic instruction in career and technical education equivalency courses. The grant funds must be used to support teams of general education and career and technical education teachers to convene and design course performance assessments, deepen the understanding of integrating academic and career and technical education in student instruction, and develop professional learning modules for school districts to plan implementation of equivalency crediting; and

    c. Conducting a review of implementation requirements of RCW 28A.230.097 and providing technical assistance to districts to ensure state course equivalencies are being consistently offered for academic credit for students at high schools and skill centers.

2. Beginning in the 2017-18 school year, school districts shall annually report to the office of the superintendent of public instruction the following information:

    a. The annual number of students participating in state-approved equivalency courses; and

    b. The annual number of state approved equivalency credit courses offered in school districts and skill centers.

3. Beginning December 1, 2018, and every December 1st thereafter, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall annually submit the following information to the office of the governor, the state board of education, and the appropriate committees of the legislature:
