## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that many children and students struggle with mental health, substance use, and behavioral health challenges that impact their ability to engage in learning and develop pathways to wellness and success. The mental and behavioral health crisis for children and youth in the United States has reached a critical point. The legislature also recognizes that behavioral health and wellness supports for K-12 students in Washington are fragmented, with roles and responsibilities assigned across several local and state agencies. The department of health, the Washington state health care authority, and the office of the superintendent of public instruction all play significant but distinct roles, as do regional educational service districts, local school districts, and community partners. Nonetheless, schools are a natural setting for prevention and early intervention efforts and provide aftercare and ongoing support because they are often a hub of the community where youth reside.

The legislature also recognizes the investments made to support student behavioral health and well-being and that despite those investments, school districts lack the dedicated funding and coordinated supports necessary to deploy comprehensive supports and direct services across the behavioral health continuum for their students.

Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create a statewide network for student mental and behavioral health to maintain, expand, and provide oversight to Washington's school-based mental and behavioral health system for children and adolescents across the state.

## Section 2

Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall provide state-level coordination to help schools better identify and connect students to behavioral health supports in school and interconnected community settings.

2. At minimum, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall, collaborate with the Washington association of educational service districts and other state agencies, including the health care authority, the department of health, and the department of children, youth, and families to:
