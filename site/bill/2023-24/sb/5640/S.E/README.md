    c. Conduct an analysis of the barriers and issues regarding contracted services that may not be resolved through the current appeals process for residential landlord-tenant policies as referenced in chapter 59.18 RCW; and

    d. Develop recommendations for a process for nonresidents residing in an assisted living facility to resolve problems, including recommendations protecting nonresidents from retaliation from owners and management of assisted living facilities.

    h. Three representatives who are current nonresidents residing in an assisted living facility, appointed by the secretary of the department of social and health services based on the recommendations of the dementia action collaborative, the office of the state long-term care ombuds, and the independent resident commission of Bonaventure of Lacey.
