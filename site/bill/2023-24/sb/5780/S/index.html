<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the lack of availability of public defense attorneys and deputy prosecutors is an increasing problem in Washington and neighboring states which threatens the ability of court systems to process criminal filings, particularly within rural areas. The legislature intends to encourage law students to enter public defense practice and prosecution and to remove barriers to practice in underserved areas and rural areas of the state.</p>

The program must allow the intern to gain real-world public defense experience under the mentorship of the experienced public defense attorney, including active representation and litigation opportunities, with the purpose of encouraging the intern to consider, or not be deterred from pursuing, employment opportunities in public defense in underserved areas and rural areas of Washington state. The internship may be structured to correspond with time periods relevant to the academic calendar.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to appropriations, a law school loan repayment program for public defenders and prosecutors is established at the Washington state department of commerce.

</li>
<li>
<p>To qualify for the law school loan repayment program, the applicant must be an attorney licensed in Washington and practicing full-time in public defense or as a prosecutor in Washington. Full-time is defined as at least 30 hours per week for a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants in the program must make a commitment to maintain employment for at least three years in one or more qualifying positions as a public defender or prosecuting attorney. The participant must fulfill this commitment within five years of entry into the program. The director may extend this five-year period for good cause, or waive the three-year commitment if family or medical circumstances prevent the applicant's continuing employment as a public defender or prosecutor. Loan repayment assistance shall be provided on a monthly basis unless less frequent disbursements are requested by the applicant. The director shall require the participant to immediately inform the director of a change in the participant's qualifying employment and may require verification at reasonable intervals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A program participant must be required to repay 100 percent of loan repayment funds disbursed during a month or other period in which the participant does not maintain qualifying employment. A participant who does not complete the three-year commitment to maintain employment in one or more qualifying positions as a public defender or prosecuting attorney, and who is not excused wholly or partially from repayment by the director for good cause, shall otherwise be required to repay:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>75 percent of loan repayment funds received if the participant completes less than one year of the three-year commitment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 percent of loan repayment funds received if the participant completes at least one year but less than two years of the three-year commitment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25 percent of loan repayment funds received if the participant completes at least two years but less than three years of the three-year commitment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may establish reasonable terms for repayment, including charging a reasonable rate of interest commencing when the repayment obligation is triggered or voluntarily assumed by the participant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An individual may continue to participate in the law school loan repayment program for public defenders and prosecutors after the individual has fulfilled the three-year commitment to maintain qualifying employment. The maximum repayment assistance an individual may receive through the program is $20,000 per year up to a lifetime cap of $120,000 per participant.</p>
</li>
<li>
