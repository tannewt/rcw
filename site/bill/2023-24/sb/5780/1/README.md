# SB 5780 - Public defense training

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5780.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that the current generation entering the public defense profession seeks comprehensive training and mentorship. Training and peer support are needed to build the confidence and skills necessary to establish and maintain public defense careers, particularly in rural and underserved areas. However, training offered by local public defense programs varies, and rural and less-populated jurisdictions may lack the resources to conduct in-house training programs. High quality national training programs are inaccessible to many due to high costs and the time commitment required to attend. The legislature finds that it can encourage participation and longevity in public defense practice by funding the office of public defense to expand its criminal defense training academy program to serve as a statewide training resource for both new public defense practitioners and those seeking to achieve advanced qualifications.

## Section 2
Subject to appropriations, the office of public defense shall expand the capacity of its criminal defense training academy program to train practitioners who are new to public defense. The program must include and prioritize training for practitioners in underserved areas and rural areas of the state. The program must offer intensive trial skill development, incorporate public defense best practices and applicable standards, and offer networking opportunities. Trainings may incorporate in-person, remote, and recorded resources. By June 30, 2026, the office of public defense shall expand program offerings to also provide training to public defense practitioners who are seeking to achieve advanced qualifications.
