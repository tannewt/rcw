# SB 6256 - Solar consumer protections

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6256.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that many residential and commercial property owners are solicited by solar energy salespersons and solar energy contractors to purchase or lease a system producing electricity with solar energy. Salespeople and contractors are responsible for accurately representing the financing terms, total cost, and performance of the solar energy equipment to support the residential or commercial property owner in making an informed decision about whether the installation is economically viable. If these terms are not communicated correctly, property owners face financial hardship. The legislature declares that this is a matter of public interest. It is the intent of the legislature to establish rules of business practice for solar energy contractors and solar energy salespersons to promote honesty and fair dealing with homeowners and other property owners.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Dealer fee" means an amount paid by a solar energy contractor or solar energy salesperson to a lender in order to offer a property owner credit to finance the purchase and installation of a system producing electricity with solar energy.

2. "Electric utility" means any entity that is engaged in the business of distributing electricity to retail electric customers in the state.

3. "Major system components" means any inverters, module-level power electronics, solar panels, racking systems, or battery energy storage equipment included in the solar energy installation.

4. "Net metering" means measuring the difference between the electricity supplied by an electric utility and the excess electricity generated by a customer-generator's net metering system over the applicable billing period.

5. "Person" includes an individual, corporation, company, partnership, joint venture, or business entity.

6. "Solar array" means a mechanically and electrically integrated grouping of modules with support structure, including any attached system components such as inverters or dc-to-dc converters and attached associated wiring.

1. Any person selling or installing residential or commercial systems producing electricity with solar energy for a total cost including labor and materials in excess of $1,000 must be licensed under RCW 19.28.041 and have a solar energy installation contract with the customer consistent with this section. This section does not apply to any person installing residential or commercial solar energy systems on the person's own property who is properly exempted under RCW 19.28.261.

2. A solar energy installation contract must be in writing and must be written in the same language as was principally used in the sales presentation made to the consumer, including any print or digital marketing material given to the customer. A copy of the contract must be given to the customer at the time the customer signs the contract. The contract must be typed or printed legibly and contain the following provisions:

    a. An itemized list of work to be performed including any known or anticipated electrical system upgrades or utility equipment upgrades that are necessary for installation;

    b. Any financing that is incorporated directly into the contract, which must be identified as a separate line item and conform to all state and federal consumer loan regulations and disclosure requirements, including terms, conditions, interest rates, annual percentage rate, the amortization schedule, and information on how the loan is secured;

    c. Disclosure of the exact amount paid, if any, by a solar energy contractor or solar energy salesperson to any lender in the form of a dealer fee, or other similar inducement to obtain financing, irrespective of whether financing is incorporated within the contract or in conjunction with a third-party lender;

A statement clearly explaining whether the solar energy installation contract includes the cost of uninstalling and reinstalling the solar energy system if it is installed on the customer's roof and the roof must be replaced or repaired at a future date. If the contract does not include the future cost of uninstalling and reinstalling the solar energy system to be installed on the customer's roof, the contract must include the following notice which must be initialed by the customer acknowledging they have read and understand the notice provision:

"If you need to repair or replace your roof, you will be responsible for all costs and work needed to uninstall and reinstall the solar energy system and interconnect it with your utility company.";

    t. The following notice which must be initialed by the customer acknowledging they have read and understand the notice provision:

"If you are a residential customer, you must have sufficient tax liability to utilize the residential clean energy credit. You will not receive these funds directly; you can only offset the taxes that you owe to the federal government. IF YOU ARE PARTICIPATING IN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OR ARE ON A FIXED INCOME, YOU MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS TAX CREDIT. The cost of roof repairs should not be included in calculating the tax credit. It is recommended that you consult a tax attorney if you are relying on the tax credit to afford the cost of the solar energy installation.";

    u. A copy of the internal revenue service's current revision of form 5695 instructions for residential clean energy credit (part I) qualified solar electric property costs;

    x. A statement documenting which party is responsible for obtaining permission to operate from the utility;

    y. A statement that the addition of a solar energy system may affect the value of the structure as determined by the county assessor and any change in value may be reflected in annual property taxes; and

    z. The following statement which may be omitted if the solar energy system includes energy storage equipment and/or power conversion and control technologies designed and installed to provide backup power during a grid outage:

"A solar energy system will automatically disconnect the solar energy system from the utility grid in the event of a power outage to protect utility repair personnel from a risk of electric shock from the electricity that could otherwise flow into the utility distribution system from the solar energy system and that if this occurs, THE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY ELECTRICITY TO THE CUSTOMER DURING THE POWER OUTAGE."

3. If a customer exercises the rescission rights described in subsection (2)(r) of this section, the solar energy contractor or the subcontractor may not enforce the terms of the contract, including claims for labor or materials, in a court of law and must terminate any security interest or statutory lien created under the transaction within 20 days of receiving written rescission of the contract from the customer. This subsection also applies if the customer has made a good faith effort to contact the solar energy contractor before the customer's rescission rights have expired. If a customer demonstrates an effort to contact the solar energy contractor within the rescission rights window, even if the solar energy contractor has not responded, the solar energy contractor is prohibited from enforcing the terms of the contract and must not charge any cancellation fees.

4. No payments of any type may be charged by a solar energy salesperson or a solar energy contractor before a customer's rescission rights have expired.

5. The interconnection application for the solar energy system must be approved by the applicable electric utility before the solar energy contractor or the subcontractor begins installing the system. The applicable electric utility may waive this requirement for solar energy contractors that are certified by the electric utility.

6. It is the solar energy contractor's responsibility to notify the applicable electric utility of any equipment or design changes that occur.

7. If the solar energy installation contract is with a residential customer, and the contract's scope includes any type of roofing work, the solar energy contractor shall provide the customer separate invoices for the roofing work, and the contract must separately itemize and identify the cost of roofing tear-off and replacement.

8. A person or entity who purchases or is otherwise assigned a solar energy installation contract is subject to all claims and defenses with respect to the contract that the customer could assert against the solar energy contractor or subcontractor. A person or entity who sells or otherwise assigns a solar energy installation contract must include a prominent notice of the potential liability under this section.

9. A solar energy contractor, subcontractor, or solar energy salesperson who fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter is liable to the customer for any actual damages sustained by the customer as a result of the failure. Nothing in this section limits any cause of action or remedy available under chapter 19.86 RCW.

## Section 4
No person may solicit using any statement or representation with regard to the costs, financing, terms, or conditions of purchase or installation of residential or commercial systems producing electricity with solar energy that is deceptive.

## Section 5
The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for purposes of applying the consumer protection act as set forth under chapter 19.86 RCW.

## Section 6
Any person selling or installing residential or commercial systems producing electricity with solar energy for a total cost including labor and materials in excess of $1,000 must be licensed under RCW 19.28.041 and must offer a contract pursuant to section 3 of this act.
