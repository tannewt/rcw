<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that many residential and commercial property owners are solicited by solar energy salespersons and solar energy contractors to purchase or lease a system producing electricity with solar energy. Salespeople and contractors are responsible for accurately representing the financing terms, total cost, and performance of the solar energy equipment to support the residential or commercial property owner in making an informed decision about whether the installation is economically viable. If these terms are not communicated correctly, property owners face financial hardship. The legislature declares that this is a matter of public interest. It is the intent of the legislature to establish rules of business practice for solar energy contractors and solar energy salespersons to promote honesty and fair dealing with homeowners and other property owners.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;IF YOU INTEND TO OBTAIN A LOAN TO PAY FOR ALL OR PART OF THE CONTRACT, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU WAIT UNTIL RECEIVING FINANCIAL APPROVAL BEFORE SIGNING THIS SOLAR ENERGY INSTALLATION CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, IF YOU INTEND TO OBTAIN A LOAN TO PAY FOR ALL OR PART OF THE CONTRACT, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU VERIFY WHETHER LOAN PAYMENTS ARE DUE BEFORE THE SYSTEM IS OPERATIONAL. NOTHING IN THIS CONTRACT ALTERS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY YOUR ELECTRIC UTILITY COMPANY FOR AMOUNTS DUE ON YOUR ELECTRIC BILL.&quot;;</p>
<pre><code>r. The following rescission rights notice in capital letters, which must be initialed by the customer acknowledging they have read and understand the notice provision:
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;CUSTOMER'S RIGHT TO CANCEL: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL YOUR SOLAR ENERGY INSTALLATION CONTRACT WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS OF CONTRACT SIGNING.&quot;;</p>
<pre><code>s. A statement clearly explaining whether the solar energy installation contract includes the cost of uninstalling and reinstalling the solar energy system if it is installed on the customer's roof and the roof must be replaced or repaired at a future date. If the contract does not include the future cost of uninstalling and reinstalling the solar energy system to be installed on the customer's roof, the contract must include the following notice which must be initialed by the customer acknowledging they have read and understand the notice provision:
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;If you need to repair or replace your roof, you will be responsible for all costs and work needed to uninstall and reinstall the solar energy system and interconnect it with your utility company.&quot;;</p>
<pre><code>t. The following notice which must be initialed by the customer acknowledging they have read and understand the notice provision:
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;If you are a residential customer, you must have sufficient tax liability to utilize the residential clean energy credit. You will not receive these funds directly; you can only offset the taxes that you owe to the federal government. IF YOU ARE PARTICIPATING IN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OR ARE ON A FIXED INCOME, YOU MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS TAX CREDIT. The cost of roof repairs should not be included in calculating the tax credit. It is recommended that you consult a tax attorney if you are relying on the tax credit to afford the cost of the solar energy installation.&quot;;</p>
<pre><code>u. A copy of the internal revenue service's current revision of form 5695 instructions for residential clean energy credit (part I) qualified solar electric property costs;

v. A statement that it is the solar energy contractor's responsibility to install the system per manufacturer instructions, in compliance with the national electric code as enforced by the local jurisdiction, in compliance with local building codes, and in compliance with the applicable utility's interconnection standards;

w. A copy of, or electronic link to, the applicable electric utility's interconnection application;

x. A statement documenting which party is responsible for obtaining permission to operate from the utility;

z. The following statement which may be omitted if the solar energy system includes energy storage equipment and/or power conversion and control technologies designed and installed to provide backup power during a grid outage:
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;A solar energy system will automatically disconnect the solar energy system from the utility grid in the event of a power outage to protect utility repair personnel from a risk of electric shock from the electricity that could otherwise flow into the utility distribution system from the solar energy system and that if this occurs, THE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY ELECTRICITY TO THE CUSTOMER DURING THE POWER OUTAGE.&quot;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>If a customer exercises the rescission rights described in subsection (2)(r) of this section, the solar energy contractor or the subcontractor may not enforce the terms of the contract, including claims for labor or materials, in a court of law and must terminate any security interest or statutory lien created under the transaction within 20 days of receiving written rescission of the contract from the customer. This subsection also applies if the customer has made a good faith effort to contact the solar energy contractor before the customer's rescission rights have expired. If a customer demonstrates an effort to contact the solar energy contractor within the rescission rights window, even if the solar energy contractor has not responded, the solar energy contractor is prohibited from enforcing the terms of the contract and must not charge any cancellation fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No payments of any type may be charged by a solar energy salesperson or a solar energy contractor before a customer's rescission rights have expired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interconnection application for the solar energy system must be approved by the applicable electric utility before the solar energy contractor or the subcontractor begins installing the system. The applicable electric utility may waive this requirement for solar energy contractors that are certified by the electric utility.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A person or entity who purchases or is otherwise assigned a solar energy installation contract is subject to all claims and defenses with respect to the contract that the customer could assert against the solar energy contractor or subcontractor. A person or entity who sells or otherwise assigns a solar energy installation contract must include a prominent notice of the potential liability under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A solar energy contractor, subcontractor, or solar energy salesperson who fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter is liable to the customer for any actual damages sustained by the customer as a result of the failure. Nothing in this section limits any cause of action or remedy available under chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>No person may solicit using any statement or representation with regard to the costs, financing, terms, or conditions of purchase or installation of residential or commercial systems producing electricity with solar energy that is deceptive.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for purposes of applying the consumer protection act as set forth under chapter 19.86 RCW.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any person selling or installing residential or commercial systems producing electricity with solar energy for a total cost including labor and materials in excess of $1,000 must be licensed under RCW 19.28.041 and must offer a contract pursuant to section 3 of this act.</p>
