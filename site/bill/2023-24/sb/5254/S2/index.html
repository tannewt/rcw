<p>Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, and subject to other provisions of this chapter and subject to rules adopted by the board, the department may lease state lands for purposes it deems advisable, including, but not limited to, commercial, industrial, residential, agricultural, and recreational purposes in order to obtain a fair market rental return to the state or the appropriate constitutional or statutory trust, and if the lease is in the best interest of the state or affected trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, in leases for residential purposes, the board may waive or modify any conditions of the lease if the waiver or modification is necessary to enable any federal agency or lending institution authorized to do business in this state or elsewhere in the United States to participate in any loan secured by a security interest in a leasehold interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any land granted to the state by the United States may be leased for any lawful purpose in such minimum acreage as may be fixed by the department.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall exercise general supervision and control over the lease of state lands for any lawful purpose.</p>
