    b. Facilities that directly reduce adverse environmental and public health stressors in the pollution burdened community may be considered as serving an essential environmental, health, or safety need of the individuals in an overburdened community.

    c. The lead agency may consider, as relevant, public input as to whether a compelling public interest is demonstrated if there is a significant degree of public interest in favor of or against an application from individuals residing in the pollution burdened community. In addition to any other public comment provided pursuant to this chapter, the lead agency may seek input from the public whenever it determines that such comments may clarify whether the compelling public interest standard is met.

All feasible off-site measures within the pollution burdened community to reduce adverse environmental and public health stressors to which the potentially impactful project will not contribute, with preference for the reduction of stressors from highest to lowest percentile in relation to the geographic point of comparison; and

    v. All feasible off-site measures within the pollution burdened community to provide a net environmental benefit in the overburdened community.

## Section 6
1. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the analysis and measures required in sections 3 and 4 of this act, a project proponent for the renewal of an existing permit that is to be located, in whole or in part, in a pollution burdened community that is subject to adverse cumulative stressors shall analyze and propose feasible control measures necessary to avoid potentially impactful project contributions to all adverse environmental and public health stressors in the pollution burdened community. Where the control measures proposed by the project proponent will prevent a disproportionate impact by avoiding potentially impactful project contributions to all adverse environmental and public health stressors in the pollution burdened community, the lead agency may approve the proposed action in accordance with RCW 43.21C.060.

    b. Where the control measures proposed by the project proponent cannot avoid a disproportionate impact, the department of ecology may impose conditions in accordance with RCW 43.21C.060.

2. As part of its environmental justice impact statement, a proponent of a potentially impactful project's permit renewal subject to this section shall submit a potentially impactful project-wide risk assessment that evaluates existing source operations.
