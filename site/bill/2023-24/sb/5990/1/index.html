<p>Following the completion of the public participation process detailed in section 2 of this act, the lead agency shall consider the environmental justice impact statement, and any supplemental information, testimony, written comments, the project proponent's response to comments, and any other information deemed relevant by the lead agency to determine whether the potentially impactful project can avoid a disproportionate impact, determine whether to deny or approve the proposed action, and evaluate whether and how to impose conditions concerning the construction and operation of the potentially impactful project to address its contributions to environmental and public health stressors affecting the pollution burdened community.</p>
