<ol>
<li>
<p>Supermarkets and other grocery retailers are the primary points of distribution for food and other daily necessities for the residents of Washington and are therefore essential to the vitality of every Washington community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state has a compelling interest in ensuring the welfare of the residents of its communities through the maintenance of health and safety standards in grocery establishments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experienced grocery retail workers with knowledge of proper sanitation procedures, health regulations and laws, and an experience-based understanding of the clientele and communities in which the retailer is located are essential in furthering this interest and the state's investments in health and safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transitional retention period for grocery retail workers upon change of ownership, control, or operation of grocery stores ensures stability throughout the state for these vital workers, which, in turn, results in preservation of health and safety standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
