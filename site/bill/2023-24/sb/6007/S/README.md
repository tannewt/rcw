[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6007-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Supermarkets and other grocery retailers are the primary points of distribution for food and other daily necessities for the residents of Washington and are therefore essential to the vitality of every Washington community.

2. The state has a compelling interest in ensuring the welfare of the residents of its communities through the maintenance of health and safety standards in grocery establishments.

3. Experienced grocery retail workers with knowledge of proper sanitation procedures, health regulations and laws, and an experience-based understanding of the clientele and communities in which the retailer is located are essential in furthering this interest and the state's investments in health and safety.

4. A transitional retention period for grocery retail workers upon change of ownership, control, or operation of grocery stores ensures stability throughout the state for these vital workers, which, in turn, results in preservation of health and safety standards.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Change in control" means any sale, purchase, assignment, acquisition, transfer, contribution, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets, cash on hand, or a controlling interest, including by consolidation, merger, or reorganization, of or by the incumbent grocery employer or any person who controls the incumbent grocery employer or any grocery establishment under the operation or control of either the incumbent grocery employer or any person who controls the incumbent grocery employer.

2. "Eligible grocery worker" means any individual whose primary place of employment is at the grocery establishment subject to a change in control, and who has worked for the incumbent grocery employer for at least six months prior to the execution of the transfer document. "Eligible grocery worker" does not include a managerial, supervisory, or confidential employee.

3. "Employment commencement date" means the date on which an eligible grocery worker retained by the successor grocery employer pursuant to this chapter commences work for the successor grocery employer in exchange for benefits and compensation under the terms and conditions established by the successor grocery employer and as required by law.

Other household supplies or other products must be secondary to the primary purpose of food sales.

    b. A distribution center owned and operated by a grocery establishment and used primarily to distribute goods to or from its owned stores is considered a grocery establishment, regardless of its square footage.

## Section 3

If the eligible grocery worker's performance during the 180-day transition employment period is satisfactory, the successor grocery employer must consider offering the eligible grocery worker continued employment under the terms and conditions established by the successor grocery employer and as required by law. The successor grocery employer must retain a record of the written performance evaluation for at least three years.
