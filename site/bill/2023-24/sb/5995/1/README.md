# SB 5995 - Creating a professional license for spoken language interpreters and translators.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5995.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the United States census reported that between 2015 and 2019, over 1.5 million Washington state residents over the age of five, approximately 20 percent of the state's population, spoke a language other than English at home, and that in 2019, according to the Washington state office of the superintendent of public instruction, 12 percent of the state's total primary and secondary education student population identified as English learners.

2. The legislature finds that an inadequate number of individuals available to provide interpreting services to injured workers and medicaid enrollees with limited English proficiency potentially increases the liability risks for health care providers and negative health outcomes for these patients.

3. The legislature finds that businesses and government agencies across Washington need access to professional language services to ensure their customers and clients with limited English proficiency can have meaningful access to participate in the programs, activities, and services offered by businesses and government agencies.

4. Therefore, the legislature intends to create a professional licensing program for spoken language interpreters and translators to protect consumers and help meet the needs of all Washingtonians who require interpreting and translating services.
