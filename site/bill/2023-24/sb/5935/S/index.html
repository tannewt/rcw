</li>
<li>
<p>Agreements limiting competition or hiring may be contracts of adhesion that may be unreasonable; and</p>

<p>The provisions in this chapter facilitating workforce mobility and protecting employees and independent contractors need to be liberally construed and exceptions narrowly construed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Unless the employer discloses the terms of the covenant in writing to the prospective employee no later than the time of the initial oral or written acceptance of the offer of employment and, if the agreement becomes enforceable only at a later date due to changes in the employee's compensation, the employer specifically discloses that the agreement may be enforceable against the employee in the future; or</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court or arbitrator must presume that any noncompetition covenant with a duration exceeding eighteen months after termination of employment is unreasonable and unenforceable. A party seeking enforcement may rebut the presumption by proving by clear and convincing evidence that a duration longer than eighteen months is necessary to protect the party's business or goodwill.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If the covenant requires the employee or independent contractor to adjudicate a noncompetition covenant outside of this state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent it deprives the employee or independent contractor of the protections or benefits of this chapter; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it allows or requires the application of choice of law principles or the substantive law of any jurisdiction other than Washington state.</p>
