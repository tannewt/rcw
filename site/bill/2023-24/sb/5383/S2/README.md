## Section 1
1. [Empty]

    a. The driver of any vehicle, a person operating a bicycle, and every pedestrian shall obey, and the operation of every personal delivery device shall follow, the instructions of any official traffic control device applicable thereto, and as specified in this chapter, placed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or police officer, subject to the exception granted the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle in this chapter.

    b. On a roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour or less, a police officer may only stop a pedestrian for a violation of this subsection if the pedestrian is in violation of RCW 46.61.235(2). This subsection (1)(b) does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of exercising due care for the pedestrian's safety or relieve a driver of a vehicle from the duty of exercising due care for the safety of any pedestrian within the roadway.

2. No provision of this chapter for which official traffic control devices are required shall be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged violation an official device is not in proper position and sufficiently legible or visible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section does not state that official traffic control devices are required, such section shall be effective even though no devices are erected or in place.

3. Whenever official traffic control devices are placed in position approximately conforming to the requirements of this chapter, such devices shall be presumed to have been so placed by the official act or direction of lawful authority, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence.

4. Any official traffic control device placed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and purporting to conform to the lawful requirements pertaining to such devices shall be presumed to comply with the requirements of this chapter, unless the contrary shall be established by competent evidence.

## Section 2
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word or legend, and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles, pedestrians, and personal delivery devices, as follows:

1. Green indication

    a. Vehicle operators facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. Vehicle operators turning right or left shall stop to allow other vehicles lawfully within the intersection control area to complete their movements. Vehicle operators turning right or left shall also stop for pedestrians who or personal delivery devices that are lawfully within the intersection control area as required by RCW 46.61.235(1).

    b. Vehicle operators facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may enter the intersection control area only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Vehicle operators shall stop to allow other vehicles lawfully within the intersection control area to complete their movements. Vehicle operators shall also stop for pedestrians who or personal delivery devices that are lawfully within the intersection control area as required by RCW 46.61.235(1).

    c. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in RCW 46.61.060 , pedestrians or personal delivery devices facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.

2. Steady yellow indication

    a. Vehicle operators facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal are thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. Vehicle operators shall stop for pedestrians who or personal delivery devices that are lawfully within the intersection control area as required by RCW 46.61.235(1).

On a roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour or less, a police officer may only stop a pedestrian for a violation of (b)(i) of this subsection if the pedestrian is in violation of RCW 46.61.235(2). This subsection (2)(b)(ii) does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of exercising due care for the pedestrian's safety or relieve a driver of a vehicle from the duty of exercising due care for the safety of any pedestrian within the roadway.

3. Steady red indication

    a. Vehicle operators facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection control area and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. However, the vehicle operators facing a steady circular red signal may, after stopping proceed to make a right turn from a one-way or two-way street into a two-way street or into a one-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the right turn; or a left turn from a one-way or two-way street into a one-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn; unless a sign posted by competent authority prohibits such movement. Vehicle operators planning to make such turns shall remain stopped to allow other vehicles lawfully within or approaching the intersection control area to complete their movements. Vehicle operators planning to make such turns shall also remain stopped for pedestrians who or personal delivery devices that are lawfully within the intersection control area as required by RCW 46.61.235(1).

    b. [Empty]

        i. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in RCW 46.61.060 , pedestrians or personal delivery devices facing a steady circular red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.

On a roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour or less, a police officer may only stop a pedestrian for a violation of (b)(i) of this subsection if the pedestrian is in violation of RCW 46.61.235(2). This subsection (3)(b)(ii) does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of exercising due care for the pedestrian's safety or relieve a driver of a vehicle from the duty of exercising due care for the safety of any pedestrian within the roadway.

    c. Vehicle operators facing a steady red arrow indication may not enter the intersection control area to make the movement indicated by such arrow, and unless entering the intersection control area to make such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering a crosswalk on the near side of the intersection control area, or if none, then before entering the intersection control area and shall remain standing until an indication to make the movement indicated by such arrow is shown. However, the vehicle operators facing a steady red arrow indication may, after stopping proceed to make a right turn from a one-way or two-way street into a two-way street or into a one-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the right turn; or a left turn from a one-way street or two-way street into a one-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn; unless a sign posted by competent authority prohibits such movement. Vehicle operators planning to make such turns shall remain stopped to allow other vehicles lawfully within or approaching the intersection control area to complete their movements. Vehicle operators planning to make such turns shall also remain stopped for pedestrians who or personal delivery devices that are lawfully within the intersection control area as required by RCW 46.61.235(1).

4. If an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

## Section 3
Whenever pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "Walk" or the walking person symbol or "Don't Walk" or the hand symbol are operating, the signals shall indicate as follows:

1. WALK or walking person symbolPedestrians or personal delivery devices facing such signal may cross the roadway in the direction of the signal. Vehicle operators shall stop for pedestrians who or personal delivery devices that are lawfully moving within the intersection control area on such signal as required by RCW 46.61.235(1).

2. [Empty]

    a. Steady or flashing DON'T WALK or hand symbolPedestrians or personal delivery devices facing such signal shall not enter the roadway.

    b. On a roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour or less, a police officer may only stop a pedestrian for a violation of (a) of this subsection if the pedestrian is in violation of RCW 46.61.235(2). This subsection does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of exercising due care for the pedestrian's safety or relieve a driver of a vehicle from the duty of exercising due care for the safety of any pedestrian within the roadway.

    c. Vehicle operators shall stop for pedestrians who or personal delivery devices that have begun to cross the roadway before the display of either signal as required by RCW 46.61.235(1).

3. Pedestrian control signals having the "Wait" legend in use on August 6, 1965, shall be deemed authorized signals and shall indicate the same as the "Don't Walk" legend. Whenever such pedestrian control signals are replaced the legend "Wait" shall be replaced by the legend "Don't Walk" or the hand symbol.

## Section 4
Pedestrians shall be subject to traffic-control signals at intersections as provided in RCW 46.61.060, and at all other places pedestrians shall be accorded the privileges and shall be subject to the restrictions stated in this chapter. On a roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour or less, a police officer may only stop a pedestrian for a violation of this section if the pedestrian is in violation of RCW 46.61.235(2). This section does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of exercising due care for the pedestrian's safety or relieve a driver of a vehicle from the duty of exercising due care for the safety of any pedestrian within the roadway.

## Section 5
1. The operator of an approaching vehicle shall stop and remain stopped to allow a pedestrian, bicycle, or personal delivery device to cross the roadway within an unmarked or marked crosswalk when the pedestrian, bicycle, or personal delivery device is upon or within one lane of the half of the roadway upon which the vehicle is traveling or onto which it is turning. For purposes of this section "half of the roadway" means all traffic lanes carrying traffic in one direction of travel, and includes the entire width of a one-way roadway.

2. No pedestrian, bicycle, or personal delivery device shall suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk, run, or otherwise move into the path of a vehicle or municipal transit vehicle that is so close that it is impossible for the driver or operator to stop.
