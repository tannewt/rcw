<ol>
<li>
<p>All real property is exempt from state and local property taxes if owned by :</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A nonprofit entity, or  a qualified cooperative association, for the purpose of developing or redeveloping on the real property one or more residences to be sold to low-income households including land to be leased as provided in subsection (9)(f)(ii) of this section; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nonprofit entity for the purpose of selling the real property to a low-income household who enters into an agreement with the nonprofit to build, or have built, through a qualified mutual self-help housing program a residence on the real property.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exemption provided in this section expires on or at the earlier of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>(i) For purposes of the exemption provided in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the date on which the nonprofit entity transfers title to the single-family dwelling unit or the date on which the qualified cooperative association first conveys, directly or indirectly through the transfer of an ownership interest in the association, any single-family dwelling unit on the property or any part of the property; or</p>
<ol type="i" start="2">
<li>For purposes of the exemption provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section, the date on which the nonprofit entity transfers title to the real property to the low-income household;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date on which the nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association executes a lease of land described in subsection (9)(f)(ii) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end of the seventh consecutive property tax year for which the property is granted an exemption under this section or, if the nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association has claimed an extension under subsection (4) of this section, the end of the tenth consecutive property tax year for which the property is granted an exemption under this section; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The property is no longer held for the purpose for which the exemption was granted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exemption under this section does not expire as a consequence of the real property being transferred by one nonprofit entity to another nonprofit entity or to a qualified cooperative association so long as the transferee timely applies to the department and is approved for a continuation of the exemption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the nonprofit entity believes that title to the single-family dwelling unit, or title of the real property exempt under subsection (1)(b) of this section, will not be transferred by the end of the sixth consecutive property tax year or if a qualified cooperative association believes that neither a single-family dwelling unit nor any other part of the property will be transferred by the end of the sixth consecutive property tax year, the nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association may claim a three-year extension of the exemption period by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Filing a notice of extension with the department on or before March 31st of the sixth consecutive property tax year; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a filing fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.1 percent of the real market value of the property as of the most recent assessment date with the notice of extension. The filing fee must be deposited into the state general fund.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the nonprofit entity has not transferred title to the single-family dwelling unit to a low-income household or title to the real property exempt under subsection (1)(b) of this section to a low-income household, or if a qualified cooperative association has not transferred either a single-family dwelling unit or any other property, within the applicable period described in subsection (2)(c) of this section, or if the nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association has converted the property to a purpose other than the purpose for which the exemption was granted, the property is disqualified from the exemption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon disqualification, the county treasurer must collect an additional tax equal to all taxes that would have been paid on the property but for the existence of the exemption, plus interest at the same rate and computed in the same way as that upon delinquent property taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additional tax must be distributed by the county treasurer in the same manner in which current property taxes applicable to the subject property are distributed. The additional taxes and interest are due in full 30 days following the date on which the treasurer's statement of additional tax due is issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additional tax and interest is a lien on the property. The lien for additional tax and interest has priority to and must be fully paid and satisfied before any recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the property may become charged or liable. If a nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association sells or transfers real property subject to a lien for additional taxes under this subsection, such unpaid additional taxes must be paid by the nonprofit entity or qualified cooperative association at the time of sale or transfer. The county auditor may not accept an instrument of conveyance unless the additional tax has been paid. The nonprofit entity, qualified cooperative association, or the new owner may appeal the assessed values upon which the additional tax is based to the county board of equalization in accordance with the provisions of RCW 84.40.038.</p>
