# SB 5740 - Catalytic converter theft

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5740-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that rates of catalytic converter theft have rapidly increased statewide and nationwide, due in part to existing challenges with accurately identifying stolen catalytic converters and tracking them through the stream of commerce after they have been removed from their originating vehicles. The legislature also finds that recent evidence suggests most purchases of stolen catalytic converters are conducted by unlicensed, unregulated purchasers.

Therefore, the legislature intends to require all purchasers to be licensed and subject to regulation and inspection. The legislature also intends to create a related structure for enforcing these provisions and imposing penalties commensurate with the enforcement and penalty structures found in comparable areas of law.

## Section 2
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize licensed scrap metal businesses to purchase or sell junk vehicles or major component parts as defined in RCW 46.79.010.

## Section 3
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

## Section 4

At the time of a transaction, every scrap metal business doing business in this state shall produce wherever that business is conducted an accurate and legible record of each transaction involving  nonferrous metal property. This record must be written in the English language, documented on a standardized form or in electronic form, and contain the following information:

    a. The signature of the person with whom the transaction is made;

    b. The time, date, location, and value of the transaction;

The declaration must be signed and dated by the person with whom the transaction is being made. An employee of the scrap metal business must witness the signing and dating of the declaration and sign the declaration accordingly before any transaction may be consummated.
