## Section 2
The commission shall have the following powers and duties:

1. To authorize and issue licenses for a period not to exceed one year to bona fide charitable or nonprofit organizations approved by the commission meeting the requirements of this chapter and any rules  adopted under this chapter permitting said organizations to conduct bingo games, raffles, sweepstakes, amusement games, and social card games, to utilize punchboards and pull-tabs in accordance with  this chapter and any rules  adopted under this chapter, and to revoke or suspend said licenses for violation of  this chapter or any rules  adopted under this chapter. However, the commission shall not deny a license to an otherwise qualified applicant in an effort to limit the number of licenses to be issued. The commission or director shall not issue, deny, suspend, or revoke any license because of considerations of race, sex, creed, color, or national originand may authorize the director to temporarily issue or suspend licenses subject to final action by the commission;

2. To authorize and issue licenses for a period not to exceed one year to any person, association, or organization operating a business primarily engaged in the selling of items of food or drink for consumption on the premises, approved by the commission meeting the requirements of this chapter and any rules  adopted under this chapter permitting said person, association, or organization to utilize punchboards and pull-tabs and to conduct social card games as a commercial stimulant in accordance with  this chapter and any rules  adopted under this chapter and to revoke or suspend said licenses for violation of any provisions of this chapter and any rules  adopted under this chapter. However, the commission shall not deny a license to an otherwise qualified applicant in an effort to limit the number of licenses to be issued. The commission may authorize the director to temporarily issue or suspend licenses subject to final action by the commission;

3. To authorize and issue licenses for a period not to exceed one year to any person, association, or organization approved by the commission meeting the requirements of this chapter and meeting the requirements of any rules  adopted by the commission pursuant to this chapter , permitting said person, association, or organization to conduct or operate amusement games in such manner and at such locations as the commission may determine. The commission may authorize the director to temporarily issue or suspend licenses subject to final action by the commission;

4. To authorize, require, and issue, for a period not to exceed one year, such licenses as the commission may by rule provide, to any person, association, or organization to engage in the manufacturing, selling, distributing, or otherwise supplying of devices, equipment, software, hardware, or any gambling-related services for use within this state for those activities authorized by this chapter. The commission may authorize the director to temporarily issue or suspend licenses subject to final action by the commission;

5. To establish a schedule of annual license fees for carrying on specific gambling activities upon the premises, and for such other activities as may be licensed by the commission, which fees shall provide to the commission not less than an amount of money adequate to cover all costs incurred by the commission relative to licensing under this chapter and the enforcement by the commission of  this chapter and rules  adopted under this chapter. However, all licensing fees shall be submitted with an application therefor and such portion of said fee as the commission may determine, based upon its cost of processing and investigation, shall be retained by the commission upon the withdrawal or denial of any such license application as its reasonable expense for processing the application and investigation into the granting thereof. If, in a particular case, the basic license fee established by the commission for a particular class of license is less than the commission's actual expenses to investigate that particular application, the commission may at any time charge to that applicant such additional fees as are necessary to pay the commission for those costs. The commission may decline to proceed with its investigation and no license shall be issued until the commission has been fully paid therefor by the applicant. The commission may establish fees for the furnishing by it to licensees of identification stamps to be affixed to such devices and equipment as required by the commission and for such other special services or programs required or offered by the commission, the amount of each of these fees to be not less than is adequate to offset the cost to the commission of the stamps and of administering their dispersal to licensees or the cost of administering such other special services, requirements or programs;

The commission shall require fingerprinting and national criminal history background checks on any persons seeking licenses, certifications, or permits under this chapter or of any person holding an interest in any gambling activity, building, or equipment to be used therefor, or of any person participating as an employee in the operation of any gambling activity. All national criminal history background checks shall be conducted using fingerprints submitted to the United States department of justice-federal bureau of investigation. The commission must establish rules to delineate which persons named on the application are subject to national criminal history background checks.
