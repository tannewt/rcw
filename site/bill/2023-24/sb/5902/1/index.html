<p>Any lands owned by the state parks and recreation commission, which are determined to be surplus to the needs of the state for development for state park purposes and which the commission proposes to deed to a local government or other entity, shall be accompanied by a clause requiring that if the land is not used for outdoor recreation purposes, ownership of the land shall revert to the state parks and recreation commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state parks and recreation commission, in cases where land subject to such a reversionary clause is proposed for use or disposal for purposes other than recreation, shall require that, if the land is surplus to the needs of the commission for park purposes at the time the commission becomes aware of its proposed use for nonrecreation purposes, the holder of the land or property shall reimburse the commission for the release of the reversionary interest in the land. The reimbursement shall be in the amount of the fair market value of the reversionary interest as determined by a qualified appraiser agreeable to the commission. Appraisal costs shall be borne by the local entity which holds title to the land.</p>
