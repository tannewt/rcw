<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the Washington state liquor and cannabis board exists to promote safe communities and public safety, and that there is no state entity to oversee research and education of the state's cannabis industry.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The general welfare of the people of the state will be served by the research and development of best practices surrounding safe cultivation and processing activities of cannabis so the industry is therefore affected with the public interest; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a Washington state cannabis commission for the public purpose of administering the revenue of the commission serves the public interest by materially advancing the producing and processing of cannabis and improving sustainability in the cannabis producing and processing sectors.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>To complement the development of a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the production and processing of cannabis and cannabis products, the legislature further declares that:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannabis production and processing is a highly regulated industry and that this chapter and the rules adopted under it are only one aspect of the regulated industry. Other applicable laws include:</p>
