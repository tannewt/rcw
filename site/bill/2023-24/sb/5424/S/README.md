[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5424-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Every general authority and limited authority Washington law enforcement agency may adopt a flexible work policy. The policy may allow for general authority and limited authority Washington peace officers to work at less than full time when feasible, such as supplementing work during peak hours with part-time officers. The flexible work policy may include alternative shift and work schedules that fit the needs of the law enforcement agency.

2. The flexible work policy adopted in subsection (1) of this section may require an officer have a certain number of years of experience as a full-time officer or have additional training for the officer to work part time or be eligible for any other types of flexible work.

3. The flexible work policy adopted in subsection (1) of this section may not cause the layoff or otherwise displace any full-time officer.

4. This section does not alter any existing collective bargaining unit, the provisions of any existing collective bargaining agreement, or the duty of a law enforcement agency to meet their duty to bargain under chapter 41.56 or 41.80 RCW. Full-time and part-time officers working for the same law enforcement agency who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement must be in the same bargaining unit.

5. This section does not alter any laws or workplace policies relating to restrictions on secondary employment for general authority and limited authority Washington peace officers.
