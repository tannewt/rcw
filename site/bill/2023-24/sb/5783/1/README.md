## Section 102
1. [Empty]

    a. The department shall commence the program by January 1, 2023, by determining an emissions baseline establishing the proportionate share that the total greenhouse gas emissions of covered entities for the first compliance period bears to the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the state during 2015 through 2019, based on data reported to the department under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter, as well as other relevant data. By October 1, 2022, the department shall adopt annual allowance budgets for the first compliance period of the program, calendar years 2023 through 2026, to be distributed from January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2026.

    b. By October 1, 2026, the department shall add to its emissions baseline by incorporating the proportionate share that the total greenhouse gas emissions of new covered entities in the second compliance period bear to the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the state during 2015 through 2019. In determining the addition to the baseline, the department may exclude a year from the determination if the department identifies that year to have been an outlier due to a state of emergency. The department shall adopt annual allowance budgets for the second compliance period of the program, calendar years 2027 through 2030, that will be distributed from January 1, 2027, through December 31, 2030.

    c. By October 1, 2028, the department shall adopt by rule the annual allowance budgets for calendar years 2031 through 2040.

    d. [Empty]

        i. By July 1, 2024, the department must amend its rules, including WAC 173-446-200 and 173-446-210, to align with the table and requirements in (d)(ii) of this subsection specifying annual allowance budgets for calendar years 2023 through 2049.

        ii.(A) Table 001 displays the total program annual allowance budgets for calendar years 2023 through 2026 required by this subsection (1)(d)(ii).

Table 001: Total program allowance budget for calendar year 2023 through 2026 established in this subsection (1)(d)(ii).

(B) The total program annual allowance budgets for each calendar year from 2027 through 2040 must decrease annually relative to the previous year by an additional 3.6 percent.

(C) The total program annual allowance budgets for each calendar year from 2041 through 2049 must decrease annually relative to the previous year by an additional 3.1 percent.

2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1)(d) of this section, the annual allowance budgets must be set to achieve the share of reductions by covered entities necessary to achieve the 2030, 2040, and 2050 statewide emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020, based on data reported to the department under chapter 70A.15 RCW or provided as required by this chapter. Annual allowance budgets must be set such that the use of offsets as compliance instruments, consistent with RCW 70A.65.170, does not prevent the achievement of the emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020. In so setting annual allowance budgets, the department must reduce the annual allowance budget relative to the limits in an amount equivalent to offset use, or in accordance with a similar methodology adopted by the department. The department must adopt annual allowance budgets for the program on a calendar year basis that provide for progressively equivalent reductions year over year. An allowance distributed under the program, either directly by the department under RCW 70A.65.110 through 70A.65.130 or through auctions under RCW 70A.65.100, does not expire and may be held or banked consistent with RCW 70A.65.100(6) and 70A.65.150(1).

3. The department must complete evaluations by December 31, 2027, and by December 31, 2035, of the performance of the program, including its performance in reducing greenhouse gases. If the evaluation shows that adjustments to the annual allowance budgets are necessary for covered entities to achieve their proportionate share of the 2030 and 2040 emission reduction limits identified in RCW 70A.45.020, as applicable, the department shall adjust the annual allowance budgets accordingly. The department must complete additional evaluations of the performance of the program by December 31, 2040, and by December 31, 2045, and make any necessary adjustments in the annual allowance budgets to ensure that covered entities achieve their proportionate share of the 2050 emission reduction limit identified in RCW 70A.45.020. Nothing in this subsection precludes the department from making additional adjustments to annual allowance budgets as necessary to ensure successful achievement of the proportionate emission reduction limits by covered entities. The department shall determine and make public the circumstances, metrics, and processes that would initiate the public consideration of additional allowance budget adjustments to ensure successful achievement of the proportionate emission reduction limits.

4. Data reported to the department under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter for 2015 through 2019 is deemed sufficient for the purpose of adopting annual allowance budgets and serving as the baseline by which covered entities demonstrate compliance under the first compliance period of the program. Data reported to the department under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter for 2023 through 2025 is deemed sufficient for adopting annual allowance budgets and serving as the baseline by which covered entities demonstrate compliance under the second compliance period of the program.

5. The legislature intends to promote a growing and sustainable economy and to avoid leakage of emissions from manufacturing to other jurisdictions. Therefore, the legislature finds that implementation of this section is contingent upon the enactment of RCW 70A.65.110.

## Section 103
1. To help minimize allowance price volatility in the auction, the department shall adopt by rule an auction floor price and a schedule for the floor price to increase by a predetermined amount every year. The department may not sell allowances at bids lower than the auction floor price. The department's rules must specify holding limits that determine the maximum number of allowances that may be held for use or trade by a registered entity at any one time. The department shall also establish a reserve auction floor price to limit extraordinary prices and to determine when to offer allowances through the allowance price containment reserve auctions authorized under this section.

2. For calendar years 2023 through 2026, the department must place no less than two percent of the total number of allowances available from the allowance budgets for those years in an allowance price containment reserve. The reserve must be designed as a mechanism to assist in containing compliance costs for covered and opt-in entities in the event of unanticipated high costs for compliance instruments.

3. [Empty]

    a. The department shall adopt rules for holding auctions of allowances from the price containment reserve when the settlement prices in the preceding auction exceed the adopted reserve auction floor price. The auction must be separate from auctions of other allowances.

    b. Allowances must also be distributed from the allowance price containment reserve by auction when new covered and opt-in entities enter the program and allowances in the emissions containment reserve under RCW 70A.65.140(5) are exhausted.

4. Only covered and opt-in entities may participate in the auction of allowances from the allowance price containment reserve.

5. The process for reserve auctions is the same as the process provided in RCW 70A.65.100 and the proceeds from reserve auctions must be treated the same.

6. The department shall by rule:

    a. Set the reserve auction floor price in advance of the reserve auction. The department may choose to establish multiple price tiers for the allowances from the reserve;

    b. Establish the requirements and schedule for the allowance price containment reserve auctions; and

    c. Establish the amount of allowances to be placed in the allowance price containment reserve after the first compliance period ending in 2026 in conformance with subsection (7) of this section.

7. [Empty]

    a. In addition to amounts the department placed into the allowance price containment reserve account pursuant to WAC 173-446-370, as it existed on January 1, 2023, the department must place an additional five percent of the annual allowance budgets for calendar years 2031 through 2042 into the allowance price containment reserve account by July 1, 2024.

    b. All of the additional allowances placed in the allowance price containment reserve account pursuant to (a) of this subsection must be made available in separate auctions held during calendar year 2024 and must be in addition to any normally scheduled allowance price containment reserve auctions. Any remaining unsold allowances may be made available in separate allowance price containment reserve auctions in subsequent years.

    c. By March 1, 2024, the department must adopt rules implementing the requirements of this subsection.

## Section 201
1. By April 1, 2024, the joint transportation committee must convene a work group to examine consumer motor vehicle fuel pricing in Washington state.

## Section 301
1. [Empty]

    a. By January 1, 2025, the department must establish a remittance program for entities consuming fuels, on or after January 1, 2023, whose emissions are exempted from coverage in the program under RCW 70A.65.080(7)(e). The remittance program must include a climate commitment act remittance portal that allows farm fuel users and freight haulers of agricultural products to electronically submit, on a quarterly basis, an application for remittance and supporting documentation.

    b. Supporting documentation for farm fuel users must include receipts showing fuel purchases for fuel used exclusively for agricultural purposes and the farm fuel user's department of revenue farmer's certificate for wholesale purchases and sales tax exemptions.

    c. Supporting documentation for entities transporting agricultural products on public highways must include fuel tax reports submitted to the department of licensing and documentation indicating the approximate time, date, and location of each agricultural product haul and a general description of the agricultural products transported.

    a. An approved application for remittance under subsection (1) of this section is eligible for a remittance equal to the auction settlement price in effect for the calendar quarter in which the fuel was purchased multiplied by eight-tenths of one percent and the number of gallons in the remittance application.

    b. An entity consuming fuels whose emissions are exempted from coverage in the program under RCW 70A.65.080(7)(e) with an approved remittance application may, at their discretion, have their remittance amount held as credits based on the auction settlement price in effect for that calendar quarter in which the fuel was purchased. These credits may be held for future trading rather than returned based on cash value. The department must establish a mechanism for tracking and administering these tradable credits for each entity exempted from coverage in the program under RCW 70A.65.080(7)(e) with an approved remittance application. The department is not responsible for any gain or loss in value associated with the change in subsequent auction prices. The department must adjust the volume of allowances available at subsequent auctions to account for these held remittance credits.

3. The remittance program authorized under this section applies both prospectively as well as retroactively to entities consuming fuels, on or after January 1, 2023, whose emissions are exempted from coverage in the program under RCW 70A.65.080(7)(e).

        i. Where the person supplies natural gas in amounts that would result in exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions if fully combusted or oxidized, excluding the amounts for fuel products that are produced or imported with a documented final point of delivery outside of Washington and combusted outside of Washington, and excluding the amounts: (A) Supplied to covered entities under (a) through (d) of this subsection; and (B) delivered to opt-in entities;

        ii. Where the person who is not a natural gas company and has a tariff with a natural gas company to deliver to an end-use customer in the state in amounts that would result in exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions if fully combusted or oxidized, excluding the amounts: (A) Supplied to covered entities under (a) through (d) of this subsection; and (B) the amounts delivered to opt-in entities;

        iii. Where the person is an end-use customer in the state who directly purchases natural gas from a person that is not a natural gas company and has the natural gas delivered through an interstate pipeline to a distribution system owned by the purchaser in amounts that would result in exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions if fully combusted or oxidized, excluding the amounts: (A) Supplied to covered entities under (a) through (d) of this subsection; and (B) delivered to opt-in entities.

2. A person is a covered entity as of the beginning of the second compliance period and all subsequent compliance periods if the person reported emissions under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided emissions data as required by this chapter for any calendar year from 2023 through 2025, where the person owns or operates a waste to energy facility utilized by a county and city solid waste management program and the facility's emissions equal or exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

3. A person is a covered entity beginning January 1, 2031, and all subsequent compliance periods if the person reported emissions under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided emissions data as required by this chapter for any calendar year from 2027 through 2029, where the person owns or operates a railroad company, as that term is defined in RCW 81.04.010, and the railroad company's emissions equal or exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

4. When a covered entity reports, during a compliance period, emissions from a facility under RCW 70A.15.2200 that are below the thresholds specified in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the covered entity continues to have a compliance obligation through the current compliance period. When a covered entity reports emissions below the threshold for each year during an entire compliance period, or has ceased all processes at the facility requiring reporting under RCW 70A.15.2200, the entity is no longer a covered entity as of the beginning of the subsequent compliance period unless the department provides notice at least 12 months before the end of the compliance period that the facility's emissions were within 10 percent of the threshold and that the person will continue to be designated as a covered entity in order to ensure equity among all covered entities. Whenever a covered entity ceases to be a covered entity, the department shall notify the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature of the name of the entity and the reason the entity is no longer a covered entity.

5. For types of emission sources described in subsection (1) of this section that begin or modify operation after January 1, 2023, and types of emission sources described in subsection (2) of this section that begin or modify operation after 2027, coverage under the program starts in the calendar year in which emissions from the source exceed the applicable thresholds in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, or upon formal notice from the department that the source is expected to exceed the applicable emissions threshold, whichever happens first. Sources meeting these conditions are required to transfer their first allowances on the first transfer deadline of the year following the year in which their emissions were equal to or exceeded the emissions threshold.

6. For emission sources described in subsection (1) of this section that are in operation or otherwise active between 2015 and 2019 but were not required to report emissions for those years under RCW 70A.15.2200 for the reporting periods between 2015 and 2019, coverage under the program starts in the calendar year following the year in which emissions from the source exceed the applicable thresholds in subsection (1) of this section as reported pursuant to RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter, or upon formal notice from the department that the source is expected to exceed the applicable emissions threshold for the first year that source is required to report emissions, whichever happens first. Sources meeting these criteria are required to transfer their first allowances on the first transfer deadline of the year following the year in which their emissions, as reported under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter, were equal to or exceeded the emissions threshold.

7. The following emissions are exempt from coverage in the program, regardless of the emissions reported under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter:

    a. Emissions from the combustion of aviation fuels;

    b. Emissions from watercraft fuels supplied in Washington that are combusted outside of Washington;

    c. Emissions from a coal-fired electric generation facility exempted from additional greenhouse gas limitations, requirements, or performance standards under RCW 80.80.110;

    d. Carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of biomass or biofuels;

    e. [Empty]

        i. Motor vehicle fuel or special fuel that is used exclusively for agricultural purposes by a farm fuel user.  For the purposes of this subsection, "agricultural purposes" and "farm fuel user" have the same meanings as provided in RCW 82.08.865.

        ii. The department must determine a method for expanding the exemption provided under (e)(i) of this subsection to include fuels used for the purpose of transporting agricultural products, as defined in RCW 82.04.213, on public highways. The department must maintain this expanded exemption for a period of five years, in order to provide the agricultural sector with a feasible transition period.

        iii. The exemptions under this subsection (7)(e) must be provided through at least two methods in a form and manner required by the department:

(A) A remittance program established in section 301 of this act, including a tradable credit mechanism as provided under section 301(2)(b) of this act; or

(B) An exemption certificate method if a buyer of motor vehicle fuel or special fuel provides the seller with an exemption certificate in a form and manner prescribed by the department.

        iv. In addition to the methods described in (e)(iii) of this subsection, the department may prescribe by rule additional methods for implementing the exemptions under this subsection (7)(e);

    f. Emissions from facilities with North American industry classification system code 92811 (national security); and

    g. Emissions from municipal solid waste landfills that are subject to, and in compliance with, chapter 70A.540 RCW.

8. The department shall not require multiple covered entities to have a compliance obligation for the same emissions. The department may by rule authorize refineries, fuel suppliers, facilities using natural gas, and natural gas utilities to provide by agreement for the assumption of the compliance obligation for fuel or natural gas supplied and combusted in the state. The department must be notified of such an agreement at least 12 months prior to the compliance obligation period for which the agreement is applicable.

9. [Empty]

    a. The legislature intends to promote a growing and sustainable economy and to avoid leakage of emissions from manufacturing to other locations. The legislature further intends to see innovative new businesses locate and grow in Washington that contribute to Washington's prosperity and environmental objectives.

    b. Consistent with the intent of the legislature to avoid the leakage of emissions to other jurisdictions, in achieving the state's greenhouse gas limits in RCW 70A.45.020, the state, including lead agencies under chapter 43.21C RCW, shall pursue the limits in a manner that recognizes that the siting and placement of new or expanded best-in-class facilities with lower carbon emitting processes is in the economic and environmental interests of the state of Washington.

    c. In conducting a life-cycle analysis, if required, for new or expanded facilities that require review under chapter 43.21C RCW, a lead agency must evaluate and attribute any potential net cumulative greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the project as compared to other existing facilities or best available technology including best-in-class facilities and emerging lower carbon processes that supply the same product or end use. The department may adopt rules to determine the appropriate threshold for applying this analysis.

    d. Covered emissions from an entity that is or will be a covered entity under this chapter may not be the basis for denial of a permit for a new or expanded facility. Covered emissions must be included in the analysis undertaken pursuant to (c) of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection requires a lead agency or a permitting agency to approve or issue a permit to a permit applicant, including to a new or expanded fossil fuel project.

    e. A lead agency under chapter 43.21C RCW or a permitting agency shall allow a new or expanded facility that is a covered entity or opt-in entity to satisfy a mitigation requirement for its covered emissions under chapter 316, Laws of 2021 and under any greenhouse gas emission mitigation requirements for covered emissions under chapter 43.21C RCW by submitting to the department the number of compliance instruments equivalent to its covered emissions during a compliance period.

## Section 303
1. The department of ecology must convene a work group to review rules and processes that are developed to exempt the emissions in RCW 70A.65.080 from coverage under chapter 70A.65 RCW and to develop recommendations for changes to laws, rules, policies, and practices to ensure the full use and benefit of the exemptions.

2. The work group must be comprised of the following members:

    a. A representative from the department of revenue;

    b. A representative from the department of licensing;

    d. Representatives from statewide organizations advocating for the aviation industry and aviation enthusiasts;

    e. Representatives from statewide organizations advocating for the watercraft industry and watercraft users;

    f. Representatives from statewide organizations advocating for the agricultural industry and farmers;

    g. Representatives from statewide organizations advocating for the fuel refineries, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers; and

    h. Representatives from statewide organizations that advocate for the other products and activities that fall within the exemption provided in RCW 70A.65.080.

3. The work group shall review and make recommendations on the following topics:

    a. Whether exemption processes have been responsive to how markets have reacted to the greenhouse gas emissions cap and invest program;

    b. Whether exemption processes can be improved or alternatives developed to reduce the burdens on those seeking an exemption;

    c. The adequacy of current guidance and tools to report exemptions;

    d. Whether changes are necessary related to the remittance program created in section 301 of this act; and

    e. Other issues and topics the work group determines are necessary to review the full use and enjoyment of the exemptions provided in RCW 70A.65.080.

4. Any statewide organizations advocating for an industry or activity described in RCW 70A.65.080 may submit in writing its recommendations to the work group for its review and consideration.

5. Committee members are not entitled to be reimbursed for travel expenses if they are elected officials or are participating on behalf of an employer, governmental entity, or other organization. Any reimbursement for members is subject to chapter 43.03 RCW.

6. The department of ecology must submit a report containing its review and recommendations to the appropriate committees of the legislature by September 1, 2024.

## Section 304
The climate commitment act remittance account is created in the state treasury. The account may receive deposits from auction proceeds pursuant to RCW 70A.65.100. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may only be used for the purpose of the remittance program established in section 301 of this act for entities consuming fuels whose emissions are exempted from coverage in the program under RCW 70A.65.080(7)(e). The department may not expend more than 10 percent per year on administrative costs associated with the remittance program.

## Section 401
1. By March 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, the office of financial management and the department of ecology must jointly calculate the amount of revenue collected from auctions under this chapter for the immediately preceding fiscal year in excess of the revenue estimate prepared in October 2022, reduced by any amount appropriated in the omnibus operating appropriations act from the climate commitment act remittance account created in section 304 of this act for the fiscal year. This information must be transmitted to the department of licensing and to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature.

2. Using the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section, for fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2026, the department must reduce vehicle license fees and the license fees based on declared gross weight under RCW 46.17.350 and 46.17.355. The fee reduction per vehicle is the lesser of: The amount determined under subsection (1) of this section divided by the anticipated number of vehicles eligible for the fee reduction; or the license fee for the vehicle.

    a. The department shall hold a maximum of four auctions annually, plus any necessary reserve auctions. An auction may include allowances from the annual allowance budget of the current year and allowances from the annual allowance budgets from prior years that remain to be distributed. The department must transmit to the environmental justice council an auction notice at least 60 days prior to each auction, as well as a summary results report and a postauction public proceeds report within 60 days after each auction. The department must communicate the results of the previous calendar year's auctions to the environmental justice council on an annual basis beginning in 2024.

    b. The department must make future vintage allowances available through parallel auctions at least twice annually in addition to the auctions through which current vintage allowances are exclusively offered under (a) of this subsection.

The application must include the documentation required for review and approval by the department. A registered entity is eligible to participate only after receiving a notice of approval by the department.

    b. Each registered entity that elects to participate in the auction must have a different representative. Only a representative with an approved auction account is authorized to access the auction platform to submit an application or confirm the intent to bid for the registered entity, submit bids on behalf of the registered entity during the bidding window, or to download reports specific to the auction.

5. The department may require a bid guarantee, payable to the financial services administrator, in an amount greater than or equal to the sum of the maximum value of the bids to be submitted by the registered entity.

    a. A covered entity or an opt-in entity may not buy more than 10 percent of the allowances offered during a single auction;

    b. A general market participant may not buy more than four percent of the allowances offered during a single auction and may not in aggregate own more than 10 percent of total allowances to be issued in a calendar year;

8. The department shall adopt by rule provisions to guard against bidder collusion and minimize the potential for market manipulation. A registered entity may not release or disclose any bidding information including: Intent to participate or refrain from participation; auction approval status; intent to bid; bidding strategy; bid price or bid quantity; or information on the bid guarantee provided to the financial services administrator. The department may cancel or restrict a previously approved auction participation application or reject a new application if the department determines that a registered entity has:

    a. Provided false or misleading facts;

    b. Withheld material information that could influence a decision by the department;

    c. Violated any part of the auction rules;

    d. Violated registration requirements; or

    e. Violated any of the rules regarding the conduct of the auction.

    c. Financial, proprietary, and other market sensitive information as determined by the department that is submitted to the department pursuant to this chapter;

    d. Financial, proprietary, and other market sensitive information as determined by the department that is submitted to the independent contractor or the financial services administrator engaged by the department pursuant to subsection (3) of this section; and

    e.

10. Any cancellation or restriction approved by the department under subsection (8) of this section may be permanent or for a specified number of auctions and the cancellation or restriction imposed is not exclusive and is in addition to the remedies that may be available pursuant to chapter 19.86 RCW or other state or federal laws, if applicable.

11. The department shall design allowance auctions so as to allow, to the maximum extent practicable, linking with external greenhouse gas emissions trading programs in other jurisdictions and to facilitate the transfer of allowances when the state's program has entered into a linkage agreement with other external greenhouse gas emissions trading programs. The department may conduct auctions jointly with linked jurisdictions.

12. In setting the number of allowances offered at each auction, the department shall consider the allowances in the marketplace due to the marketing of allowances issued as required under RCW 70A.65.110, 70A.65.120, and 70A.65.130 in the department's determination of the number of allowances to be offered at auction. The department shall offer only such number of allowances at each auction as will enhance the likelihood of achieving the goals of RCW 70A.45.020.
