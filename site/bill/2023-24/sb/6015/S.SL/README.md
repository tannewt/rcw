[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6015-S.SL.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Cities and counties planning under this chapter shall enforce land use regulations for residential development as provided in this section:

    a. Garages and carports may not be required as a way to meet minimum parking requirements for residential development;

    b. Parking spaces that count towards minimum parking requirements may be enclosed or unenclosed;

    c. Parking spaces in tandem must count towards meeting minimum parking requirements at a rate of one space for every 20 linear feet with any necessary provisions for turning radius. For purposes of this subsection, "tandem" is defined as having two or more vehicles, one in front of or behind the others with a single means of ingress and egress;

    d. Existence of legally nonconforming gravel surfacing in existing designated parking areas may not be a reason for prohibiting utilization of existing space in the parking area to meet local parking standards, up to a maximum of six parking spaces;

    e. Parking spaces may not be required to exceed eight feet by 20 feet, except for required parking for people with disabilities;

    f. Any county planning under this chapter, and any cities within those counties with a population greater than 6,000, may not require off-street parking as a condition of permitting a residential project if compliance with tree retention would otherwise make a proposed residential development or redevelopment infeasible; and

    g. Parking spaces that consist of grass block pavers may count toward minimum parking requirements.

2. Existing parking spaces that do not conform to the requirements of this section by the effective date of this act are not required to be modified or resized, except for compliance with the Americans with disabilities act. Existing paved parking lots are not required to change the size of existing parking spaces during resurfacing if doing so will be more costly or require significant reconfiguration of the parking space locations.

3. The provisions in subsection (1) of this section do not apply to portions of cities within a one-mile radius of a commercial airport in Washington with at least 9,000,000 annual enplanements.
