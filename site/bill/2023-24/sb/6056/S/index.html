<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that human trafficking is a serious problem in the United States and in the state of Washington. Polaris project, the largest anti-human trafficking organization in the United States, hosts the national human trafficking hotline. Since the hotline's inception in 2007, over fifty thousand human trafficking cases have been discovered. In 2018, the hotline identified over 23,000 survivors of human trafficking nationally. Human trafficking is an international problem that will continue to exploit the most vulnerable individuals in a community if proper training and identification support is not provided to the community at large.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also recognizes that human trafficking is prevalent within hotels and motels across the country and in Washington. In 2018, 81 percent of the active sex trafficking cases in the United States involved a victim who was compelled to provide a commercial sexual act at a hotel. In 2017, 45 percent of youth victims surveyed reported having been exploited in hotels. There is evidence to suggest that training can be an effective way of raising awareness about human trafficking. According to the Washington-based anti-trafficking group businesses ending slavery and trafficking, hoteliers who received human trafficking awareness training reported a significant increase in the likelihood that they would call law enforcement if they suspected trafficking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to work toward the goal of ridding hotels and other places of accommodation in Washington of human trafficking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
