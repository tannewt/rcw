# SB 6056 - Human trafficking/hotels

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6056-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that human trafficking is a serious problem in the United States and in the state of Washington. Polaris project, the largest anti-human trafficking organization in the United States, hosts the national human trafficking hotline. Since the hotline's inception in 2007, over fifty thousand human trafficking cases have been discovered. In 2018, the hotline identified over 23,000 survivors of human trafficking nationally. Human trafficking is an international problem that will continue to exploit the most vulnerable individuals in a community if proper training and identification support is not provided to the community at large.

2. The legislature also recognizes that human trafficking is prevalent within hotels and motels across the country and in Washington. In 2018, 81 percent of the active sex trafficking cases in the United States involved a victim who was compelled to provide a commercial sexual act at a hotel. In 2017, 45 percent of youth victims surveyed reported having been exploited in hotels. There is evidence to suggest that training can be an effective way of raising awareness about human trafficking. According to the Washington-based anti-trafficking group businesses ending slavery and trafficking, hoteliers who received human trafficking awareness training reported a significant increase in the likelihood that they would call law enforcement if they suspected trafficking.

3. It is the intent of the legislature to work toward the goal of ridding hotels and other places of accommodation in Washington of human trafficking.

## Section 2
1. A transient accommodation shall provide annual training regarding human trafficking to each of its employees.

2. Training must be provided to all employees no later than February 1, 2025, and to new employees no later than 90 days after they begin their employment.

3. The training required under this section must include, at a minimum, the following:

    a. The definition of human trafficking and commercial exploitation of children, and the difference between sex trafficking and labor trafficking;

    b. Guidance specific to the public lodging sector concerning how to identify individuals who may be victims of human trafficking based on behaviors and traits of trafficking regardless of race, creed, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, or class;

    c. Guidance concerning the role of the employees in appropriately responding to suspected human trafficking; and

    d. The contact information of appropriate agencies, which must include at least one national human trafficking hotline telephone number and one telephone number of an appropriate local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over human trafficking.

4. By January 1, 2025, every operator of a transient accommodation shall post in a location conspicuous to employees signage regarding human trafficking awareness, printed in an easily legible font in English and any other primary language spoken by at least 10 percent of the employees.

5. By January 1, 2025, every operator of a transient accommodation shall implement procedures for the voluntary reporting of suspected human trafficking to the national human trafficking hotline or to a local law enforcement agency, and a policy to act as a guide for all employees on human trafficking prevention.

6. Contents of the training and copies of the signage must be made available for inspection, upon request by the department.
