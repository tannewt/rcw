<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a full set of project procurement, contracting, and funding tools are needed to enable the delivery of transportation projects in a manner most advantageous to the public. Current public-private partnership laws have failed to spur innovative proposals from the private sector or new project delivery approaches from the department. The legislature confirms the findings from previous studies that current laws and administrative processes are the primary obstacle impairing the state's ability to utilize public-private partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that a new public-private partnership law is needed to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Transparently demonstrate and deliver better value for the public including, but not limited to, expedited project delivery and more effective management of project life-cycle costs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an additional option for delivering complex transportation projects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate private sector expertise and innovation into transportation project delivery;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allocate project risks to the parties best able to manage those risks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow new sources for private capital;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase access to federal funding and financing mechanisms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better align private sector incentives with public priorities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide consistency in the review and approval processes for the full range of project delivery tools and contracting methods.</p>
</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The proceeds of grant anticipation revenue bonds authorized under 23 U.S.C. Sec. 122 and applicable state law. Legislative authorization and appropriation are required to use this source of financing;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>As security for the payment of any financing, the revenues from the project may be pledged, but no such pledge of revenues constitutes in any manner or to any extent a general obligation of the state, unless specifically authorized by the legislature. Any financing described in this section may be structured on a senior, parity, or subordinate basis to any other financing.</p>

Factors that may be considered in evaluating proposals include but are not limited to: Price; maintainability; reliability; commonality; performance levels; life-cycle cost if applicable under this section; cost of transportation or delivery; delivery schedule offered; installation cost; cost of spare parts; availability of parts and service offered; and the following:</p>

<p>When purchases are made through a request for proposal process, proposals received shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. When issuing a request for proposal for the procurement of propulsion equipment or systems that include an engine, the request for proposal must specify the use of a life-cycle cost analysis that includes an evaluation of fuel efficiency. When a life-cycle cost analysis is used, the life-cycle cost of a proposal shall be given at least the same relative importance as the initial price element specified in the request of proposal documents. The department may reject any and all proposals received. If the proposals are not rejected, the award shall be made to the proposer whose proposal is most advantageous to the department, considering price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal.</p>
