## Section 1
1. The legislature intends to ensure that the medicaid program is operating under sound fiscal stewardship. This requires dedicated program integrity efforts focused on paying the right dollar amount to the right provider for the right reason. Strengthening program integrity efforts helps to ensure that every medicaid dollar stretches as far as possible for those insured through medicaid.

2. The legislature finds that the health care authority is responsible for overseeing all of Washington's medicaid programs, including those administered by other state agencies. Effective oversight by the health care authority will advance the legislature's objective of ensuring that the right services are delivered to the right person at the right time with measurable outcomes.

The provisions of this title shall be so administered as to conform with federal requirements with respect to eligibility for the receipt of federal grants or funds.
