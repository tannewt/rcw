<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Washington is now experiencing the effects of a climate crisis: Hotter summers with record-breaking temperatures, devastating fires, drought conditions, and rising sea levels that erode our coastlines and are causing some communities to move upland;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and landfills are documented by the United States environmental protection agency to be the 3rd largest human-made source, with food, yard waste, and other plant-based organic material degrading in landfills to methane;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food waste is a major issue in the United States and globally, that, according to the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations, unwanted and discarded food squanders resources, including water, land, energy, labor, and capital, estimated that one-third of the food produced in the world for human consumption, about 1,300,000,000 tons, is lost or wasted every year, and the food loss and waste in industrialized countries equates to a value of approximately $680,000,000,000;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Harvard University food law and policy clinic has estimated that 40 percent of the food supply in the United States is not eaten and that according to the United States environmental protection agency and the United States department of agriculture, food loss and waste is the single largest component of disposed municipal solid waste in the United States;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2015, that the administrator of the United States environmental protection agency and the secretary of the United States department of agriculture announced a national goal of reducing food waste by 50 percent by the year 2030. In 2019, Washington established the same goal in RCW 70A.205.715;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compost and other products of organic material management facilities have beneficial applications and can improve soil health, water quality, and other environmental outcomes. However, in order for the products of organic material management facilities to lead to improved environmental outcomes and for the economics of the operations of these facilities to pencil out, it is important that inbound sources of organic material waste are free of plastic contamination, pesticides, and other materials that will reduce compost quality; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Farmers, processors, retailers, and food banks in Washington are leaders in addressing this issue, and in 2022, with the enactment of chapter 180, Laws of 2022 (Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1799), Washington took significant steps towards the improvement of organic material management systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's intent to provide additional tools and financial resources to build on this progress in coming years by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Creating a variety of grant programs to support food waste reduction, food rescue, and other organic material management system improvements, including grants to support the implementation of new policy requirements related to organic material management;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amending solid waste management requirements in support of improved organic material management outcomes, including through the statewide standardization of colors and labels for organic, recycling, and garbage bins, and amending the organic material management service requirements in local jurisdictions and that apply to businesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardizing and establishing a clear system of food expiration date labeling requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibiting plastic product stickers and making changes to product degradability labeling requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amending the state building code in support of organic material management; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing to discuss how to maximize donations of food from generators of unwanted edible food.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's intent for the following management option preferences to apply to the management of food under this act, including the provisions of law being amended by this act, in order of most preferred to least preferred:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Prevents wasted food;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donates or upcycles food;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feeds animals or leaves food unharvested;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Composts or anaerobically digests materials with beneficial use of the digestate or biosolids;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anaerobically digests materials with the disposal of digestate or biosolids, or applies material to the land; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sends materials down the drain, to landfills, or incinerates material, with or without accompanying energy recovery.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department must attempt to achieve fair distribution of reimbursement funding across different farm size categories, based on acreage categories determined by the department, and which is not to exceed a maximum of $20,000 per fiscal year for the largest farming operation category determined by the department;</p>
