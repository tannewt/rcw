<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that artificial intelligence is a fast-evolving technology that holds extraordinary potential and has a myriad of uses for both the public and private sectors. Advances in artificial intelligence technology have led to programs that are capable of creating text, audio, and media that are difficult to distinguish from media created by a human. This technology has the potential to provide great benefits to people if used well and to cause great harm if used irresponsibly.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that generative artificial intelligence has become widely available to consumers and has great potential to become a versatile tool for a wide audience. It can streamline tasks, save time and money for users, and facilitate further innovation. Artificial intelligence has the potential to help solve urgent challenges, while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure when used responsibly.</p>
<p>However, when used irresponsibly, artificial intelligence has the potential to further perpetuate bias and harm to historically excluded groups, as demonstrated by previous innovations like facial recognition technology. It is vital that the fundamental rights to privacy and freedom from discrimination are properly safeguarded as society explores this emerging technology.</p>
<p>The federal government has not yet enacted meaningful regulations or oversight into generative artificial intelligence and to date the industry has self-regulated. In July 2023, the federal government announced voluntary commitments by seven leading artificial intelligence companies, including three companies headquartered in Washington, to move toward safe, secure, and transparent development of artificial intelligence technology. The October 2023 executive order on the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence builds on this work by directing developers of artificial intelligence systems to share their safety test results with the United States government.</p>
<p>Numerous businesses and agencies have developed principles for artificial intelligence. In Washington, Washington technology solutions (WaTech) developed guiding principles for artificial intelligence use by state agencies. These principles share common themes: Accountability, transparency, human control, privacy and security, advancing equity, and promoting innovation.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that the possible impacts of advancements of generative artificial intelligences on Washingtonians require careful consideration in order to promote transparency, accountability, equity, and innovation, and to mitigate risks and potential harms.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Each subcommittee must contain at least one member from an advocacy organization that represents communities that are disproportionately vulnerable to being harmed by algorithmic bias including, but not limited to: African American; Hispanic American; Native American; Asian American; Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities; religious minorities; individuals with disabilities; and other vulnerable communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the attorney general must administer and provide staff support for the task force. The office of the attorney general may, when deemed necessary by the task force, retain consultants to provide data analysis, research, recommendations, training, and other services to the task force for the purposes provided in subsection (4) of this section. The office of the attorney general may work with the task force to determine appropriate subcommittees as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The executive committee of the task force shall examine the development and use of artificial intelligence by private and public sector entities and make recommendations to the legislature regarding standards for the use and regulation of artificial intelligence systems to protect Washingtonians' safety, privacy, and civil and intellectual property rights. The task force findings and recommendations must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A literature review of public policy issues with artificial intelligence, including benefits and risks to the public broadly, historically excluded communities, and other identifiable groups, racial equity considerations, workforce impacts, and ethical concerns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A review of existing protections under state and federal law for individual data and privacy rights, safety, civil rights, and intellectual property rights, and how federal, state, and local laws relating to artificial intelligence align, differ, conflict, and interact across levels of government;</p>
