<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that artificial intelligence is a fast-evolving technology that holds extraordinary potential and has a myriad of uses for both the public and private sectors. Advances in artificial intelligence technology have led to programs that are capable of creating text, audio, and media that are difficult to distinguish from media created by a human. This technology has the potential to provide great benefits to people if used well and to cause great harm if used irresponsibly.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that generative artificial intelligence has become widely available to consumers and has great potential to become a versatile tool for a wide audience. It can streamline tasks, save time and money for users, and facilitate further innovation. Artificial intelligence has the potential to help solve urgent challenges, while making our world more prosperous, productive, innovative, and secure when used responsibly.</p>
<p>Washington state is in a unique position to become a center for artificial intelligence and machine learning. When used irresponsibly, artificial intelligence has the potential to further perpetuate bias and harm to historically excluded groups. It is vital that the fundamental rights to privacy and freedom from discrimination are properly safeguarded as society explores this emerging technology.</p>
<p>The federal government has not yet enacted binding regulations, however in July 2023, the federal government announced voluntary commitments by seven leading artificial intelligence companies, including three companies headquartered in Washington, to move toward safe, secure, and transparent development of artificial intelligence technology. The October 2023 executive order on the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence builds on this work by directing developers of artificial intelligence systems to share their safety test results for certain highly capable models with the United States government.</p>
<p>Numerous businesses and agencies have developed principles for artificial intelligence. In Washington, Washington technology solutions (WaTech) developed guiding principles for artificial intelligence use by state agencies. These principles share common themes: Accountability, transparency, human control, privacy and security, advancing equity, and promoting innovation and economic development.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that the possible impacts of advancements in generative artificial intelligence for Washingtonians requires careful consideration in order to mitigate risks and potential harms, while promoting transparency, accountability, equity, and innovation that drives technological breakthroughs. On January 30, 2024, governor Inslee issued Executive Order 24-01 directing WaTech to identify generative artificial intelligence initiatives that could be implemented in state operations and issue guidelines for public sector procurement and usage.</p>
