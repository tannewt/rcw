<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No licensee may engage in the business of making small loans without first obtaining a small loan endorsement to its license from the director in accordance with this chapter. An endorsement will be required for each location where a licensee engages in the business of making small loans, but a small loan endorsement may authorize a licensee to make small loans at a location different than the licensed locations where it cashes or sells checks. A licensee may have more than one endorsement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee must set the due date of a small loan on or after the date of the borrower's next pay date. If a borrower's next pay date is within seven days of taking out the loan, a licensee must set the due date of a small loan on or after the borrower's second pay date after the date the small loan is made. The termination date of a small loan may not exceed the origination date of that same small loan by more than forty-five days, including weekends and holidays, unless the term of the loan is extended by agreement of both the borrower and the licensee and no additional fee or interest is charged. The maximum principal amount of any small loan, or the outstanding principal balances of all small loans made by all licensees to a single borrower at any one time, may not exceed seven hundred dollars or thirty percent of the gross monthly income of the borrower, whichever is lower. A licensee may not knowingly loan to a single borrower at any one time, in a single small loan or in the aggregate, more than the maximum principal amount described in this section. A licensee is prohibited from making a small loan to a borrower who is in default on another small loan until after that loan is paid in full or two years have passed from the origination date of the small loan, whichever occurs first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A licensee is prohibited from making a small loan to a borrower in an installment plan with any licensee until after the plan is paid in full or two years have passed from the origination date of the installment plan, whichever occurs first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A borrower is prohibited from receiving more than eight small loans from all licensees in any twelve-month period. A licensee is prohibited from making a small loan to a borrower if making that small loan would result in a borrower receiving more than eight small loans from all licensees in any twelve-month period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other law, for small loans made or renewed after the effective date of this section, a licensee that has obtained the required small loan endorsement may not charge, contract for, or receive, directly or indirectly, charges or amounts exceeding an annual percentage rate of 36 percent on the unpaid balance of the amount financed. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;annual percentage rate&quot; includes all amounts, charges, and payments made directly or indirectly, incident to, ancillary to, or as a condition of a small loan, whether voluntary, optional, or required, including any amount paid to a broker or credit services organization. The annual percentage rate includes, but is not limited to, all interest, fees, charges, and other payments as set forth in the regulations to implement the military lending act, 10 U.S.C. Sec. 987, and 32 C.F.R. Sec. 232.1 et seq. (2015). The annual percentage rate must be calculated as specified in 32 C.F.R. Sec. 232.1 et seq. (2015).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In connection with making a small loan, a licensee may advance moneys on the security of a postdated check. The licensee may not accept any other property, title to property, or other evidence of ownership of property as collateral for a small loan. The licensee may accept only one postdated check per loan as security for the loan. A licensee may permit a borrower to redeem a postdated check with a payment of cash or the equivalent of cash. The licensee may disburse the proceeds of a small loan in cash, in the form of a check, or in the form of the electronic equivalent of cash or a check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may at any time cash or advance any moneys on a postdated check or draft in excess of the amount of goods or services purchased without first obtaining a small loan endorsement to a check casher or check seller license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section applies to any small loan made to a consumer physically located in the state, whether the transaction is conducted in person, by internet, facsimile, telephone, kiosk, mail, or other means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person may not solicit, broker, or engage in any other activity intended to facilitate or result in, or that in fact facilitates or results in, the origination of a small loan that violates this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is a violation of this chapter for any person subject to this chapter to:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Solicit, make, contract for, offer, assist, broker, or arrange for a borrower to obtain a small loan with a higher annual percentage rate or amount of interest, consideration, charge, or other payment received incident to the loan than is permitted by RCW 31.45.073;</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Advertise, print, display, publish, distribute, or broadcast or cause or permit to be advertised, printed, displayed, published, distributed, or broadcasted any statement or representation that is false, misleading, or deceptive, or that omits material information;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to pay the annual assessment by the date and time as specified in RCW 31.45.050;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fail to pay any other fee, assessment, or moneys due the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to any other penalties, any transaction in violation of subsection (1) of this section is uncollectible and unenforceable, and the borrower shall be entitled to restitution of any amounts paid.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a small loan exceeds the annual percentage rate permitted by RCW 31.45.073, a person is a lender subject to the requirements of this chapter notwithstanding the fact that the person purports to act as an agent, service provider, or in another capacity for another entity that is exempt from this chapter, if, among other things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The person holds, acquires, or maintains, directly or indirectly, the predominant economic interest, risk, or reward in the small loan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Markets, solicits, brokers, arranges, facilitates, or services small loans; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holds, or has the right, requirement, or first right of refusal to acquire small loans, a share of receivables, or another direct or indirect interest in small loans or a small loan program; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The totality of the circumstances indicate that the person is the lender and the transaction is structured to evade the requirements of this chapter. Circumstances that weigh in favor of a person being a lender include, without limitation, when the person:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Indemnifies, insures, or protects an exempt entity from any costs or risks related to a small loan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predominantly designs, controls, or operates a small loan program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holds the trademark or intellectual property rights in the brand, underwriting system, or other core aspects of a small loan program; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purports to act as an agent or service provider or in another capacity for an exempt entity while acting directly as a lender in other states.</p>
</li>
</ol>
