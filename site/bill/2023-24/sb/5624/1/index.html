<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the substance use recovery services advisory committee was tasked with developing measures to help individuals with substance use disorder access outreach, treatment, and recovery support services. The committee was responsible for identifying services that would be low barrier, person-centered, informed by people with lived experience, and culturally and linguistically appropriate.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds while the urgent public health needs did not begin with the state supreme court decision in 2021 and subsequent enacted legislation, there must be a system in place that helps people with substance use disorders. Any solution must address not only the criminal legal response, but also appropriate access to medical, harm reduction, and social services.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that the recommendations made by the substance use recovery services advisory committee reflect hours of diligent work by individuals with a range of professional and personal experience, who brought that expertise to the group, and whose expertise is reflected in the committee recommendations.</p>

<p>When making a decision on an application for licensing or certification of an opioid treatment program, the department shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Consult with the county legislative authorities in the area in which an applicant proposes to locate a program and the city legislative authority in any city in which an applicant proposes to locate a program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>License or certify only programs that will be sited in accordance with the appropriate county or city land use ordinances. Counties and cities may require conditional use permits with reasonable conditions for the siting of programs only to the extent that such reasonable conditional use requirements applied to opioid treatment programs are similarly applied to other essential public facilities and health care settings. Pursuant to RCW 36.70A.200, no local comprehensive plan or development regulation may preclude the siting of essential public facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not discriminate in its licensing or certification decision on the basis of the corporate structure of the applicant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the size of the population in need of treatment in the area in which the program would be located and license or certify only applicants whose programs meet the necessary treatment needs of that population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the availability of other certified opioid treatment programs near the area in which the applicant proposes to locate the program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the transportation systems that would provide service to the program and whether the systems will provide reasonable opportunities to access the program for persons in need of treatment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider whether the applicant has, or has demonstrated in the past, the capability to provide the appropriate services to assist the persons who utilize the program in meeting goals established by the legislature in RCW 71.24.585. The department shall prioritize licensing or certification to applicants who have demonstrated such capability and are able to measure their success in meeting such outcomes</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>No city or county legislative authority may impose a maximum capacity for an opioid treatment program .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A program applying for licensing or certification from the department and a program applying for a contract from a state agency that has been denied the licensing or certification or contract shall be provided with a written notice specifying the rationale and reasons for the denial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opioid treatment programs may order, possess, dispense, and administer medications approved by the United States food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder, and reversal of opioid overdose. For an opioid treatment program to order, possess, and dispense any other legend drug, including controlled substances, the opioid treatment program must obtain additional licensure as required by the department, except for patient-owned medications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opioid treatment programs may accept, possess, and administer patient-owned medications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registered nurses and licensed practical nurses may dispense up to a thirty-one day supply of medications approved by the United States food and drug administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder to patients of the opioid treatment program, under an order or prescription and in compliance with 42 C.F.R.

<li>
<p>Subject to funds appropriated for this specific purpose, a program is established in the department to fund the construction costs necessary to start up opioid treatment programs in regions of the state which currently lack access to such programs.</p>
