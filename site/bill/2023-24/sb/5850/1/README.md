## Section 3
1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must allocate funding to educational service districts, school districts, and public schools to help eliminate barriers to high school completion for students who are 16 to 21 years of age, are severely deficient in academic credits, unable to graduate high school with their peer group, and enrolled in a statewide dropout reengagement program as defined in RCW 28A.175.105. Given that these students have varied needs, the use of these funds are flexible and can be used for supports such as:

The allocation of funding for either small school districts or rural school districts, or both, must be differentiated and include a base amount of funding.

3. The office of the superintendent of public instruction may adopt rules to implement this section.

4. For the purposes of this section, "public schools" has the same meaning as in RCW 28A.150.010.
