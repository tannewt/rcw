<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The commission may impose fees, as the commission deems reasonable and appropriate, in compliance with the horseracing integrity and safety act of 2020, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 3051 et seq., as amended. The commission may adopt rules to implement this section.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every person making application for license to hold a race meet, under the provisions of this chapter shall file an application with the commission which shall set forth the time, the place, the number of days such meet will continue, and such other information as the commission may require. The commission shall be the sole judge of whether or not the race meet shall be licensed and the number of days the meet shall continue. No person who has been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude shall be issued a license, nor shall any license be issued to any person who has violated the terms or provisions of this chapter, or any of the rules and regulations of the commission made pursuant thereto, or who has failed to pay to the commission any or all sums required under the provisions of this chapter. The license shall specify the number of days the race meet shall continue and the number of races per day, which shall include not less than six nor more than 11 live races per day, and for which a fee shall be paid daily in advance of $200; in addition any newly authorized live race meets shall pay $200 per day for the first year: PROVIDED, That if unforeseen obstacles arise, which prevent the holding, or completion of any race meet, the license fee for the meet, or for a portion which cannot be held may be refunded the licensee, if the commission deems the reasons for failure to hold or complete the race meet sufficient. Any unexpired license held by any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter, or any of the rules or regulations of the commission made pursuant thereto, or who fails to pay to the commission any and all sums required under the provisions of this chapter, shall be subject to cancellation and revocation by the commission. Such cancellation shall be made only after a summary hearing before the commission, of which three days' notice, in writing, shall be given the licensee, specifying the grounds for the proposed cancellation, and at which hearing the licensee shall be given an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the proposed cancellation.</p>

<p>The Washington horse racing commission operating account is created in the custody of the state treasurer.

During the 2024 state fiscal year, $1,350,000 must be transferred from the general fund into this account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the operating expenses of the commission and for purposes set forth in subsection (3) of this section. Only the commission or the commission's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission has the authority to receive such gifts, grants, and endowments from public or private sources as may be made from time to time in trust or otherwise for the use and purpose of regulating or supporting nonprofit race meets as set forth in RCW 67.16.130 and 67.16.105(1); such gifts, grants, and endowments must also be deposited into the horse racing commission operating account and expended according to the terms of such gift, grant, or endowment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expenditures from the account must be used for the operating expenses of the commission, with the remaining amount distributed annually as follows:</p>

When determining how to allocate the funds available for these purposes, the Washington horse racing commission must give first consideration to uses that regulate and assist the nonprofit race meets and equine health research. These expenditures may occur only when sufficient funds remain for the continued operations of the horse racing commission after the payment of the horseracing integrity and safety authority gross assessment costs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2024, and annually thereafter, the commission must report to the appropriate committees of the legislature on the use of grant funds and criteria used to determine grant awards established in subsection (3) of this section and uses of funds distributed to the commission for operating expenses.</p>
