# SB 6201 - Alcohol sale to minors/civil

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6201.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that preventing sales of alcohol to minors is a vital public health effort. However, the penalties associated with underage sale vary depending upon the seller's occupation or location. While servers and bartenders have administrative penalty options that are a component of the mandatory alcohol server training, store clerks do not and instead receive a citation for a gross misdemeanor.

The likelihood that these charges are filed varies by county, leaving some with no penalty at all, and others with a criminal record that may hamper their ability to find another job.

The legislature finds that retaining the criminal penalty is warranted in cases of intentional or repeat sales to minors. However, the legislature also finds that adding the option for administrative penalties would harmonize the penalties for store clerks with restaurant servers, and for store clerks found to have sold tobacco products to minors.

The legislature therefore finds that enabling the ability for the liquor and cannabis board to issue administrative penalties and creating an escalating schedule of monetary fines, would reduce geographic disparities as well as reducing the number of people with criminal records. The legislature further finds that this would not harm public health or expand youth access.

## Section 2
1. It is unlawful for any person to sell, give, or otherwise supply liquor to any person under the age of 21 years or permit any person under that age to consume liquor on his or her premises or on any premises under his or her control. For the purposes of this subsection, "premises" includes real property, houses, buildings, and other structures, and motor vehicles and watercraft. A violation of this subsection is a gross misdemeanor punishable as provided for in chapter 9A.20 RCW.

2. The board may impose civil penalties as set forth in this section on individuals for the sale, gift, or otherwise supply of liquor to any person under the age of 21 occurring from a business licensed by the board under this chapter, and by a person performing acts of employment on behalf of the business. The board may impose a civil penalty in lieu of issuing a criminal citation under subsection (1) of this section.

    a. Any civil penalty imposed by the board may not be in addition to criminal enforcement, and the board may not issue a criminal citation in any matter in which it issues a civil penalty.

    b. Nothing in this section prevents criminal enforcement in lieu of a civil penalty for continued violations, or violations involving intentional sales of, or knowingly furnishing, alcohol to a person under the age of 21 years.

    c. Nothing in this section prevents enforcement using provisions of RCW 66.20.300 through 66.20.350 when a person holds an alcohol server permit.

    d. The monetary penalty that the board may impose based upon one or more violations under this section may not exceed the following:

        ii. $400 for a second violation occurring within three years; and

        iii. $500 for a third, or subsequent, violation occurring within three years.

    e. The board may develop and offer a class for retail clerks and use this class in lieu of a monetary penalty for the clerk's first violation.

    f. The board may seek injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this chapter. The board may initiate legal action to collect civil penalties imposed under this chapter if they have not been paid within 30 days after imposition. In any action filed by the board under this chapter, the court may, in addition to any other relief, award the board reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

    g. All proceedings under this section must be conducted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.
