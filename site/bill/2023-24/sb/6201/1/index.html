<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that preventing sales of alcohol to minors is a vital public health effort. However, the penalties associated with underage sale vary depending upon the seller's occupation or location. While servers and bartenders have administrative penalty options that are a component of the mandatory alcohol server training, store clerks do not and instead receive a citation for a gross misdemeanor.</p>
<p>The likelihood that these charges are filed varies by county, leaving some with no penalty at all, and others with a criminal record that may hamper their ability to find another job.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that retaining the criminal penalty is warranted in cases of intentional or repeat sales to minors. However, the legislature also finds that adding the option for administrative penalties would harmonize the penalties for store clerks with restaurant servers, and for store clerks found to have sold tobacco products to minors.</p>
<p>The legislature therefore finds that enabling the ability for the liquor and cannabis board to issue administrative penalties and creating an escalating schedule of monetary fines, would reduce geographic disparities as well as reducing the number of people with criminal records. The legislature further finds that this would not harm public health or expand youth access.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
