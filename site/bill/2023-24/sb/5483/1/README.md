# SB 5483 - Digital processing services

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5483.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that chapter 535, Laws of 2009, established the taxation of electronically transferred goods and services. In that act, the legislature established that payment processing and data processing, such as check processing, image processing, form processing, payroll processing, claim processing, and similar activities, are services, not sales at retail. While these services are still the core of Washington financial institutions, additional capabilities for customers of banks and credit unions to access their financial resources remotely have been incorporated, most recently in response to the COVID-19 health crisis. As a result, there is ambiguity regarding the classification of these digital processing services, which the legislature intends to dispel with this act.

## Section 2
