2. The commission may accept any money or property donated, devised, or bequeathed to it that is donated for the purpose of funding a class of the basic law enforcement academy. The commission is prohibited from considering any input on the commission's policy decisions or curricula from any person who has donated, devised, or bequeathed property under this subsection. The commission may determine the value of any property donated, devised, or bequeathed for the purpose of recognizing basic law enforcement academy class donations in this section.
