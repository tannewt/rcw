<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that youth development programs have provided after-school, summer, mentoring, and wraparound supports to Washington children and youth for over 100 years.</p>
<p>Youth development programs: Provide caring adults, structured and unstructured learning, and development activities; assist students in developing postsecondary and career pathways; and provide a safe and supportive environment outside of the classroom, in the school settings, the community, and the home. The legislature further finds that youth development programs have demonstrated impact and research to show that programs can improve academic and social-emotional outcomes and increase the chances that disengaged students will reengage with school.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the afterschool alliance America after 3PM report showed that 64 percent of parents in Washington state reported after-school programs as too expensive in 2020, compared to 39 percent in 2014. Additionally, 49 percent of parents reported that after-school programs were not available in their community in 2020. In the 2021 Washington healthy youth survey, teens of color were less likely to report access to out-of-school activities and service clubs than their white peers.</p>
<p>The legislature declares that youth development programs have been and continue to be essential to healthy and more equitable communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these programs: Provided responsive child care, educational programming, homework support, and mentoring; delivered basic need and homework packets; and assisted students with technology issues in the home. Many youth development programs were providing synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities for children in child care and for many youth struggling with or lacking access to virtual learning from their K-12 school home. Yet, no state agency has purview of or a comprehensive system of support for youth development programming, which became very apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The legislature therefore resolves to create the office of youth development in the department of children, youth, and families to administer grant programs to youth development programs, agencies, and organizations and to administer services designed to increase public access to youth development programs.</p>
