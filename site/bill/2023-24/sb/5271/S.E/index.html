<p>1.</p>
<p>In any case in which the department finds that a birthing center has failed or refused to comply with the requirements of this chapter, the standards or rules adopted under this chapter, or other applicable state or federal statutes or rules regulating birthing centers, the department may take one or more of the actions identified in this section, except as otherwise limited in this section.</p>
<pre><code>a. When the department determines the birthing center has previously been subject to an enforcement action for the same or similar type of violation of the same statute or rule, or has been given any previous statement of deficiency that included the same or similar type of violation of the same or similar statute or rule, or when the birthing center failed to correct noncompliance with a statute or rule by a date established or agreed to by the department, the department may impose reasonable conditions on a license. Conditions may include correction within a specified amount of time, training, or hiring a department-approved consultant if the birthing center cannot demonstrate to the department that it has access to sufficient internal expertise. If the department determines that the violations constitute immediate jeopardy, the conditions may be imposed immediately in accordance with subsection (2) of this section.

b. In accordance with the authority the department has under RCW 43.70.095, the department may assess a civil fine of up to $3,000 per violation on a birthing center licensed under this chapter when the department determines the birthing center has previously been subject to an enforcement action for the same or similar type of violation of the same statute or rule, or has been given any previous statement of deficiency that included the same or similar type of violation of the same or similar statute or rule, or when the birthing center failed to correct noncompliance with a statute or rule by a date established or agreed to by the department.

    i. Proceeds from these fines may only be used by the department to offset costs associated with licensing and enforcement of birthing centers.

    ii. The department shall adopt in rules under this chapter specific fine amounts in relation to the severity of the noncompliance and at an adequate level to be a deterrent to future noncompliance.

    iii. If a birthing center is aggrieved by the department's action of assessing civil fines, the licensee has the right to appeal under RCW 43.70.095.

c. The department may suspend a specific category or categories of services or care or birthing rooms within the birthing center as related to the violation by imposing a limited stop service. This may only be done if the department finds that noncompliance results in immediate jeopardy.

    i. Prior to imposing a limited stop service, the department shall provide a birthing center written notification upon identifying deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. The birthing center shall have 24 hours from notification to develop and implement a department-approved plan to correct the deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. If the deficient practices or conditions that constitute immediate jeopardy are not verified by the department as having been corrected within the same 24-hour period, the department may issue the limited stop service.

    ii. When the department imposes a limited stop service, the birthing center may not provide the services in the category or categories subject to the limited stop service to any new or existing patients, unless otherwise allowed by the department, until the limited stop service is terminated.

    iii. The department shall conduct a follow-up inspection within five business days or within the time period requested by the birthing center if more than five business days is needed to verify the violation necessitating the limited stop service has been corrected.

    iv. The limited stop service shall be terminated when:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The department verifies the violation necessitating the limited stop service has been corrected or the department determines that the birthing center has taken intermediate action to address the immediate jeopardy; and</p>
<p>(B) The birthing center establishes the ability to maintain correction of the violation previously found deficient.</p>
<pre><code>d. The department may suspend new admissions to the birthing center by imposing a stop placement. This may only be done if the department finds that noncompliance results in immediate jeopardy and is not confined to a specific category or categories of patients or a specific area of the birthing center.

    i. Prior to imposing a stop placement, the department shall provide a birthing center written notification upon identifying deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. The birthing center shall have 24 hours from notification to develop and implement a department-approved plan to correct the deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. If the deficient practices or conditions that constitute immediate jeopardy are not verified by the department as having been corrected within the same 24-hour period, the department may issue the stop placement.

    ii. When the department imposes a stop placement, the birthing center may not admit any new patients until the stop placement is terminated.

    iii. The department shall conduct a follow-up inspection within five business days or within the time period requested by the birthing center if more than five business days is needed to verify the violation necessitating the stop placement has been corrected.

    iv. The stop placement shall be terminated when:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The department verifies the violation necessitating the stop placement has been corrected or the department determines that the birthing center has taken intermediate action to address the immediate jeopardy; and</p>
<p>(B) The birthing center establishes the ability to maintain correction of the violation previously found deficient.</p>

When the department determines the ambulatory surgical facility has previously been subject to an enforcement action for the same or similar type of violation of the same statute or rule, or has been given any previous statement of deficiency that included the same or similar type of violation of the same or similar statute or rule, or when the ambulatory surgical facility failed to correct noncompliance with a statute or rule by a date established or agreed to by the department, the department may impose reasonable conditions on a license. Conditions may include correction within a specified amount of time, training, or hiring a department-approved consultant if the ambulatory surgical facility cannot demonstrate to the department that it has access to sufficient internal expertise.

    i. In accordance with the authority the department has under RCW 43.70.095, the department may assess a civil fine of up to $7,500 per violation on an ambulatory surgical facility licensed under this chapter when the department determines the ambulatory surgical facility has previously been subject to an enforcement action for the same or similar type of violation of the same statute or rule, or has been given any previous statement of deficiency that included the same or similar type of violation of the same or similar statute or rule, or when the ambulatory surgical facility failed to correct noncompliance with a statute or rule by a date established or agreed to by the department.

    ii. Proceeds from these fines may only be used by the department to offset costs associated with licensing and enforcement of ambulatory surgical facilities.

    iii. If a licensee is aggrieved by the department's action of assessing civil fines, the licensee has the right to appeal under RCW 43.70.095.

    iv. The department shall adopt in rules under this chapter specific fine amounts in relation to:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The severity of the noncompliance and at an adequate level to be a deterrent to future noncompliance; and</p>
<p>(B) The number of surgical procedures performed by an ambulatory surgical facility on an annual basis as identified by the facility at the time of licensure or renewal in the following categories:</p>
<p>(I) Performs 1,000 or fewer surgical procedures;</p>
<p>(II) Performs between 1,001 and 5,000 surgical procedures; and</p>
<p>(III) Performs more than 5,000 surgical procedures.</p>
<pre><code>c. The department may suspend a specific category or categories of services or care or operating rooms or recovery rooms within the ambulatory surgical facility as related to the violation by imposing a limited stop service. This may only be done if the department finds that noncompliance results in immediate jeopardy.

    i. Prior to imposing a limited stop service, the department shall provide an ambulatory surgical facility written notification upon identifying deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. The ambulatory surgical facility shall have 24 hours from notification to develop and implement a department-approved plan to correct the deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. If the deficient practices or conditions that constitute immediate jeopardy are not verified by the department as having been corrected within the same 24-hour period, the department may issue the limited stop service.

    ii. When the department imposes a limited stop service, the ambulatory surgical facility may not provide the services in the category or categories subject to the limited stop service to any new or existing individuals, unless otherwise allowed by the department, until the limited stop service is terminated.

    iii. The department shall conduct a follow-up inspection within five business days or within the time period requested by the ambulatory surgical facility if more than five business days is needed to verify the violation necessitating the limited stop service has been corrected.

    iv. The limited stop service shall be terminated when:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The department verifies the violation necessitating the limited stop service has been corrected or the department determines that the ambulatory surgical facility has taken intermediate action to address the immediate jeopardy; and</p>
<p>(B) The ambulatory surgical facility establishes the ability to maintain correction of the violation previously found deficient.</p>
<pre><code>d. The department may suspend new admissions to the ambulatory surgical facility by imposing a stop placement. This may only be done if the department finds that noncompliance results in immediate jeopardy and is not confined to a specific category or categories of patients or a specific area of the ambulatory surgical facility.

    i. Prior to imposing a stop placement, the department shall provide an ambulatory surgical facility written notification upon identifying deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. The ambulatory surgical facility shall have 24 hours from notification to develop and implement a department-approved plan to correct the deficient practices or conditions that constitute an immediate jeopardy. If the deficient practices or conditions that constitute immediate jeopardy are not verified by the department as having been corrected within the same 24-hour period, the department may issue the stop placement.

    ii. When the department imposes a stop placement, the ambulatory surgical facility may not admit any new patients until the stop placement is terminated.

    iii. The department shall conduct a follow-up inspection within five business days or within the time period requested by the ambulatory surgical facility if more than five business days is needed to verify the violation necessitating the stop placement has been corrected.

    iv. The stop placement shall be terminated when:
</code></pre>
<p>(A) The department verifies the violation necessitating the stop placement has been corrected or the department determines that the ambulatory surgical facility has taken intermediate action to address the immediate jeopardy; and</p>

In determining the public interest, the commission shall consider the following factors:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>maintenance of effective controls against diversion of controlled substances into other than legitimate medical, scientific, research, or industrial channels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compliance with applicable state and local law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promotion of technical advances in the art of manufacturing controlled substances and the development of new substances;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any convictions of the applicant under any laws of another country or federal or state laws relating to any controlled substance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>past experience in the manufacture or distribution of controlled substances, and the existence in the applicant's establishment of effective controls against diversion of controlled substances into other than legitimate medical, scientific, research, or industrial channels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>furnishing by the applicant of false or fraudulent material in any application filed under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suspension or revocation of the applicant's federal registration to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances as authorized by federal law; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other factors relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration under subsection (1) of this section does not entitle a registrant to manufacture or distribute controlled substances included in Schedule I or II other than those specified in the registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practitioners must be registered, or exempted under RCW 69.50.302(4), to dispense any controlled substances or to conduct research with controlled substances included in Schedules II through V if they are authorized to dispense or conduct research under the law of this state. The commission need not require separate registration under this Article for practitioners engaging in research with nonnarcotic substances included in Schedules II through V where the registrant is already registered under this Article in another capacity. Practitioners registered under federal law to conduct research with substances included in Schedule I may conduct research with substances included in Schedule I within this state upon furnishing the commission evidence of that federal registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A manufacturer or distributor registered under the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C.

<li>
<p>This chapter and chapter 18.64 RCW govern the denial of registrations and the discipline of registrations issued under RCW 69.50.303. The uniform disciplinary act, chapter 18.130 RCW, governs unlicensed practice of persons required to obtain a registration under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to any other grounds, the commission may take action against the registration, or exemption from registration, under RCW 69.50.303 to manufacture, distribute,  dispense, or conduct research with a controlled substance  upon finding that the registrant has:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>furnished false or fraudulent material information in any application filed under this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>been convicted of a felony under any state or federal law relating to any controlled substance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had the registrant's federal registration suspended or revoked and is no longer authorized by federal law to manufacture, distribute,  dispense, or conduct research with controlled substances; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>committed acts that would render registration under RCW 69.50.303 inconsistent with the public interest as determined under that section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may limit revocation or suspension of a registration to the particular controlled substance or schedule of controlled substances, with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commission suspends or revokes a registration, all controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at the time of suspension or the effective date of the revocation order may be placed under seal. No disposition may be made of substances under seal until the time for taking an appeal has elapsed or until all appeals have been concluded unless a court, upon application, orders the sale of perishable substances and the deposit of the proceeds of the sale with the court. Upon a revocation order becoming final, all controlled substances may be forfeited to the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission may seize or place under seal any controlled substance owned or possessed by a registrant whose registration has expired or who has ceased to practice or do business in the manner contemplated by the registration. The controlled substance must be held for the benefit of the registrant or the registrant's successor in interest. The commission shall notify a registrant, or the registrant's successor in interest, who has any controlled substance seized or placed under seal, of the procedures to be followed to secure the return of the controlled substance and the conditions under which it will be returned. The commission may not dispose of any controlled substance seized or placed under seal under this subsection until the expiration of 180 days after the controlled substance was seized or placed under seal. The costs incurred by the commission in seizing, placing under seal, maintaining custody, and disposing of any controlled substance under this subsection may be recovered from the registrant, any proceeds obtained from the disposition of the controlled substance, or from both. Any balance remaining after the costs have been recovered from the proceeds of any disposition must be delivered to the registrant or the registrant's successor in interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall promptly notify the drug enforcement administration of all orders restricting, suspending, or revoking registration and all forfeitures of controlled substances.</p>
