## Section 1
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in section 2, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (section 2 of this act). The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes the tax preference in this act as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers and to create jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a) and (c).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide a consistent benefit for private sector employers to invest in the training and upskilling of current and future employees thereby increasing employment.

4. To measure the effectiveness of the tax preference in section 2 of this act, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate the changes in employment for employers claiming the tax credit under section 2 of this act and the types of training and education methods used by these employers.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee shall use the annual tax performance reports submitted to the department of revenue under section 2 of this act.
