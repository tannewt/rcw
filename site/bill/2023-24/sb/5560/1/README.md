[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5560.pdf)

## Section 1
1. By January 1, 2024, the department, in consultation with relevant groups and agencies, shall develop a comprehensive plan aimed at improving older driver safety. The plan must include, but is not limited to:

    a. A draft of the rules associated with the plan;

    b. An implementation schedule for the components of the plan;

    c. Any additional recommended statutory changes required to implement the plan; and

    d. Detailed information on how each component of the plan improves the safety associated with older drivers, while preserving the maximum level of older driver independence and privacy.

2. By January 1, 2025, the department must adopt rules implementing phase one of a comprehensive set of policy changes designed to improve older driver safety. The rules may include, but are not limited to:

    a. Creating a voluntary program by which an older driver may voluntarily surrender their driver's license before the expiration date and receive a no cost identicard; and

    b. Reducing the length of time by which the driver's license of an older driver expires.

3. By January 1, 2026, the department must adopt rules implementing phase two of a comprehensive set of policy changes designed to improve older driver safety. The rules may include, but are not limited to:

    a. Requiring as a condition of initial issuance or renewal of a driver's license of an older driver that they successfully complete an older driver knowledge and skills refresher course that emphasizes the unique issues faced by older drivers;

    b. Imposing additional restrictions or conditions on high-risk older drivers that may include, but are not limited to, time and place driving restrictions, and requirements for the installation and the use of driver monitoring technology in the vehicle while operated by the older driver; and

    c. Developing an assessment of competency to determine a driver's potential risk to themselves or others when operating a motor vehicle so the department may make informed decisions on appropriate courses of action within the older driver program.

## Section 2
"Older driver" means a driver receiving an initial issuance of a driver's license or renewing the driver's license after the age of 70.

## Section 3
"Older driver knowledge and skills refresher course" means a course of instruction in traffic safety education intended for older drivers that is approved by the department consisting of classroom instruction, online, or behind-the-wheel instruction that follows the approved curriculum as determined in rule. The department may contract with one or more providers to deliver the older driver knowledge and skills refresher course and must ensure that the courses are reasonably available to people throughout the state, including overburdened communities.

## Section 4
"High-risk older driver" means a driver over the age of 70 and as determined based on any combination of age and the number of traffic infractions, moving violations, or collisions combined with the results of assessments by department staff or medical professionals to warrant the imposition of driving restrictions and conditions as specified in rules adopted by the department pursuant to section 1 of this act.

## Section 5
1. Except as provided in subsection (4) , (5), or (6) of this section, every driver's license expires on the eighth anniversary of the licensee's birthdate following the issuance of the license.

2. A person may renew a license on or before the expiration date by submitting an application as prescribed by the department and paying a fee of $72. This fee includes the fee for the required photograph.

3. A person renewing a driver's license more than 60 days after the license has expired shall pay a penalty fee of $10 in addition to the renewal fee, unless the license expired when:

    a. The person was outside the state and the licensee renews the license within 60 days after returning to this state; or

    b. The person was incapacitated and the licensee renews the license within 60 days after the termination of the incapacity.

4. The department may issue or renew a driver's license for a period other than eight years, or may extend by mail or electronic commerce a license that has already been issued. The fee for a driver's license issued or renewed for a period other than eight years, or that has been extended by mail or electronic commerce, is $9 for each year that the license is issued, renewed, or extended. The department must offer the option to issue or renew a driver's license for six years in addition to the eight year issuance. The department may adopt any rules as are necessary to carry out this subsection.

5. A driver's license that includes a hazardous materials endorsement under chapter 46.25 RCW may expire on an anniversary of the licensee's birthdate other than the eighth year following issuance or renewal of the license in order to match, as nearly as possible, the validity of certification from the federal transportation security administration that the licensee has been determined not to pose a security risk. The fee for a driver's license issued or renewed for a period other than eight years is nine dollars for each year that the license is issued or renewed, not including any endorsement fees. The department may adjust the expiration date of a driver's license that has previously been issued to conform to the provisions of this subsection if a hazardous materials endorsement is added to the license subsequent to its issuance. If the validity of the driver's license is extended, the licensee must pay a fee of $9 for each year that the license is extended.

6. For initial driver's license issuances or renewals after January 1, 2025, the department may establish an earlier expiration date for older drivers.

7. The department may adopt any rules as are necessary to carry out this section.
