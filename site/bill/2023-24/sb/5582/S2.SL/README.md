# SB 5582 - Nurse supply

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5582-S2.SL.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that nurses are essential to the operation of the state's health care system. Further, the legislature finds that the gap between demand for nurses and an available workforce continues to widen. Nursing professions continue to rank among the highest demand occupations in the state with the number of unfilled openings ranking near the top of all professional categories each month. The legislature finds that the need for nurses is particularly acute in rural hospital and clinical settings as well as long-term care facilities. Further, the legislature finds that there is a need to expand nursing credential opportunities through the expansion of existing postsecondary programs, the provision of adequate compensation for nurse educators, the creation of new and innovative approaches to health care credentials, the creation and expansion of proven pathways to health care careers within the K-12 system, and the streamlining of administrative requirements in the approval of new, high quality nursing education opportunities.

## Section 2
1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the community and technical colleges shall develop a plan to train more nurses over the next four years. The state board shall consult with health care employers, local workforce development councils, and exclusive bargaining representatives of nursing professions in development of the plan. The plan must place particular emphasis on training health professionals in key shortage areas, including rural communities. In designing a plan, the state board must prioritize expanding existing programs or creating new ones which:

    a. Create new capacity to train licensed practical nurses and registered nurses through apprenticeship programs, certificate programs, associates degrees in nursing, and baccalaureate degrees in nursing;

    b. Expand training opportunities for rural and underserved students;

    c. Demonstrate or are expected to demonstrate long-term sustainability; and

    d. Expand partnerships between employers and exclusive bargaining representatives through joint workforce development initiatives including apprenticeships.

2. The state board for community and technical colleges shall submit a report, in accordance with RCW 43.01.036, to the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1, 2024, with the details of the plan to increase capacity in nursing education programs.

3. This section expires August 1, 2025.

## Section 3
Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the community and technical colleges shall design and implement an online curriculum and pathway to earn a licensed practical nursing credential. The college board shall select two colleges, one on either side of the crest of the Cascade mountains, to design and implement the online curriculum. The curriculum may include use of a mobile skills lab or other innovative approaches to ensure access to training opportunities for rural students.

## Section 4
1. The home care aide to licensed practical nurse apprenticeship pathway pilot program is created. The workforce training and education coordinating board and the nursing care quality assurance commission shall jointly administer the pilot program in consultation with the department of labor and industries.

The workforce training and education coordinating board, along with the nursing care quality assurance commission, and the department of labor and industries shall submit a report, in accordance with RCW 43.01.036, to the appropriate committees of the legislature by August 1, 2025, of the status of the pilot program and policy options to scale up the licensed practical nurse apprenticeship pathway pilot program statewide. The report must examine any barriers faced by current and prospective participants in the pilot program including, but not limited to, the academic preparation needs of home care aides selected for participation in the pilot program and the availability of enrollment spots in nursing educational programs for qualified applicants.

2. This section expires August 1, 2025.

## Section 5
Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the workforce training and education coordinating board shall contract with a firm that has expertise in public relations and marketing to develop and execute a marketing plan about available training opportunities and jobs for certified nursing assistants, personal care aides, licensed practical nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and related nursing professions. The marketing plan must include targeted outreach to serve workforce needs in rural and underserved communities as well as long-term care facilities. Marketing materials containing information about educational and training opportunities should include both postsecondary degree and credential opportunities as well as apprenticeships and training opportunities provided as partnerships between employers and exclusive bargaining representatives.

## Section 6
1. The state board for community and technical colleges shall contract with a firm that has expertise in human resources consulting and health care to conduct a salary survey on nurse educator compensation.
