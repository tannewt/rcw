## Section 4
1. The governing documents may not prohibit the installation of drought resistant landscaping, pollinator habitat, including beehives compliant with local regulation, or wildfire ignition resistant landscaping. However, the governing documents may include reasonable rules regarding the placement and aesthetic appearance of drought resistant landscaping, pollinator habitat, or wildfire ignition resistant landscaping, as long as the rules do not render the use of drought resistant landscaping, pollinator habitat, or wildfire ignition resistant landscaping unreasonably costly or otherwise effectively infeasible.

2. If a property is located within the geographic designation of an order of a drought condition issued by the department of ecology under RCW 43.83B.405, an association may not sanction or impose a fine or assessment against an owner, or resident on the owner's property, for reducing or eliminating the watering of vegetation or lawns for the duration of the drought condition order.

3. Nothing in this section may be construed to prohibit or restrict the establishment and maintenance of a fire buffer within the building ignition zone.

    a. "Building ignition zone" means a building and surrounding area up to two hundred feet from the foundation.

    b. "Drought resistant landscaping" means the use of any noninvasive vegetation adapted to arid or dry conditions, stone, or landscaping rock.

"Firewise" means the firewise communities program developed by the national fire protection association, which encourages local solutions for wildfire safety by involving homeowners, community leaders, planners, developers, firefighters, and others in the effort to protect people and property from wildfire risks.

    d. "Pollinator habitat" means an area of land that is or may be developed as habitat beneficial for the feeding, nesting, and reproduction of all pollinators. "Pollinator habitat" does not include beehives, except for mason bee houses.

    e. "Wildfire ignition resistant landscaping" includes:

        i. Any landscaping tools or techniques, or noninvasive vegetation, that do not readily ignite from a flame or other ignition source; or

        ii. The use of firewise methods to reduce ignition risk in a building ignition zone.
