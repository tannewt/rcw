<p>The legislature finds that sustainable aviation fuels represent a significant opportunity to reduce emissions in the aviation sector. By requiring a growing percentage of fuel usage by private jets to be sustainable aviation fuel, the state will improve the health and quality of life for Washingtonians and stimulate the growth of the sustainable aviation fuel industry in Washington. The legislature intends to encourage and promote the development, availability, and use of sustainable aviation fuels.</p>
