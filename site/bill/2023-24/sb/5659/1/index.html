<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that renewable energy resources are a critical component to reducing overall carbon emissions. The legislature further finds it prudent to incentivize development of multiple types of renewable energy infrastructure in order to maintain energy reliability, resiliency, and security as the state transitions toward decarbonizing its energy resources. Incentivizing development of renewable and sustainable energy resources includes both electric and gaseous fuel resources and should be made widely available to all interests, regardless of business structure or type. The legislature further finds that gaseous fuels are an important energy resource and intends to support the development of this resource as part of a diversified clean energy strategy that utilizes existing infrastructure that has been built out over the years through the regulated utility compact embodied in chapter 80.24 RCW. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide tax incentives to encourage the development of increased methane capture and processing for use as renewable natural gas and provide explicit regulatory certainty that will encourage utilities invest in carbon reduction, capture, and offset efforts on behalf of their customers.</p>

<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in sections 3 and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 3 and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to promote the development of renewable natural gas projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a review finds that the total number of methane emission capture projects increase in number over the time of adoption of this exemption and the majority of those projects process the methane into renewable natural gas that is sold in Washington the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of this tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.</p>
