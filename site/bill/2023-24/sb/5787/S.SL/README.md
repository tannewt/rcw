3. A person may not waive the provisions of this section.

## Section 7
1. A nontestamentary estate planning document or a signature on a nontestamentary estate planning document may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.

2. If other law of this state requires a nontestamentary estate planning document to be in writing, an electronic record of the document satisfies the requirement.

3. If other law of this state requires a signature on a nontestamentary estate planning document, an electronic signature satisfies the requirement.

    a. A court order mandating acceptance of the document or signature; and

    b. Liability for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in any action or proceeding that confirms the validity of the document or signature or mandates acceptance of the document or signature.

## Section 8
1. An electronic nontestamentary estate planning document or electronic signature on an electronic nontestamentary estate planning document is attributable to a person if it was the act of the person. The act of the person may be shown in any manner, including by showing the efficacy of a security procedure applied to determine the person to which the electronic record or electronic signature was attributable.

2. The effect of attribution to a person under subsection (1) of this section of a document or signature is determined from the context and surrounding circumstances at the time of its creation, execution, or adoption and as provided by other law.

## Section 9
If other law of this state requires a signature or record to be notarized, acknowledged, verified, or made under oath, the requirement is satisfied with respect to an electronic nontestamentary estate planning document if an individual authorized to perform the notarization, acknowledgment, verification, or oath attaches or logically associates the individual's electronic signature on the document together with all other information required to be included under the other law. The individual making the statement or executing the signature may appear physically or, as provided in RCW 42.45.280, remotely.

2. If other law of this state bases the validity of a nontestamentary estate planning document on whether it is signed, witnessed, or attested by another individual in the presence of the individual signing the document, the presence requirement is satisfied if the individuals are in each other's electronic presence, as defined in RCW 11.02.005.

## Section 11
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, if other law of this state requires an electronic nontestamentary estate planning document to be retained, transmitted, copied, or filed, the requirement is satisfied by retaining, transmitting, copying, or filing an electronic record that:

    a. Accurately reflects the information in the document after it was first generated in final form as an electronic record or under section 12 of this act; and

    b. Remains accessible to the extent required by the other law.

2. A requirement under subsection (1) of this section to retain a record does not apply to information the sole purpose of which is to enable the record to be sent, communicated, or received.

3. If other law of this state requires a nontestamentary estate planning document to be presented or retained in its original form, or provides consequences if a nontestamentary estate planning document is not presented or retained in its original form, an electronic record retained in accordance with subsection (1) of this section satisfies the other law.
