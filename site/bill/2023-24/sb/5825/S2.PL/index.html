<p>Any suitable person over the age of 21 years, or any parent under the age of 21 years or, if the petition is for appointment of a professional guardian or conservator, any individual or guardianship or conservatorship service that meets any certification requirements established by the administrator for the courts, may, if not otherwise disqualified, be appointed guardian or conservator of a person subject to guardianship, conservatorship, or both. A financial institution subject to the jurisdiction of the department of financial institutions and authorized to exercise trust powers, and a federally chartered financial institution when authorized to do so, may be appointed to act as a guardian or conservator of a person subject to guardianship, conservatorship, or both without having to meet the certification requirements established by the administrator for the courts. No person is qualified to serve as a guardian or conservator who is:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A person whom the court finds unsuitable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a guardian, or conservator is not a certified professional guardian, conservator, or financial institution authorized under this section, the guardian or conservator must complete any standardized training video or web cast for lay guardians or conservators made available by the administrative office of the courts and the superior court where the petition is filed unless granted a waiver by the court. The training video or web cast must be provided at no cost to the guardian, or conservator.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If a petitioner requests the appointment of a specific individual to act as a guardian or conservator, the petition for guardianship or conservatorship must include evidence of the successful completion of the required training video or web cast by the proposed guardian or conservator. The superior court may defer the completion of the training requirement to a date no later than ninety days after appointment if the petitioner requests expedited appointment due to emergent circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no person is identified to be appointed guardian or conservator at the time the petition is filed, then the court must require that the petitioner identify within 30 days from the filing of the petition a specific individual to act as guardian or conservator subject to the training requirements set forth herein. If the petitioner fails to identify a guardian or conservator within 30 days of filing, the court shall dismiss the guardianship or conservatorship.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Where the person subject to guardianship or conservatorship is a department of social and health services client, or health care authority client, and is required to contribute a portion of their income towards the cost of long-term care services or room and board, the amount of compensation or reimbursement shall not exceed the amount allowed by the department of social and health services or health care authority by rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the person subject to guardianship or conservatorship receives guardianship, conservatorships, or other protective services from the office of public guardianship, the amount of compensation or reimbursement shall not exceed the amount allowed by the office of public guardianship.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The court, in the order appointing a court visitor, shall specify the hourly rate the court visitor may charge for his or her services, and shall specify the maximum amount the court visitor may charge without additional court review and approval. The fee shall be charged to the person subject to a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding unless the court finds that such payment would result in substantial hardship upon such person, in which case the county shall be responsible for such costs: PROVIDED, That the court may charge such fee to the petitioner, the person subject to a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding, or any person who has appeared in the action; or may allocate the fee, as it deems just.

Within three days of the later of the actual service or filing of the court visitor's statement, any party may set a hearing and file and serve a motion for an order to show cause why the court visitor should not be removed for one of the following three reasons:</p>
<ol type="i">

</li>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not later than 14 days after appointment of a guardian under RCW 11.130.305, the guardian shall give to the adult subject to guardianship and any other person entitled to notice under RCW 11.130.310 (5) or (6) or a subsequent order a copy of the order of appointment and a statement of the rights of the adult subject to guardianship and procedures to seek relief if the adult is denied those rights. The statement must be in at least sixteen-point font, in plain language, and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the adult subject to guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify the adult subject to guardianship of the right to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Seek termination or modification of the guardianship, or removal of the guardian, and choose an attorney to represent the adult in these matters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be involved in decisions affecting the adult, including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities, or social interactions, to the extent reasonably feasible;</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The guardian has been authorized by the court by specific order to restrict communications, visits, or interactions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A protective order or protective arrangement instead of guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant physical, psychological, or financial harm to the adult, and the restriction is:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For a period of not more than seven business days if the person has a relative or preexisting social relationship with the adult; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a period of not more than sixty days if the person does not have a relative or preexisting social relationship with the adult;</p>

<li>
<p>The court may appoint a court visitor to review a report under this section or conservator's plan under RCW 11.130.510, interview the individual subject to conservatorship or conservator, or investigate any other matter involving the conservatorship.

</li>
<li>
<p>If the court approves a report filed under this section, the order approving the report shall contain a conservatorship summary or accompanied by a conservatorship summary in the form or substantially in the same form as set forth in RCW 11.130.665.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report filed under this section discharges the conservator from all liabilities, claims, and causes of action by a person given notice of the report and the hearing as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.</p>
