<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that unsheltered homelessness for youth poses a serious threat to their health and safety. The Trevor project has found that one in three transgender youth report attempting suicide. Homelessness amongst transgender youth can further endanger an already at-risk population. The legislature further finds that barriers to accessing shelter can place a chilling effect on exiting unsheltered homelessness and therefore create additional risk and dangers for youth. Youth seeking certain medical services are especially at risk and vulnerable. Therefore, the legislature intends to remove barriers to accessing temporary, licensed shelter accommodations for youth seeking certain protected health care services.</p>
