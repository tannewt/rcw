<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the current school district enrichment levy model has caused unintentional harm to school districts, creating financial distress with significant negative impacts on district budgets, staff, and students. The current model has negatively impacted districts as they struggle to hire and retain staff due to the high cost of living, rising inflation, and competition from other employers.</p>
<p>The legislature acknowledges that Washington adopted a regionalized school salary model for state-funded school employees, but did not adopt a regionalized school salary model for local levy-funded school employees.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that school districts have struggled to hire and retain qualified staff due to unforeseen consequences of the current school salary model. Furthermore, the legislature finds that aligning levy-funded school district salaries and the state salary model would allow affected school districts to remedy staffing issues locally at no cost to state taxpayers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to remedy the current enrichment levy model by aligning state and local levy-funded school district staff salaries beginning in 2025.</p>
