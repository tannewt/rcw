# SB 5447 - Alternative jet fuel

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5447-S.PL.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature intends to use funds from the climate commitment act to promote the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels, thereby growing the clean energy sector, addressing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating family wage manufacturing jobs in Washington. Sustainable aviation fuels represent the most significant near and midterm opportunity for aviation to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The use of sustainable aviation fuels will also improve air quality for airport workers and communities surrounding airports. While many efforts are underway to advance the use of sustainable aviation fuels, this act is intended to assist and accelerate those efforts.

## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

The University of Washington may access and use any data necessary to complete the reporting requirements of this section.

2. To facilitate the calculation required in subsection (1) of this section, an international airport owned by a port district in a county with a population greater than 1,500,000 must report to the University of Washington the total annual volume of conventional and alternative jet fuel used for flights departing the airport by July 1, 2024, and July 1st of each year until such time as the joint legislative audit and review committee has completed its final report on the tax preferences contained in sections 9 through 12 of this act.

## Section 8
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 9 through 12, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 9 through 12 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to improve industry competitiveness as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(b).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage the production and use of alternative jet fuels. It is also the legislature's intent to support the development of the alternative jet fuels industry in Washington by providing targeted tax relief for such businesses.

    c. That the alternative jet fuel industry has created measurable economic growth in Washington.

5. The review conducted by the joint legislative audit and review committee must include a racial equity analysis on air travel-related pollution in communities near an international airport owned by a port district in a county with a population greater than 1,500,000.

6. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may access and use data from an international airport owned by a port district in a county with a population greater than 1,500,000, the University of Washington, reports compiled by the Washington State University pursuant to section 7 of this act, and any other data collected by the state as it deems necessary.

7. The joint legislative audit and review committee must complete a preliminary report by December 1, 2032.
