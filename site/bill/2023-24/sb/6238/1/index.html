The person is entitled to assistance for the payment of all or a portion of the amount of excess and regular real property taxes imposed on the person's residence in the year in which a claim is filed in accordance with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The claimant must meet all requirements for an exemption for the residence under RCW 84.36.381, other than the income limits under RCW 84.36.381.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The person making the claim must be:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>62 years of age or older on December 31st of the year in which the claim is filed, or must have been, at the time of filing, retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability; and</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>A person who otherwise qualifies under this section is entitled to assistance in an amount equal to regular and excess property taxes imposed on the difference between the value of the residence eligible for exemption under RCW 84.36.381(5) and:</p>

<ol type="a">
