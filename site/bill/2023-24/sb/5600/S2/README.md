The program is established to protect public safety and welfare under the authority of the state to regulate telecommunications under Article XII, section 19 of the state Constitution. The purpose of the program is to support continued provision of basic telecommunications services under rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission and the provision, enhancement, and maintenance of broadband services, recognizing that, historically, the incumbent public network functions to provide all communications services including, but not limited to, voice and broadband services.

2. Under the program, eligible communications providers may receive distributions from the universal communications services account created in RCW 80.36.690 in exchange for the affirmative agreement to provide continued telecommunications services under the rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission under this chapter, and broadband services, for the period covered by the distribution. The commission must implement and administer the program under terms and conditions established in RCW 80.36.630 through 80.36.690. Expenditures for the program may not exceed $5,000,000 per fiscal year; provided, however, that if less than $5,000,000 is expended in any fiscal year, the unexpended portion must be carried over to subsequent fiscal years and, unless fully expended, must be available for program expenditures in such subsequent fiscal years in addition to the $5,000,000 allotted for each of those subsequent fiscal years.

        ii. The communications provider has adopted a plan to provide, enhance, or maintain broadband services in its service area; and

        iii. The communications provider meets any other requirements established by the commission pertaining to the provision of communications services, including basic telecommunications services; or

    b. The communications provider demonstrates to the commission that the communications provider is able to provide the same or comparable services at the same or similar service quality standards at a lower price; and: (i) Will provide communications services to all customers in the exchange or exchanges in which it will provide service; and (ii) submits to the commission's regulation of its service as if it were the incumbent local exchange company serving the exchange or exchanges for which it seeks distribution from the account.

4. [Empty]

    a. Distributions to eligible communications providers are based on criteria established by the commission.

    b. If the program does not have sufficient funds to fully fund the distribution formula set out in (a) of this subsection, distributions must be reduced on a pro rata basis using the amounts calculated for that year's program support as the basis of the pro rata calculations.

    c. To receive a distribution under the program, an eligible communications provider must affirmatively consent to continue providing communications services to its customers under rates, terms, and conditions established by the commission pursuant to this chapter for the period covered by the distribution.

5. The program is funded from amounts deposited by the legislature in the universal communications services account established in RCW 80.36.690. The commission must operate the program within amounts appropriated for this purpose and deposited in the account.

6. The commission must periodically review the accounts and records of any communications provider that receives distributions under the program to ensure compliance with the program and monitor the providers' use of the funds.

7.

8. The commission must submit a report to the legislature that describes the number of residents benefiting from the program, the geographic areas served, the ways that the receiving companies use the funds, the distribution amounts to each company, and implications to service delivery, digital access, and availability to benefiting residents if the funding were not provided. The commission may also include any additional information and analysis that would help inform future appropriation decisions regarding the program. The report must be submitted to the fiscal committees of the legislature by December 31, 2024.
