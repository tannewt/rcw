    b. The department may not transfer an offender to participate in the graduated reentry program until the department has conducted a comprehensive assessment for substance use disorder. If the assessment indicates the offender suffers from a substance use disorder, the offender may not be transferred until the offender is enrolled in and receives substance use disorder treatment services as deemed appropriate by the department. Offenders enrolled in appropriate substance use disorder treatment services and transferred to participate in the graduated reentry program must begin receiving substance use disorder treatment services as soon as practicable after transfer to avoid any delays in treatment. Substance use disorder treatment services shall include, as deemed necessary by the department, access to medication-assisted treatment and counseling programs.

8. In the selection of offenders to participate in the graduated reentry program, and in setting, modifying, and enforcing the requirements of the graduated reentry program, the department is deemed to be performing a quasi-judicial function.

9. The department shall publish a monthly report on its website with the number of offenders who were transferred during the month to home detention as part of the graduated reentry program. The department shall submit an annual report by December 1st to the appropriate committees of the legislature with the number of offenders who were transferred to home detention as part of the graduated reentry program during the prior year.
