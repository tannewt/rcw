# SB 5662 - Cannabis employees

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5662.pdf)

## Section 1
1. Washington voters legalized recreational cannabis just 10 years ago through the passage of Initiative Measure No. 502, and in many ways the industry is still nascent. The state has taken modest steps to ensure better equity in the industry to mitigate harms done to communities that were disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs, but the state still has more work to do. Studies by respected industry publications state that a majority of frontline cannabis workers are women and people of color.

2. The liquor and cannabis board sets the number of licenses and manages the process when a retail establishment changes their licensure status through a change in ownership or a change in business location. Of the 463 active retail licenses, 143 (31 percent) have undergone some kind of change in ownership, many of them more than once. This high turnover in ownership fosters job insecurity in what is already a challenging industry.

3. The legislature finds that, given the uniqueness of an industry where the number of retail licenses are fixed by statute, where jobs are limited to those establishments with a state license, and where the ownership of those licenses has a high degree of turnover, it is necessary to ensure job retention in a continually changing industry.

2. Regarding whether an individual is an employee, the employer bears the burden of proof that the individual is, as a matter of economic reality, in business for oneself rather than dependent upon the alleged employer.

## Section 4
1. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, employers covered under this chapter are limited to those who own, control, or operate a cannabis business in the state, including but not limited to integrated enterprises.

2. Separate entities that form an integrated enterprise will be considered a single employer under this chapter.

Employers shall display the poster in English and in the primary language of the employee(s) at the particular workplace. Employers shall make a good faith effort to determine the primary languages of the employees at that particular workplace. If display of the poster is not feasible, including situations when the employee works remotely or does not have a regular workplace or jobsite, employers may provide the poster on an individual basis in an employee's primary language in physical or electronic format that is reasonably conspicuous and accessible.

## Section 8

2. Records required by this section must be retained for a period of three years.

3. If the employer fails to retain adequate records required under this section, a presumption is created, rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer violated this chapter for the periods for which records were not retained for each employee for whom records were not retained.

## Section 9
1. An employer or any other person may not interfere with, restrain, deny, or attempt to deny the exercise of any right protected under this section.

2. An employer or any other person may not take any adverse action against any person because the person has exercised in good faith the rights protected under this section. Rights protected under this section include but are not limited to the right to:

    a. Make inquiries about protected rights under this chapter;

    c. Inform the person's employer, the person's legal counsel, a union or similar organization, or any other person about an alleged violation of this chapter;

4. There is a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if the employer or any other person takes an adverse action against a person within 90 days of the person's exercise of rights protected in this section. However, in the case of seasonal employment that ended before the close of the 90-calendar day period, the presumption also applies if the employer fails to rehire a former employee at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The employer may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was taken for a permissible purpose.

5. Proof of retaliation under this section is sufficient upon a showing that the employer or any other person has taken an adverse action against a person and the person's exercise of rights protected in this section was a motivating factor in the adverse action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such protected activity.

6. The protections under this section apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith alleges violations of this chapter.

7. A complaint or other communication by any person to the department triggers the protections of this section regardless of whether the complaint or communication is in writing or makes explicit reference to this chapter.

2. An employee or other person may report to the department any suspected violation of this chapter. The department shall encourage reporting pursuant to this section by taking the following measures:

    a. The department shall keep confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the name and other identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation.

    b. If the precise amount of unpaid compensation cannot be determined due to a respondent's failure to produce records, or if a respondent produces records in a manner or form which makes timely determination of the amount of unpaid compensation impracticable, the director may:

An employer who fails to allow adequate inspection of records in an investigation by the department under this chapter within a reasonable time period may not use such records in any appeal under this section to challenge the correctness of any determination by the department of wages owed or penalty assessed.

## Section 17
1. An employee who has filed a complaint or otherwise initiated an investigation with the department may elect to terminate the department's administrative action, thereby preserving any private right of action, by providing written notice to the department within 10 business days after the employee's receipt of the department's citation and notice of assessment.

2. If the employee elects to terminate the department's administrative action: (a) The department shall immediately discontinue its action against the employer; (b) the department shall vacate a citation and notice of assessment already issued by the department to the employer; and (c) the citation and notice of assessment, and any related findings of fact or conclusions of law by the department, and any payment or offer of payment by the employer of the unpaid compensation, including interest, assessed by the department in the citation and notice of assessment, is not admissible in any court action or other judicial or administrative proceeding.

3. Nothing in this section may be construed to limit or affect: (a) The right of any employee to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to an employer; (b) the right of the department to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to an employee that is identified as a result of a complaint or investigation; or (c) the right of the department to pursue any judicial, administrative, or other action available with respect to an employer in the absence of a complaint. For purposes of this subsection, "employee" means an employee other than an employee who has filed a complaint with the department and who thereafter has elected to terminate the department's administrative action as provided in subsection (1) of this section.

## Section 18
If a respondent fails to comply within 30 days of service of any settlement agreement with the department, or with any final order issued by the director or the administrative law judge for which all appeal rights have been exhausted, the department may pursue, but is not limited to, the following measures to secure compliance:

1. The director may require the respondent to post or distribute public notice of the respondent's failure to comply in a form and manner determined by the department; and

2. The director may request that the liquor and cannabis board or department of revenue deny, suspend, refuse to renew, or revoke any cannabis business license held or requested by the employer or person until such time as the employer complies with the remedy as defined in the settlement agreement or final order. The liquor and cannabis board and the department of revenue are authorized to deny, refuse to renew, or revoke any cannabis business license in accordance with this subsection.

## Section 19
1. A respondent that is the subject of a settlement agreement or final order issued under this chapter may not quit business, sell out, exchange, convey, or otherwise dispose of the respondent's business or stock of goods without first notifying the department and without first notifying the respondent's successor of the amounts owed under the settlement agreement or final order at least three business days prior to such transaction.

2. At the time the respondent quits business, or sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the respondent's business or stock of goods, the full amount of the remedy, as defined in the settlement agreement or the final order issued by the director or the administrative law judge, will be immediately due and payable.

3. [Empty]

    a. If the amount due under the settlement agreement or final order is not paid by the respondent within 10 days from the date of the sale, exchange, conveyance, or disposal, the successor becomes liable for the payment of the amount due, provided that the successor has actual knowledge of the order and the amounts due or has prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the order and the amounts due.

    b. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay the amount of the full remedy. When the successor makes such payment, that payment is considered a payment upon the purchase price in the amount paid, and if the payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference becomes a debt owed to the successor by the employer.

## Section 20
1. Any person or class of persons that suffers an injury as a result of a violation of this chapter or is the subject of prohibited retaliation under section 9 of this act may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the employer or other person violating this chapter. Upon prevailing, the plaintiff may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs and legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the violation including, without limitation: The payment of any unpaid compensation plus interest due to the person and liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid compensation; and a penalty payable to any aggrieved party of up to $5,755.31 if the aggrieved party was subject to prohibited retaliation. Interest will accrue from the date the unpaid compensation was first due at 12 percent per annum, or the maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020.

2. For purposes of this section, "person" includes any entity a member of which has suffered an injury or retaliation, or any other individual or entity acting on behalf of an aggrieved party that has suffered injury or retaliation.

3. [Empty]

    a. For purposes of determining membership within a class of persons entitled to bring an action under this section, two or more employees are similarly situated if they:

        i. Are or were employed by the same employer or employers, whether concurrently or otherwise, at some point during the applicable statute of limitations period;

        ii. Allege one or more violations that raise similar questions as to liability; and

        iii. Seek similar forms of relief.

    b. For purposes of this subsection, employees are not dissimilar solely because:

        i. The employees' claims seek damages that differ in amount; or

        ii. The job titles or other means of classifying employees differ in ways that are unrelated to their claims.

4. An order issued by the court may include a requirement for an employer to submit a compliance report to the court and to the department.

## Section 21
Any waiver by an individual of any provisions of this chapter is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable.

## Section 22
1. The provisions of this chapter:

    a. Supplement and do not diminish or replace any other basis of liability or requirement established by statute or common law;

    b. Do not preempt, limit, or otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, local ordinance, regulation, requirement, policy, or standard for minimum labor and compensation requirements, or which extends other protections to employees of a cannabis business; and

    c. Must not be interpreted or applied to create any power or duty in conflict with federal or state law.

2. This chapter does not preclude any person aggrieved from seeking judicial review of any final administrative decision or order made under this chapter affecting such person. Nothing in this section restricts an employee's right to pursue any other remedies at law or equity for violation of the employee's rights.

## Section 23
This act may be known and cited as the cannabis employee job retention act.
