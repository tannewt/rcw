<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The legislature recognizes that many school districts do not receive adequate funding for student transportation under the student transportation allocation reporting system formula. The legislature finds that the student transportation allocation reporting system formula does not provide sufficient transportation for special student populations and skill center students and does not adequately fund modern education services. The legislature recognizes that the current student transportation allocation reporting system formula does not provide sufficient funding to address unique transportation challenges faced by rural and high population density urban school districts. Therefore, the legislature intends to continue to gather additional data and implement a new student transportation formula to address each of these shortcomings in the existing student transportation formula. It is the intent of the legislature to keep all school district transportation allocations wholly funded while the new student transportation formula is developed. Data collected by the superintendent of public instruction will be used to fully develop a new student transportation formula in subsequent biennia.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>By June 1, 2027, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must provide an analysis of school district transportation costs and allocations following the 2025-26 school year to the education and fiscal committees of the legislature. This analysis must include the mileage, ridership, and costs for each district, disaggregated by the following student demographic categories: (1) Students requiring special transportation services to access special education services that are documented in a properly formed and approved individualized education program; (2) students requiring special transportation due to requirements of the McKinney-Vento homeless assistance act or other federal program; (3) students requiring special transportation due to a foster care placement out of their regular school district boundary; (4) students attending skill centers; and (5) all other students transported to and from school. The legislature intends to use this data to inform their future discussions on revising the overall student transportation allocation model to a more transparent and predictable funding model.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>Funds allocated for transportation costs, except for funds provided for transportation and transportation services to and from school shall be in addition to the basic education allocation. The distribution formula developed in RCW 28A.160.150 through 28A.160.180 shall be for allocation purposes only and shall not be construed as mandating specific levels of pupil transportation services by local districts. Operating costs as determined under RCW 28A.160.150 through 28A.160.180 shall be funded at one hundred percent or as close thereto as reasonably possible for transportation of an eligible student to and from school as defined in RCW 28A.160.160(4). In addition, funding shall be provided for transportation services for students living within the walk area as determined under RCW 28A.160.160(6).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Students attending skill centers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Eligible student&quot; means any student served by the transportation program of a school district or compensated for individual transportation arrangements authorized by RCW 28A.160.030 whose route stop is outside the walk area for a student's school, except if the student to be transported is disabled under RCW 28A.155.020 and is either not ambulatory or not capable of protecting his or her own welfare while traveling to or from the school or agency where special education services are provided, in which case no mileage distance restriction applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Superintendent&quot; means the superintendent of public instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;To and from school&quot; means the transportation of students, including those students listed in the distinct passenger categories as defined in this section, for the following purposes:</p>

Transportation for field trips may not be considered part of transportation of students &quot;to and from school&quot; under this section.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>&quot;Transportation services&quot; for students living within the walk area includes the coordination of walk-to-school programs, the funding of crossing guards, and matching funds for local and state transportation projects intended to mitigate hazardous walking conditions. Priority for transportation services shall be given to students in grades kindergarten through five.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;walk area&quot; means that area around a school with an adequate roadway configuration to provide students access to school with a walking distance of less than one mile. Mileage must be measured along the shortest roadway or maintained public walkway where hazardous conditions do not exist. The hazardous conditions must be documented by a process established in rule by the superintendent of public instruction and must include roadway, environmental, and social conditions. Each elementary school shall identify walk routes within the walk area.</p>
