<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that cancer continues to be the leading cause of death in Washington. The legislature further finds that dedicated funding for cancer research is essential for the development of lifesaving innovations that detect, treat, and prevent cancer. The legislature recognizes that October was the first month popularly designated as a cancer awareness month, thanks to efforts begun by the American cancer society nearly 40 years ago to combat breast cancer. The legislature further acknowledges the need to provide ample funding for cancer research and is committed to promoting healthier lives for the people of this state. In furtherance of this acknowledgment, the legislature intends to dedicate a portion of state sales taxes collected in the month of October to the Andy Hill cancer research endowment fund.</p>
