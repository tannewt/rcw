<p>(B) Whose non-United States group-wide supervisor that is not in a reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the commissioner in rule, the group capital calculation as the worldwide group capital assessment for United States insurance groups who operate in that jurisdiction.</p>
<pre><code>b. Notwithstanding the provisions of (a)(iii) and (iv) of this subsection, the lead state commissioner shall require the group capital calculation for United States operations of any non-United States based insurance holding company system where, after any necessary consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance marketplace.

c. Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital calculation stated in (a) of this subsection, the lead state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria as specified by the commissioner in regulation.

d. If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this section, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.

Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are considered scoped into the national association of insurance commissioners liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year unless the lead state commissioner, in consultation with the national association of insurance commissioners financial stability task force or its successor, determines the insurer should not be scoped into the framework for that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the national association of insurance commissioners liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state commissioner, in consultation with the national association of insurance commissioners financial stability task force or its successor, determines the insurer should be scoped into the framework for that data year.</p>

<li>
<p>The performance of, and filing of the results from, a specific year's liquidity stress test shall comply with the national association of insurance commissioners liquidity stress test framework's instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead state commissioner determinations, in consultation with the financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the framework.</p>
