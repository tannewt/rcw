[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6031.pdf)

## Section 1
Funds allocated for transportation costs, except for funds provided for transportation and transportation services to and from school shall be in addition to the basic education allocation. The distribution formula developed in RCW 28A.160.150 through 28A.160.180 shall be for allocation purposes only and shall not be construed as mandating specific levels of pupil transportation services by local districts nor the type of vehicle to be used for pupil transportation. School districts are encouraged to use the vehicle type deemed by a district to be the safest and most cost-effective manner of transporting its students, including using school buses and vans, and may use the student transportation allocation accordingly. Operating costs as determined under RCW 28A.160.150 through 28A.160.180 shall be funded at 100 percent or as close thereto as reasonably possible for transportation of an eligible student to and from school as defined in RCW 28A.160.160(3). In addition, funding shall be provided for transportation services for students living within the walk area as determined under RCW 28A.160.160(5).

## Section 2
Each district shall submit three times each year to the superintendent of public instruction during October, February, and May of each year a report containing the following:

1. [Empty]

    a. The number of eligible students transported to and from school as provided for in RCW 28A.160.150, along with identification of stop locations and school locations, and (b) the number of miles driven per vehicle type for pupil transportation services as authorized in RCW 28A.160.150 the previous school year; and

2. Other operational data and descriptions as required by the superintendent to determine allocation requirements for each district. The superintendent shall require that districts separate the costs of operating the program for the transportation of eligible students to and from school as defined by RCW 28A.160.160(3), non-to-and-from-school pupil transportation costs, and costs to provide expanded services under RCW 28A.160.185(1) in the annual financial statement. The cost, quantity, and type of all fuel purchased by school districts for use in to-and-from-school transportation shall be included in the annual financial statement.

Each district shall submit the information required in this section on a timely basis as a condition of the continuing receipt of school transportation moneys.

## Section 3
Each district's annual student transportation allocation shall be determined by the superintendent of public instruction in the following manner:

1. The superintendent shall annually calculate the transportation allocation for those services provided for in RCW 28A.160.150, inclusive of all vehicle types used. The allocation formula may be adjusted to include such additional differential factors as basic and special passenger counts as defined by the superintendent of public instruction, average distance to school, and number of locations served.

2. The allocation shall be based on a regression analysis of the number of basic and special students transported and as many other site characteristics that are identified as being statistically significant.

3. The transportation allocation for transporting students in district-owned passenger cars, as defined in RCW 46.04.382, pursuant to RCW 28A.160.010 for services provided for in RCW 28A.160.150 if a school district deems it advisable to use such vehicles after the school district board of directors has considered the safety of the students being transported as well as the economy of utilizing a district-owned passenger car in lieu of a school bus must be included in the overall determination of the district's annual student transportation allocation. Students transported in district-owned passenger cars must be included in the corresponding basic or special passenger counts, average distance to school, and number of locations served.

4. Prior to June 1st of each year the superintendent shall submit to the office of financial management, and the education and fiscal committees of the legislature, a report outlining the methodology and rationale used in determining the statistical coefficients for each site characteristic used to determine the allocation for the following year.
