<p>By complying with this chapter:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>One or more domestic corporations may merge with one or more domestic corporations or other entities in accordance with a plan of merger, resulting in a surviving entity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two or more other entities may merge, resulting in a surviving entity that is a domestic corporation created by the merger.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>By complying with the provisions of this chapter applicable to other entities, an other entity may be a party to a merger with a domestic corporation or may be created as the surviving entity in a merger in which a domestic corporation is a party, but only if the merger is permitted by the organic law of the other entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the organic law or organic rules of a domestic other entity do not provide procedures for the approval of a merger, a plan of merger may nonetheless be approved by the unanimous consent of all of the interest holders of that other entity, and the merger may thereafter be effected as provided in the other provisions of this chapter. For the purposes of applying this chapter in such a case:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The other entity, its interest holders, interests, and organic rules taken together will be deemed to be a domestic corporation, shareholders, shares, and articles of incorporation, respectively, and vice versa as the context may require; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The articles of incorporation of any domestic corporation, or the public organic record of any other entity, to be created by the merger pursuant to subsection (1)(b) or (2) of this section; and</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the requirements of subsection (4) of this section, a plan of merger may contain amendments to the articles of incorporation or public organic record of any party to the merger that will be the surviving entity, a restatement that includes one or more amendments to the surviving entity's articles of incorporation or public organic record, and any other provision not prohibited by law.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The articles of incorporation of any domestic corporation, or the organic rules of any other entity, that will be the surviving entity of the merger, unless (A) the change constitutes an amendment to the articles of incorporation or organic rules of the surviving entity that would be permitted without approval of shareholders or interest holders by RCW 23B.10.020 or by comparable provisions of the organic law of any such other entity, or (B) the shareholders or interest holders that were entitled to vote on or consent to approval of the plan of merger will not continue as or become shareholders or interest holders of the surviving entity; or</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the case of a domestic corporation that is a party to a merger or the acquired entity in a share exchange, the plan of merger or share exchange must be approved in the following manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The plan of merger or share exchange must first be approved by the board of directors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, and in sections 6, 7, and 11 of this act, the plan of merger or share exchange must then be approved by the shareholders. In submitting the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders for approval, the board of directors must recommend that the shareholders approve the plan or, in the case of an offer referred to in section 6(1)(b) of this act, that the shareholders tender their shares to the offeror in response to the offer, unless (a) the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, or (b) RCW 23B.08.245 applies. If either (a) or (b) of this subsection applies, the board of directors must inform the shareholders of the basis for so proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board of directors may set conditions for the approval of the plan of merger or share exchange by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved by the shareholders, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation must notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy of the plan or a summary of the material terms and conditions of the proposed merger or share exchange and the consideration to be received by shareholders. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing domestic corporation or other entity, the notice must also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of that domestic corporation or the organic rules of that other entity. If the corporation is to be merged with a domestic corporation or other entity and a new domestic corporation or other entity is to be created as a result of the merger, the notice must include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the new domestic corporation or the organic rules of the new other entity.</p>

<li>
<p>With respect to a domestic corporation formed before August 1, 2024:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, require a different vote, shareholder approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires (A) the approval of two-thirds of the voting group comprising all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan, and (B) the approval of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by each other voting group entitled under section 5 of this act or the articles of incorporation to vote separately on the plan; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The articles of incorporation may require a different vote than that provided in this subsection, or a different vote by separate voting groups, so long as the required vote is not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan and of each other voting group entitled to vote separately on the plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>With respect to a domestic corporation formed on or after August 1, 2024, unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, require a greater vote, shareholder approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires (i) the approval of a majority of the voting group comprising all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan, and (ii) the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by each other voting group entitled under section 5 of this act or the articles of incorporation to vote separately on the plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, approval of a plan of merger by the shareholders of a domestic corporation that is a party to the merger is not required if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Such corporation will survive the merger;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for amendments permitted by RCW 23B.10.020, its articles of incorporation will not be changed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each shareholder of such corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the merger becomes effective will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences, rights, and limitations, immediately after the merger becomes effective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If as a result of a merger or share exchange one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to new owner liability, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires the express written consent of each such shareholder to become subject to that new owner liability in connection with the merger or share exchange, unless in the case of a shareholder that already has owner liability with respect to that domestic corporation, (a) the new owner liability is with respect to a domestic corporation (which may be a different or the same domestic corporation in which the person is a shareholder) or other entity, and (b) the terms and conditions of the new owner liability are substantially identical to those of the existing owner liability (other than for changes that eliminate or reduce that owner liability).</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to subsection (2) of this section, separate voting by voting groups is required:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>On a plan of merger, by each class or series of shares of a domestic corporation that is a party to the merger that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Is to be converted under the plan into shares, other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, or is to be canceled under the plan; or</p>

<li>
<p>Is entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision in the plan that constitutes a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation of such corporation that requires action by separate voting groups under RCW 23B.10.040 if such corporation is the surviving entity in the merger and the holders of such class or series will continue as shareholders of the surviving entity;</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>On a plan of share exchange, by each class or series of shares of a domestic corporation included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a plan of merger or share exchange, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a separate voting group on the plan of merger or share exchange, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The articles of incorporation may expressly limit or eliminate the separate voting rights provided in subsection (1)(a)(i) and (b) of this section as to any class or series of shares. A provision in the articles of incorporation of a domestic corporation formed before August 1, 2024, limiting or eliminating the separate voting rights provided under RCW 23B.11.035 in effect prior to the effective date of this section will be deemed to limit or eliminate the separate voting rights provided in subsection (1)(a)(i) and (b) of this section to the same extent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a proposed plan of merger or share exchange that entitles the holders of two or more classes or series of shares to vote as separate voting groups under this section would affect those two or more classes or series in the same or a substantially similar way, then instead of voting as separate voting groups, the holders of shares of the classes or series so affected are to vote together as a single voting group on the proposed plan of merger or share exchange, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or by the board of directors in accordance with section 4(3) of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holders of shares of two or more classes or series of shares of a domestic corporation that is a party to the merger or the acquired entity in a share exchange who would, under a proposed plan, receive the same type of consideration in the form of shares or other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests of the surviving or acquiring entity or of any parent entity of the surviving entity, cash or other form of consideration, or the same combination thereof, but in differing amounts resulting solely from application of provisions in the corporation's articles of incorporation governing distribution of consideration received in a merger or share exchange, are deemed to be affected in the same or a substantially similar way and are not, by reason of receiving the same types or differing amounts of consideration, entitled to vote as separate voting groups on the proposed plan, unless the articles of incorporation of such corporation expressly require otherwise or the board of directors conditions its submission of the proposed plan on a separate vote by one or more classes or series.</p>

<li>
<p>The holding company and the constituent corporations to the merger are each organized under this title;</p>

<li>
<p>At all times from its incorporation until consummation of a merger under this section, the holding company was a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the parent constituent corporation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immediately before consummation of a merger under this section, the subsidiary constituent corporation is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the parent constituent corporation;</p>

<li>
<p>The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the holding company immediately after the merger becomes effective contain provisions identical to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the parent constituent corporation immediately before the merger becomes effective, other than any provisions regarding the incorporator or incorporators, the corporate name, the registered office and agent, the initial board of directors and the initial subscribers for shares, and the provisions contained in any amendment to the articles of incorporation of the parent constituent corporation that were necessary to effect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of shares if the exchange, reclassification, or cancellation has become effective;</p>

<li>The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger becomes effective contain provisions by specific reference to this subsection requiring that any corporate action by or involving the surviving corporation, other than the election or removal of directors of the surviving corporation, must be approved by the shareholders of the holding company (or any successor by merger) by the same vote as is required by this title or under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the parent constituent corporation immediately before the merger becomes effective, if that corporate action would have required the approval of the shareholders of the parent constituent corporation under this title or under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the parent constituent corporation immediately before the merger becomes effective;</li>

<li>
<p>To the extent restrictions under chapter 23B.19 RCW applied to the parent constituent corporation or any of its shareholders at the effective time of the merger, those restrictions apply to the holding company and its shareholders immediately after the merger becomes effective as though the holding company were the parent constituent corporation, and all shares of stock of the holding company acquired in the merger will, for the purposes of chapter 23B.19 RCW, be deemed to have been acquired at the time that the corresponding shares of stock of the parent constituent corporation were acquired. No shareholder who, immediately before the merger becomes effective, was not an acquiring person of the parent constituent corporation under chapter 23B.19 RCW will, solely by reason of the merger, become an acquiring person of the holding company under chapter 23B.19 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>To the extent a shareholder of the parent constituent corporation immediately before the merger was eligible to commence a proceeding in the right of the parent constituent corporation in accordance with RCW 23B.07.400, nothing in this section is deemed to limit or extinguish that eligibility.</p>
