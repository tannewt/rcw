## Section 1
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Acquired entity" means the domestic corporation that will have all of one or more classes or series of its shares acquired in a share exchange.

2. "Acquiring entity" means the domestic corporation that will acquire all of one or more classes or series of shares of the acquired entity in a share exchange.

3. "New owner liability" means owner liability of a person, resulting from a merger or share exchange, that is (a) in respect of an entity which is different from the entity in which the person held shares or interests immediately before the merger or share exchange became effective; or (b) in respect of the same entity as the one in which the person held shares or interests immediately before the merger or share exchange became effective if (i) the person did not have owner liability immediately before the merger or share exchange became effective, or (ii) the person had owner liability immediately before the merger or share exchange became effective, the terms and conditions of which were changed when the merger or share exchange became effective.

4. "Party to a merger" means any domestic corporation or other entity that will merge under a plan of merger.

5. "Surviving entity" in a merger means the domestic corporation or other entity into which one or more other domestic corporations or other entities are merged.

## Section 2
1. By complying with this chapter, one or more domestic corporations may merge with one or more domestic corporations or other entities in accordance with a plan of merger, resulting in a surviving entity.

2. By complying with the provisions of this chapter applicable to other entities, an other entity may be a party to a merger with a domestic corporation, but only if the merger is permitted by the organic law of the other entity.

3. If the organic law or organic rules of a domestic other entity do not provide procedures for the approval of a merger, a plan of merger may nonetheless be approved by the unanimous consent of all of the interest holders of that other entity, and the merger may thereafter be effected as provided in the other provisions of this chapter. For the purposes of applying this chapter in such a case:

    a. The other entity, its interest holders, interests, and organic rules taken together will be deemed to be a domestic corporation, shareholders, shares, and articles of incorporation, respectively, and vice versa as the context may require; and

    b. If the business and affairs of the other entity are managed by a person or persons that are not identical to the interest holders, that group will be deemed to be the board of directors.

4. The plan of merger must include:

    a. As to each party to the merger, its name, jurisdiction of organization, and type of entity;

    b. The surviving entity's name, jurisdiction of organization, and type of entity;

    c. The manner and basis of converting the shares of each merging domestic corporation and interests of each merging other entity into shares or other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests, cash, or other property, or of canceling some or all of such shares or interests, or any combination of the foregoing; and

    d. Any other provisions required by the laws under which any party to the merger is organized or by which it is governed, or by the articles of incorporation or organic rules of any such party.

5. In addition to the requirements of subsection (4) of this section, a plan of merger may contain amendments to the articles of incorporation or public organic record of any party to the merger that will be the surviving entity, a restatement that includes one or more amendments to the surviving entity's articles of incorporation or public organic record, and any other provision not prohibited by law.

6. Terms of a plan of merger may be made dependent on facts objectively ascertainable outside the plan in accordance with RCW 23B.01.200(3).

7. A plan of merger may be amended only with the consent of each party to the merger, except as provided in the plan of merger. An amendment to a plan of merger that has previously been approved by a party's shareholders or interest holders must be approved:

    a. In the same manner as the plan was approved, if the plan of merger does not provide for the manner in which it may be amended; or

    b. In the manner provided in the plan of merger, except that shareholders or interest holders that were entitled to vote on or consent to approval of the plan of merger are entitled to vote on or consent to any amendment of the plan of merger that will change:

        i. The amount or kind of shares or other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests, cash, or other property to be received under the plan of merger by the shareholders or interest holders of any party to the merger;

        ii. The articles of incorporation of any domestic corporation, or the organic rules of any other entity, that will be the surviving entity of the merger, unless (A) the change constitutes an amendment to the articles of incorporation or organic rules of the surviving entity that would be permitted without approval of shareholders or interest holders by RCW 23B.10.020 or by comparable provisions of the organic law of any such other entity, or (B) the shareholders or interest holders that were entitled to vote on or consent to approval of the plan of merger will not continue as or become shareholders or interest holders of the surviving entity; or

        iii. Any of the other terms or conditions of the plan of merger if the change would adversely affect such shareholders or interest holders in any material respect.

## Section 3
1. By complying with this chapter:

    a. A domestic corporation may acquire all of the shares of one or more classes or series of shares of another domestic corporation in exchange for shares or other securities, obligations, rights to acquire shares or other securities, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, pursuant to a plan of share exchange; or

    b. All of the shares of one or more classes or series of shares of a domestic corporation may be acquired by another domestic corporation in exchange for shares or other securities, obligations, rights to acquire shares or other securities, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, pursuant to a plan of share exchange.

## Section 4
In the case of a domestic corporation that is a party to a merger or the acquired entity in a share exchange, the plan of merger or share exchange must be approved in the following manner:

1. The plan of merger or share exchange must first be approved by the board of directors.

2. Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, and in sections 6, 7, and 11 of this act, the plan of merger or share exchange must then be approved by the shareholders. In submitting the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders for approval, the board of directors must recommend that the shareholders approve the plan or, in the case of an offer referred to in section 6(1)(b) of this act, that the shareholders tender their shares to the offeror in response to the offer, unless (a) the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, or (b) RCW 23B.08.245 applies. If either (a) or (b) of this subsection applies, the board of directors must inform the shareholders of the basis for so proceeding.

3. The board of directors may set conditions for the approval of the plan of merger or share exchange by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the plan.

4. If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved by the shareholders, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation must notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy of the plan or a summary of the material terms and conditions of the proposed merger or share exchange and the consideration to be received by shareholders. If the corporation is to be merged into a domestic corporation or other entity, the notice must also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of that domestic corporation or the organic rules of that other entity.

5. [Empty]

    a. With respect to a domestic corporation formed before August 1, 2024:

        i. Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, require a different vote, shareholder approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires (A) the approval of two-thirds of the voting group comprising all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan, and (B) the approval of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by each other voting group entitled under section 5 of this act or the articles of incorporation to vote separately on the plan; and

        ii. The articles of incorporation may require a different vote than that provided in this subsection, or a different vote by separate voting groups, so long as the required vote is not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan and of each other voting group entitled to vote separately on the plan.

    b. With respect to a domestic corporation formed on or after August 1, 2024, unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, require a greater vote, shareholder approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires (i) the approval of a majority of the voting group comprising all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan, and (ii) the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by each other voting group entitled under section 5 of this act or the articles of incorporation to vote separately on the plan.

6. Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, approval of a plan of merger by the shareholders of a domestic corporation that is a party to the merger is not required if:

    a. Such corporation will survive the merger;

    b. Except for amendments permitted by RCW 23B.10.020, its articles of incorporation will not be changed; and

    c. Each shareholder of such corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the merger becomes effective will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences, rights, and limitations, immediately after the merger becomes effective.

7. If as a result of a merger or share exchange one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to new owner liability, approval of the plan of merger or share exchange requires the express written consent of each such shareholder to become subject to that new owner liability in connection with the merger or share exchange, unless in the case of a shareholder that already has owner liability with respect to that domestic corporation, (a) the new owner liability is with respect to a domestic corporation (which may be a different or the same domestic corporation in which the person is a shareholder) or other entity, and (b) the terms and conditions of the new owner liability are substantially identical to those of the existing owner liability (other than for changes that eliminate or reduce that owner liability).

## Section 5
1. Subject to subsection (2) of this section, separate voting by voting groups is required:

    a. On a plan of merger, by each class or series of shares of a domestic corporation that is a party to the merger that:

        i. Is to be converted under the plan into shares, other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, or is to be canceled under the plan; or

        ii. Is entitled to vote as a separate group on a provision in the plan that constitutes a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation of such corporation that requires action by separate voting groups under RCW 23B.10.040 if such corporation is the surviving entity in the merger and the holders of such class or series will continue as shareholders of the surviving entity;

    b. On a plan of share exchange, by each class or series of shares of a domestic corporation included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group; and

    c. On a plan of merger or share exchange, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a separate voting group on the plan of merger or share exchange, respectively.

2. The articles of incorporation may expressly limit or eliminate the separate voting rights provided in subsection (1)(a)(i) and (b) of this section as to any class or series of shares. A provision in the articles of incorporation of a domestic corporation formed before August 1, 2024, limiting or eliminating the separate voting rights provided under RCW 23B.11.035 in effect prior to the effective date of this section will be deemed to limit or eliminate the separate voting rights provided in subsection (1)(a)(i) and (b) of this section to the same extent.

3. If a proposed plan of merger or share exchange that entitles the holders of two or more classes or series of shares to vote as separate voting groups under this section would affect those two or more classes or series in the same or a substantially similar way, then instead of voting as separate voting groups, the holders of shares of the classes or series so affected are to vote together as a single voting group on the proposed plan of merger or share exchange, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or by the board of directors in accordance with section 4(3) of this act.

4. Holders of shares of two or more classes or series of shares of a domestic corporation that is a party to the merger or the acquired entity in a share exchange who would, under a proposed plan, receive the same type of consideration in the form of shares or other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities or interests of the surviving or acquiring entity or of any parent entity of the surviving entity, cash or other form of consideration, or the same combination thereof, but in differing amounts resulting solely from application of provisions in the corporation's articles of incorporation governing distribution of consideration received in a merger or share exchange, are deemed to be affected in the same or a substantially similar way and are not, by reason of receiving the same types or differing amounts of consideration, entitled to vote as separate voting groups on the proposed plan, unless the articles of incorporation of such corporation expressly require otherwise or the board of directors conditions its submission of the proposed plan on a separate vote by one or more classes or series.

    c. The offer discloses that the plan of merger or share exchange provides that the merger or share exchange will be effected as soon as practicable following the satisfaction of the requirements of (f) of this subsection and that the shares of the corporation that are not tendered in response to the offer will be treated as provided in (h) of this subsection;

    g. The offeror or a wholly owned subsidiary of the offeror merges with or into, or effects a share exchange in which it acquires shares of, the corporation; and

    h. Each outstanding share of each class or series of shares of the corporation that the offeror is offering to purchase in accordance with the offer, and which is not purchased in accordance with the offer, is to be converted in the merger into, or into the right to receive, or is to be exchanged in the share exchange for, or for the right to receive, the same amount and kind of securities, interests, obligations, rights, cash, or other property to be paid or exchanged in accordance with the offer for each share of that class or series of shares that is tendered in response to the offer, except that shares of the corporation that are owned by the corporation or that are described in (f)(ii) or (iii) of this subsection need not be converted into or exchanged for the consideration described in this subsection.

Either: (A) In the case of shares represented by certificates, the offeror, or the offeror's designated depository or other agent, has physically received the certificates representing those shares; or (B) in the case of shares without certificates, those shares have been transferred into the account of the offeror or its designated depository or other agent, or an agent's message relating to those shares has been received by the offeror or its designated depository or other agent.

    e. "Wholly owned subsidiary" of a person means an entity of or in which that person owns, directly or indirectly, through one or more wholly owned subsidiaries, all of the outstanding shares or interests.

    f. Immediately after the merger becomes effective, the surviving corporation of the merger becomes or remains a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the holding company;

    g. Each share or fraction of a share of the parent constituent corporation outstanding immediately before the merger becomes effective is converted in the merger into a share or equal fraction of a share of the holding company having the same designations and relative preferences, rights, and limitations as the share or fraction of a share of the parent constituent corporation being converted in the merger;

    h. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the holding company immediately after the merger becomes effective contain provisions identical to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the parent constituent corporation immediately before the merger becomes effective, other than any provisions regarding the incorporator or incorporators, the corporate name, the registered office and agent, the initial board of directors and the initial subscribers for shares, and the provisions contained in any amendment to the articles of incorporation of the parent constituent corporation that were necessary to effect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of shares if the exchange, reclassification, or cancellation has become effective;

        i. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger becomes effective contain provisions by specific reference to this subsection requiring that any corporate action by or involving the surviving corporation, other than the election or removal of directors of the surviving corporation, must be approved by the shareholders of the holding company (or any successor by merger) by the same vote as is required by this title or under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the parent constituent corporation immediately before the merger becomes effective, if that corporate action would have required the approval of the shareholders of the parent constituent corporation under this title or under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the parent constituent corporation immediately before the merger becomes effective;

6. If as a result of the conversion one or more shareholders of the converting entity would become subject to owner liability, approval of the plan of entity conversion must also require each such shareholder to execute a separate written consent to become subject to such owner liability.
