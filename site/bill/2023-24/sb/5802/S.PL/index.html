<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that staff and resources needed to adequately care for individuals with cognitive or behavioral impairments is not limited to support for activities of daily living. Therefore, the department shall:</p>
<p>a.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2024, implement a method for applying case mix to the rate. This method should be informed by the minimum data set collected by the centers for medicare and medicaid services;</p>
<pre><code>b. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, employ the case mix adjustment method to adjust rates of individual facilities for case mix changes;

c. Upon the discontinuation of resource utilization group's scores, and in collaboration with appropriate stakeholders, create a new case mix adjustment method for adjusting direct care rates based on changes in case mix using the patient-driven payment method;

d. By December 1, 2024, provide an initial report to the governor and appropriate legislative committees outlining a phased implementation plan; and

e. By December 1, 2026, provide a final report to the appropriate legislative committees. These reports must include the following information:

    i. An analysis of the potential impact of the new case mix classification methodology on nursing facility payment rates;

    ii. Proposed payment adjustments for capturing specific client needs that may not be clearly captured in the data available from the centers for medicare and medicaid services; and

    iii. A plan to continuously monitor the effects of the new methodologies on each facility to ensure certain client populations or needs are not unintentionally negatively impacted.

<p>2.</p>
<p>A default case mix group shall be established for cases in which the resident dies or is discharged for any purpose prior to completion of the resident's initial assessment. The default case mix group and case mix weight for these cases shall be designated by the department.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>A default case mix group may also be established for cases in which there is an untimely assessment for the resident. The default case mix group and case mix weight for these cases shall be designated by the department.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Each case mix classification group shall be assigned a case mix weight. The case mix weight for each resident of a nursing facility for each calendar quarter or six-month period during a calendar year shall be based on data from resident assessment instruments completed for the resident and weighted by the number of days the resident was in each case mix classification group. Days shall be counted as provided in this section.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The case mix weights shall be based on finalized case mix weights as published by the centers for medicare and medicaid services in the federal register.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From individual case mix weights for the applicable quarter, the department shall determine two average case mix indexes for each medicaid nursing facility, one for all residents in the facility, known as the facility average case mix index, and one for medicaid residents, known as the medicaid average case mix index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In calculating a facility's two average case mix indexes for each quarter, the department shall include all residents or medicaid residents, as applicable, who were physically in the facility during the quarter in question based on the resident assessment instrument completed by the facility and the requirements and limitations for the instrument's completion and transmission (January 1st through March 31st, April 1st through June 30th, July 1st through September 30th, or October 1st through December 31st).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The facility average case mix index shall exclude all default cases as defined in this chapter. However, the medicaid average case mix index shall include all default cases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both the facility average and the medicaid average case mix indexes shall be determined by multiplying the case mix weight of each resident, or each medicaid resident, as applicable, by the number of days, as defined in this section and as applicable, the resident was at each particular case mix classification or group, and then averaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the number of days a resident is classified into a particular case mix group, the department shall determine a start date for calculating case mix grouping periods as specified by rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cut-off date for the department to use resident assessment data, for the purposes of calculating both the facility average and the medicaid average case mix indexes, and for establishing and updating a facility's direct care component rate, shall be one month and one day after the end of the quarter for which the resident assessment data applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the facility average and the medicaid average case mix indexes shall both be calculated quarterly, the cost-rebasing period facility average case mix index will be used throughout the applicable cost-rebasing period in combination with cost report data as specified by RCW 74.46.561, to establish a facility's allowable cost per case mix unit. A facility's medicaid average case mix index shall be used to update a nursing facility's direct care component rate semiannually.</p>
