# SB 5900 - Concerning construction crane safety.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5900.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature finds that there is significant opportunity to improve worker and public safety in tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration. The Seattle tower crane incident on April 27, 2019, killing two members of the public, Sarah Pantip Wong and Alan Jay Justad, and two iron workers, Travis Daniel Corbet and Andrew W. Yoder, exposed weaknesses in construction safety efforts. Requirements for permitting, street closures, and penalties are created to ensure that assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of tower cranes proceed safely.

## Section 2
Sections 3 through 9 of this act apply to construction crane safety.

## Section 3

In adopting rules implementing this requirement, the department may consider similar standards and practices used by the federal government;

    d. Tower cranes and tower crane assembly parts must be inspected by a certified crane inspector  prior to and following every assembly , disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane. Any issues identified throughout the procedure must be logged with a mitigation plan. If the crane inspector is unable to certify, the procedure may not commence;

3. Except as provided in RCW 49.17.410(2), any crane operated in the state must have a valid temporary or final certificate of operation issued by the certified crane inspector or department posted in the operator's cab or station.

4. Certificates of operation issued by the department under the crane certification program established in this section are valid for one year from the effective date of the temporary operating certificate issued by the certified crane inspector.

5. This section does not apply to maritime cranes regulated by the department.

## Section 7
1. The department of labor and industries shall adopt rules necessary to implement sections 3 through 8 of this act.

2. The department shall adopt rules for tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration including, but not limited to:

    a. A process for determining when the department will be present for the assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane;

    b. Requirements that the prime contractors of construction projects acknowledge all applicable safety orders, crane manufacturer operation instructions and guidelines, and recommended practices prior to the assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane;

    c. Requirements that the prime contractor of the construction project ensure that a qualified safety representative of the distributor or manufacturer will be present during assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane to assure that such procedures are performed in accordance with manufacturer operation instructions and guidelines;

    d. Requiring prime contractors of construction projects to follow crane manufacturer operation instructions and guidelines or alternate plans/instructions approved by a registered professional engineer when assembling, disassembling, and reconfiguring a tower crane;

    e. Requiring the presence of an assembly/disassembly director at every tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration to directly oversee all work performed. The assembly/disassembly director may not serve in any other capacity while directly supervising a tower crane assembly, disassembly, or reconfiguration procedure;

    f. Conducting programmed inspections of workplaces that contain tower cranes;

    g. Establishing requirements for the maximum allowable wind speed for tower crane assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration;

    h. Establishing requirements for a written job plan that addresses the requirements of the manufacturer's manual tailored to the site conditions where the tower crane will be installed, as appropriate for assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of a tower crane;

        i. Establishing requirements that must be met to be considered a competent and qualified assembly/disassembly director;

    j. Establishing effective stop work procedures that ensure the authority of any employee, including employees of contractors, to refuse or delay the performance of a task related to a tower crane that the employee believes could reasonably result in serious physical harm or death. The rules must ensure that employees who exercise stop work authority are protected from intimidation, retaliation, or discrimination; and

    k. Other rules necessary to implement sections 3 through 8 of this act.

3. The department shall set fees in rule to be charged for permits issued under section 4 of this act in an amount sufficient to cover the costs of administering sections 3 through 8 of this act.

## Section 8
Tower crane manufacturers and distributors must make available to the public certain information about each crane in a standard format. The prescribed information, format, and distribution channel must be determined by the department, and must include but not be limited to all relevant manufacturer operation instructions and guidelines for the safe use and maintenance of all tower cranes located in the state of Washington. These materials must be written in the English language with customary grammar and punctuation. A tower crane manufacturer or distributor shall, without exception, provide such materials to any person who requests access to such materials, and no manufacturer or distributor may refuse such request. Information must be provided within a reasonable time frame, as determined by the department.

## Section 9

    a. Align permit issuance for street closures with the definition of assembly/disassembly work zone; and

    b. Require the permit holder to give notice to residents of buildings within the assembly/disassembly work zone.

2. For purposes of this section, "assembly, disassembly, or reconfiguration" and "assembly/disassembly work zone" have the same meanings as those terms are defined in RCW 49.17.400.
