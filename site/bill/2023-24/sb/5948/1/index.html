<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The health care system is a comprehensive and interconnected entity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care costs and spending continue to rise and significantly outgrow inflation and the United States gross domestic product per capita;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the health care cost institute, from 2015 to 2019 the average health care spending per person reached $6,000, an increase of 21 percent. Health care prices accounted for nearly two-thirds of this increase in spending after adjusting for inflation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to a Milbank memorial fund issue brief, mitigating the price impacts of health care provider consolidation, consolidation of health care providers into health systems with market power is a primary driver of high health care prices. Further, the issue brief explains, competition in the health care market exists in three areas: (i) Competition between health care providers for inclusion in health plan networks; (ii) competition between health carriers in health plan enrollment; and (iii) competition between health care providers for in-network patients;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 2020 report to congress on medicare payment policy from the medicare payment advisory commission found &quot;the preponderance of evidence suggests that hospital consolidation leads to higher prices. These findings imply that hospitals seek higher prices from insurers and will get them when they have greater bargaining power.&quot; Further, the report noted that &quot;a recent study found that hospital and insurer concentration both increase premiums in the affordable care act marketplace&quot;; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the Washington state office of the insurance commissioner preliminary report of health care affordability, significant vertical and horizontal consolidation has already occurred in Washington state's health care system. The office of the insurance commissioner report found that of the 101 hospitals in Washington state, 40 are part of the five largest hospital systems and nearly 40 to 50 percent of active physicians in Washington state work at a hospital or clinic. The Washington state office of financial management found that the percentage of hospitals in a hospital system grew to nearly 50 percent in 2017 from 10 percent in 1989.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to prohibit the use of certain contractual provisions often used by providers, hospitals, health systems, and carriers with significant market power.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A provider or health carrier may not directly or indirectly offer, solicit, request, or enter into a provider contract that includes an all-or-nothing clause, antisteering clause, or antitiering clause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any provision in a provider contract that is an all-or-nothing clause, an antisteering clause, or an antitiering clause is void and unenforceable. The remaining provisions in the provider contract remain in effect and are enforceable.</p>

<li>
<p>The attorney general may enforce this section under the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

Providers are prohibited from making any public statement or releasing notices of any potential or planned terminations of agreements with health carriers to any patients or third party until 30 days prior to the termination effective date.</p>
