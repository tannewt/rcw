<ol>
<li>
<p>There is created the Washington national guard member referral incentive program. The purpose of the program is to incentivize and maximize peer-to-peer recruiting that results in a completed accession to the Washington national guard by providing a referral bonus to Washington national guard members who make a successful referral. Administration of this program requires that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A Washington national guard member may provide the identity and contact information of a person who the member believes would be an appropriate recruitment prospect using a form provided by the Washington national guard, which includes the person's name, contact information, and any other information required by the state military department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state military department shall keep a record of all forms submitted under (a) of this subsection. Upon the completed accession of a referred person and to the extent sufficient funds are available, the state military department shall distribute a referral bonus to the member who provided the successful referral.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members of the Washington national guard serving in command or senior enlisted advisor positions, as well as those assigned recruiting as a primary or additional duty, are ineligible for the Washington national guard member referral incentive program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Completed accession&quot; means the referred person signs the referred person's name to an enlistment contract for entry or reentry after prior service into the Washington national guard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Referral bonus&quot; means a monetary payment set each calendar year by the adjutant general not to exceed $500.00;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Successful referral&quot; means providing the identity and contact information in subsection (1)(a) of this section of any person not already a member of the Washington national guard that results in a completed accession to the Washington national guard.</p>
</li>
</ol>
