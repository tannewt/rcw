## Section 1
In any matter brought pursuant to domestic relations proceedings under this chapter:

1. A court must provide translated standard forms to a limited English proficiency party or a deaf, deaf-blind, or hard of hearing party when the party requests translated standard forms, or when the court finds good cause to provide the party translated standard forms. The court must provide translated standard forms pursuant to this subsection at no cost to the party.

2. A court may order sight translation of standard forms to a limited English proficiency party or a deaf, deaf-blind, or hard of hearing party when the court finds good cause to require sight translation of standard forms. The interpreter appointed for this purpose for a person with limited English proficiency must be an interpreter certified or registered by the administrative office of the courts pursuant to chapter 2.43 RCW or a qualified interpreter registered by the administrative office of the courts in a noncertified language, or where the necessary language is not certified or registered, the interpreter must be qualified by the judicial officer pursuant to chapter 2.43 RCW. In the event the party who is deaf, deaf-blind, or hard of hearing relies on any form of a signed language, the interpreter appointed for this purpose must be an interpreter appointed pursuant to chapter 2.42 RCW. An interpreter appointed pursuant to this subsection must be provided at no cost to the party.

3. A court must give special consideration on whether good cause exists to order a sight translation of standard forms pursuant to subsection (2) of this section in matters involving the creation of a permanent parenting plan under RCW 26.09.184.
