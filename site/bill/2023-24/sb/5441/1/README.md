# SB 5441 - School district curricula

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5441.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes public school instruction should include the study of the role and contributions of men, women, indigenous peoples, Black Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, European Americans, LGBTQIA2S+ Americans, persons with disabilities, and members of other ethnic and cultural groups. This study is especially important in the social sciences, which should seek to understand the economic, political, and social development of Washington state and the United States and should emphasize portraying the role of these groups in contemporary society.

2. The legislature believes that an inclusive education helps students of all backgrounds, cultures, and identities connect with the instructional materials and helps all students feel a sense of belonging at school. Further, the legislature has confidence that students who do not share these backgrounds, cultures, and identities get a more complete and well-rounded education of history and society when it is inclusive.

3. The legislature recognizes that inclusive curricula have been shown to often improve the mental health, academic performance, attendance rates, and graduation rates of marginalized communities. For example, a 2017 study showed a 38 percent to 306 percent increase in the fluency rates of African American second grade children when they read culturally relevant stories. Children felt more motivated and interested when reading stories that reflected them. Additionally, students in schools with inclusive curricula have also reported hearing fewer homophobic remarks and in schools with inclusive curricula, less than half of students felt unsafe at school due to their sexual orientation compared to the two-thirds of students who attended schools without inclusive curricula.

4. The legislature intends to promote and support the development and adoption of curricula that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive through inclusive curricula coordinators, youth advisory councils, and an open educational resource database.
