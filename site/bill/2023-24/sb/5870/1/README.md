# SB 5870 - Early learning programs

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5870.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the early childhood education and assistance, birth to three early childhood education and assistance, head start, and early head start programs provide quality early learning and child care services to families across Washington state. The legislature intends to increase access to early education programs for certain families by expanding eligibility and streamlining eligibility for early learning programs.

2. The legislature recognizes that in recent years, early childhood education and assistance, birth to three early childhood education and assistance, head start, and early head start program providers have faced challenges in hiring and retaining staff. Similar to the benefit conferred to other early education staff pursuant to RCW 43.216.1364, the legislature intends to provide program staff with access to working connections child care eligibility to strengthen workforce resiliency and benefits.

3. The legislature further recognizes that these programs provide care for children and also services for the family unit, which require participation and efforts on the part of the family. The legislature finds that current approved activity requirements can hinder program efficacy and child continuity of care. The legislature intends to recognize program participation as an approved activity so families can achieve stability and long-term economic success and well-being.

4. The legislature further recognizes that navigating public benefits systems for early education and child care programs can be difficult for families. The legislature resolves to reduce administrative barriers to eligibility by providing categorical access for families that have already met income eligibility tests for certain other public benefit programs.
