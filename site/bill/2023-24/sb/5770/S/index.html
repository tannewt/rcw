<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the arbitrary one percent limitation on the growth of property tax collections has severely inhibited the ability of counties, cities, and special purpose districts to provide critical community services in the face of significant population growth and inflation.</p>
<p>Modifying the limitation on the growth of property tax collections will restore the primary tool local officials use to fund law enforcement, fire departments, and other services Washingtonians rely on.</p>
<p>Property taxes are the primary revenue source for counties, which have responsibility in Washington for public safety and administration of the criminal justice system.</p>

<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The property taxes must have been imposed upon a residence which was occupied by the person claiming the exemption as a principal place of residence as of the time of filing. However, any person who sells, transfers, or is displaced from his or her residence may transfer his or her exemption status to a replacement residence, but no claimant may receive an exemption on more than one residence in any year. Moreover, confinement of the person to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, adult family home, or home of a relative for the purpose of long-term care does not disqualify the claim of exemption if:</p>

<p>The residence is occupied by a spouse or a domestic partner and/or a person financially dependent on the claimant for support; or</p>

For purposes of this subsection, a residence owned by a marital community or state registered domestic partnership or owned by cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse or each domestic partner or each cotenant, and any lease for life is deemed a life estate;</p>

<p>If the income of the person claiming exemption is reduced for two or more months of the assessment year by reason of the death of the person's spouse or the person's domestic partner, or when other substantial changes occur in disposable income that are likely to continue for an indefinite period of time, the combined disposable income of such person must be calculated by multiplying the average monthly combined disposable income of such person after such occurrences by 12.</p>
