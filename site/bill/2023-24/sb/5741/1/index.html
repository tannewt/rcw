<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the costs of housing in Washington have drastically risen over the past decade due largely to housing underproduction and population growth, as evidenced by a 95 percent increase in the purchase price of single-family housing, according to the United States federal housing financial agency federal reserve economic data. Together with a significant increase in regulation targeting housing providers at the local and state level, housing providers have been leaving the market in record numbers. As a result, the state does not have enough housing, especially affordable housing, to serve the needs of its citizens. The reduced supply of rental housing units, coupled with a growing population, has also led to higher rental rates, especially in the Puget Sound region and urban centers across the state. The legislature finds that investing in a housing gap voucher pilot program will allow the state to target rental assistance to the people most in need of assistance and support the rental housing partnership that exists among residents, housing providers, and the state of Washington, which is necessary for a healthy rental housing market.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2023, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, public housing authorities shall implement and administer a housing gap voucher pilot program to provide rental assistance for seniors, low-income families, and members of marginalized communities living in manufactured housing or rental housing in Washington. Public housing authorities must administer the program under this section to ensure access to affordable housing, promote housing stability for individuals and families who qualify for rental assistance, and encourage access to housing for seniors, low income, and diverse populations of residents.</p>
</li>

<p>Manufactured housing and rental housing eligible for use in the program must be located in the state of Washington and shall comply with applicable state and local health, housing, building, and safety codes.</p>

Public housing authorities may require the resident to provide reliable third-party verification of all necessary information. Public housing authorities may find any resident that fails to provide such information ineligible for continued participation. Public housing authorities shall use the information provided to annually determine whether the housing gap voucher and share of rent should be adjusted and whether the resident is eligible for continued program participation. If the resident's share of the rent is adjusted during the annual review, the amount of the voucher payment shall be adjusted accordingly.</p>
