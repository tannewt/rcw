# SB 5462 - Inclusive learning standards

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5462.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that Washington state law prohibits discrimination in public schools for certain protected classes. The legislature also acknowledges that school districts are required to adopt a policy related to the selection or removal of instructional materials. Under state rule, the instructional materials policy of each school district must establish and use appropriate screening criteria to identify and eliminate bias pertaining to protected classes.

2. The legislature intends to expand these requirements by requiring school districts to adopt policies and procedures that incorporate selecting inclusive instructional materials that include the histories, contributions, and perspectives of historically marginalized and underrepresented groups.

3. The legislature further recognizes that state law requires the state learning standards to be periodically updated to incorporate best practices in ethnic studies. The legislature intends to build on this duty by directing the office of the superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the Washington state LGBTQ commission, to review and update relevant state learning standards to include the histories, contributions, and perspectives of LGBTQ people.

4. The legislature believes that promoting inclusive learning standards and instructional materials will improve student achievement, attendance, parent and family engagement, and other dimensions that contribute to student success.

## Section 2
1. By June 1, 2025, the Washington state school directors' association, with the assistance of the office of the superintendent of public instruction, must review and update a model policy and procedure regarding course design, selection, and adoption of instructional materials.
