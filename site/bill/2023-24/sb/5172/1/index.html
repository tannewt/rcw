<p>The sovereign people hereby declare that every individual possesses a fundamental right of privacy with respect to personal reproductive decisions.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is the public policy of the state of Washington that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every individual has the fundamental right to choose or refuse birth control;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every woman has the fundamental right to choose or refuse to have an abortion, except as specifically limited by this section and RCW 9.02.110 through 9.02.170 , 9.02.900 , and 9.02.902;</p>

<li>
<p>Except as specifically permitted by this section and RCW 9.02.110 through 9.02.170 , 9.02.900 , and 9.02.902, the state shall not deny or interfere with a woman's fundamental right to choose or refuse to have an abortion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman seeking to have an abortion in the state of Washington has a right to be fully informed about abortions and the potential risks associated with abortions. This includes the right to know about:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>The state may not deny or interfere with a woman's right to choose to have an abortion prior to viability of the fetus, or to protect her life or health.</p>
<p>A physician may terminate and a health care provider may assist a physician in terminating a pregnancy as permitted by this section.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unless authorized by RCW 9.02.110, any person who performs an abortion on another person shall be guilty of a class C felony punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>The good faith judgment of a physician as to viability of the fetus or as to the risk to life or health of a woman and the good faith judgment of a health care provider as to the duration of pregnancy shall be a defense in any proceeding in which a violation of this chapter is an issue.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>The regulation is consistent with established medical practice; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of the available alternatives, the regulation imposes the least restrictions on the woman's right to have an abortion as defined by RCW 9.02.100 through 9.02.170 , 9.02.900 , and 9.02.902.</p>
</li>
