<li>
<p>When a designated crisis responder files a petition for initial detention under RCW 71.05.150 or 71.05.153 on the grounds that the person presents a likelihood of serious harm, the petition shall include a copy of the person's driver's license or identicard or comparable information such as their name, address, and date of birth. If the person is not subsequently committed for involuntary treatment under RCW 71.05.240, the court shall forward within three business days of the probable cause hearing a copy of the person's driver's license or identicard, or comparable information, along with the date of release from the facility, to the department of licensing and to the Washington state patrol firearms background check program, who shall forward the information to the national instant criminal background check system index, denied persons file, created by the federal Brady handgun violence prevention act (P.L. 103-159). Upon expiration of the six-month period during which the person's right to possess a firearm is suspended as provided in RCW 71.05.182, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program must remove the person from the national instant criminal background check system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of the information provided for by subsection (1) of this section, the department of licensing shall determine if the detained person has a concealed pistol license. If the person does have a concealed pistol license, the department of licensing shall immediately notify the license-issuing authority, which, upon receipt of such notification, shall immediately suspend the license for a period of six months from the date of the person's release from the facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm by reason of having been detained under RCW 71.05.150 or 71.05.153 may, upon discharge, petition the superior court to have his or her right to possess a firearm restored before the six-month suspension period has elapsed by following the procedures provided in RCW 9.41.047(3).</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A dealer may not deliver a firearm frame or receiver to a purchaser or transferee unless the dealer first conducts a background check of the applicant through the state firearms background check system and the requirements or time periods in RCW 9.41.092 (1) and (2) have been satisfied.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A signed application for the purchase or transfer of a firearm frame or receiver shall constitute a waiver of confidentiality and written request that the health care authority, mental health institutions, and other health care facilities release, to an inquiring court, law enforcement agency, or the Washington state patrol firearms background check program, information relevant to the applicant's eligibility to possess a firearm. Any mental health information received by a court, law enforcement agency, or the Washington state patrol firearms background check program pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed except as provided in RCW 42.56.240(4).</p>

<li>
<p>A person may file a voluntary waiver of firearm rights, either in writing or electronically, with the clerk of the court in any county in Washington state. The clerk of the court must request a physical or scanned copy of photo identification to verify the person's identity prior to accepting the form. The person filing the form may provide the name of a family member, mental health professional, substance use disorder professional, or alternate person to be contacted if the filer attempts to purchase a firearm while the voluntary waiver of firearm rights is in effect or if the filer applies to have the voluntary waiver revoked. The clerk of the court must immediately give notice to the person filing the form and any listed family member, mental health professional, substance use disorder professional, or alternate person if the filer's voluntary waiver of firearm rights has been accepted. The notice must state that the filer's possession or control of a firearm is unlawful under RCW 9.41.040(7) and that any firearm in the filer's possession or control should be surrendered immediately. By the end of the business day, the clerk of the court must transmit the accepted form to the Washington state patrol firearms background check program. The Washington state patrol firearms background check program must enter the voluntary waiver of firearm rights into the national instant criminal background check system and any other federal or state computer-based systems used by law enforcement agencies or others to identify prohibited purchasers of firearms within twenty-four hours of receipt of the form. Copies and records of the voluntary waiver of firearm rights shall not be disclosed except to law enforcement agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A filer of a voluntary waiver of firearm rights may update the contact information for any family member, mental health professional, substance use disorder professional, or alternate person provided under subsection (1) of this section by making an electronic or written request to the clerk of the court in the same county where the voluntary waiver of firearm rights was filed. The clerk of the court must request a physical or scanned copy of photo identification to verify the person's identity prior to updating the contact information on the form. By the end of the business day, the clerk of the court must transmit the updated contact information to the Washington state patrol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No sooner than seven calendar days after filing a voluntary waiver of firearm rights, the person may file a revocation of the voluntary waiver of firearm rights, either in writing or electronically, in the same county where the voluntary waiver of firearm rights was filed. The clerk of the court must request a physical or scanned copy of photo identification to verify the person's identity prior to accepting the form. By the end of the business day, the clerk of the court must transmit the form to the Washington state patrol firearms background check program and to any family member, mental health professional, substance use disorder professional, or alternate person listed on the voluntary waiver of firearm rights. Within seven days of receiving a revocation of a voluntary waiver of firearm rights, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program must remove the person from the national instant criminal background check system, and any other federal or state computer-based systems used by law enforcement agencies or others to identify prohibited purchasers of firearms in which the person was entered, unless the person is otherwise ineligible to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.040, and destroy all records of the voluntary waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person who knowingly makes a false statement regarding their identity on the voluntary waiver of firearm rights form or revocation of waiver of firearm rights form is guilty of false swearing under RCW 9A.72.040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither a voluntary waiver of firearm rights nor a revocation of a voluntary waiver of firearm rights shall be considered by a court in any legal proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A voluntary waiver of firearm rights may not be required of an individual as a condition for receiving employment, benefits, or services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All records obtained and all reports produced, as required by this section, are not subject to disclosure through the public records act under chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall report each instance where an application for the purchase or transfer of a firearm is denied as the result of a background check that indicates the applicant is ineligible to possess a firearm to the local law enforcement agency in the jurisdiction where the attempted purchase or transfer took place. The reported information must include the identifying information of the applicant, the date of the application and denial of the application, the basis for the denial of the application, and other information deemed appropriate by the Washington state patrol firearms background check program.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Upon appeal of a background check denial, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program shall immediately remove the record of the person from its electronic database accessible to law enforcement agencies and officers and keep a separate record of the person's information until such time as the appeal has been resolved.

</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of satisfactory proof that a person is no longer ineligible to possess a firearm under state or federal law, the Washington state patrol firearms background check program must remove any record of the person's denied firearms purchase or transfer application from its electronic database accessible to law enforcement agencies and officers.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Notify the dealer without delay that the records indicate the individual is prohibited from possessing a firearm and the transfer is denied or that the individual is approved to complete the transfer.
