# SB 6254 - Student navigational support

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6254-S.pdf)

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that Washington stands among the top 10 states for job opportunities requiring education beyond high school, and that large majorities of high school students self-report aspirations to continue their education beyond 12th grade. However, only an estimated 40 percent of Washington's high school class of 2021 is projected to obtain a postsecondary credential. This issue is particularly pressing for students from lower income households. The legislature further recognizes that the real or perceived cost of postsecondary education is a critical systemic barrier that impedes prospective students from applying and enrolling in postsecondary education. This is despite Washington boasting one of the most expansive and equitable set of state-level postsecondary financial aid programs in the country. The legislature further recognizes that counseling, advising, and coaching that help students with the postsecondary financial aid, application, and enrollment processes, and that provide hands-on assistance, are proven approaches to increasing rates of postsecondary enrollment. In order to broaden access to student navigational supports, Washington should invest in student navigational supports and services to advise students to and through postsecondary education and training. Therefore, it is the legislature's intent to establish a financial aid completion and postsecondary enrollment pilot program for the purposes of informing Washington high school students of postsecondary financial aid and educational opportunities as well as encouraging completion of financial aid and postsecondary enrollment.

## Section 2
Subject to availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the college board shall administer a financial aid completion and postsecondary enrollment pilot program for every educational service district.

1. The college board shall, in consultation with the office of the superintendent of public instruction, select community or technical colleges to participate in the pilot program. The college board may also consider tribal organizations or community-based organizations to participate in the pilot program if deemed appropriate for the context of a given educational service district. The colleges or organizations selected to participate must include at least one college or organization from each educational service district. Colleges or organizations selected to participate shall employ outreach and enrollment specialists to work directly with the high schools located in the corresponding educational service district. It is the legislature's intent that the outreach and enrollment specialists be employed at a ratio of one to 600 high school seniors within the corresponding educational service district. The outreach and enrollment specialists shall make significant contact with high school students and their families, with a focus on those households who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program, medicaid, or other similar public benefit programs, for the purpose of increasing free application for federal student aid and Washington application for state financial aid completion rates. The outreach and enrollment specialists shall use the free application for federal student aid and Washington application for state financial aid data maintained by the student achievement council to conduct targeted outreach and free application for federal student aid and Washington application for state financial aid completion assistance to high school seniors. The outreach and enrollment specialists shall also provide information on how to access private scholarships.

The outreach and enrollment specialists shall assist students in exploring college services and programs to improve their skills and increase academic achievement, with a focus on those students who are eligible for public benefit programs, for the purpose of helping students reach their education and career goals. The student achievement council, the college board, an organization representing the public four-year institutions of higher education, and an organization representing the private four-year institutions of higher education shall collaborate in preparing a training program for outreach and enrollment specialists.

3. In collaboration with the office of the superintendent of public instruction, the college board shall outline the roles and responsibilities of colleges, tribal organizations, community-based organizations, and educational service districts to ensure outreach and enrollment specialists have the necessary resources and support to effectively engage with students to promote postsecondary enrollment and financial aid completion. Resources and support may include, but are not limited to, providing: Access to buildings, adequate meeting spaces, certain technology, and school supplies. The college board should also include a communication plan to students and families about the presence and role of outreach and enrollment specialists.
