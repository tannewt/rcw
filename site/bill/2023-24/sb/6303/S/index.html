<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to advance Washington state as a national and worldwide leader in clean energy technology. The legislature recognizes that the state has a unique opportunity to attract manufacturers of energy storage systems and component parts. By providing tax preferences to attract energy storage systems manufacturers to Washington state, this policy supports the production of energy storage systems, which will play an integral role in achieving the state's bold goals for decarbonization. This policy creates a competitive economic environment to produce clean energy, increases Washington state's sustainable energy workforce through creating lasting family-wage jobs in the clean energy sector, and further solidifies Washington state as the gold standard for clean energy policy.</p>
