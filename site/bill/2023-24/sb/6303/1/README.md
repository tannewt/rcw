# SB 6303 - Providing tax incentives to encourage energy storage system and component parts manufacturing in Washington.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6303.pdf)

## Section 1
It is the intent of the legislature to advance Washington state as a national and worldwide leader in clean energy technology. The legislature recognizes that the state has a unique opportunity to attract manufacturers of energy storage systems and component parts. By providing tax preferences to attract energy storage systems manufacturers to Washington state, this policy supports the production of energy storage systems, which will play an integral role in achieving the state's bold goals for decarbonization. This policy creates a competitive economic environment to produce clean energy, increases Washington state's sustainable energy workforce through creating lasting family-wage jobs in the clean energy sector, and further solidifies Washington state as the gold standard for clean energy policy.

## Section 2
1. Beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2040, upon every person engaging within this state in the business of making sales at retail or wholesale of energy storage systems, component parts used in the manufacture of energy storage systems, or both, the amount of tax on such business is equal to the gross proceeds of sales of the product manufactured, multiplied by the rate of 0.275 percent.

2. Beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2040, upon every person engaging within this state in the business of manufacturing energy storage systems, component parts used in the manufacture of energy storage systems, or both, the amount of tax on such business is equal to the value of the products manufactured, multiplied by the rate of 0.275 percent.

3. Beginning July 1, 2025, until June 30, 2040, upon every person engaging within this state as a processor for hire of energy storage systems, component parts used in the manufacture of energy storage systems, or both, the amount of tax on such business is equal to the gross income of the business, multiplied by the rate of 0.275 percent.

4. A person reporting under the tax rate provided in this section must electronically file with the department all returns, forms, and other information the department requires in an electronic format as provided or approved by the department. Any return, form, or information required to be filed in an electronic format under this section is not filed until received by the department in an electronic format. As used in this subsection, "returns" has the same meaning as "return" in RCW 82.32.050.

5. A person reporting under the tax rate provided in this section must file a complete annual tax performance report with the department under RCW 82.32.534.

6. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.

    a. "Energy storage system" means a device or group of devices assembled together, capable of storing energy in order to supply electrical energy at a later time. Energy storage systems include the following categories:

        i. Mechanical systems, including pumped hydro energy storage, gravity storage technologies, compressed air energy storage, and flywheels;

## Section 3
1. Subject to the limits and provisions of this section, a credit is authorized against the tax otherwise due under this chapter for persons engaged in the business of manufacturing energy storage systems, component parts used in the manufacture of energy storage systems, or both.

2. The credit under this section equals $4,000 for each qualified employment position engaged in manufacturing production that takes place in a qualifying facility. A credit is earned for the calendar year a person fills a position. Additionally, a credit is earned for each year the position is maintained over the subsequent consecutive years, up to 10 years, but may not be earned after the date specified in subsection (8) of this section. Those positions that are not filled for the entire year are eligible for 50 percent of the credit if filled less than six months, and the entire credit if filled more than six months.

3. The credit may not exceed the amount of tax due under this chapter. No refunds may be granted for credits under this section. The credit may be claimed against any tax due under this chapter, less any taxable amount for which a credit is allowed under RCW 82.04.440.

4. If at any time the department finds that a person is not eligible for tax credit under this section, the amount of taxes for which a credit has been claimed is immediately due. The department must assess interest, but not penalties, on the taxes for which the person is not eligible. The interest must be assessed at the rate provided for delinquent excise taxes under chapter 82.32 RCW, is retroactive to the date the tax credit was claimed, and accrues until the taxes for which a credit has been used are repaid.

5. A person claiming the credit under this section must file a complete annual tax performance report with the department under RCW 82.32.534.

6. To claim a credit under this chapter, a person must electronically file with the department all returns, forms, and other information the department requires in an electronic format as provided or approved by the department. Any return, form, or information required to be filed in an electronic format under this section is not filed until received by the department in an electronic format. As used in this subsection, "returns" has the same meaning as "return" in RCW 82.32.050.

7. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.

    a. "Energy storage systems" and "component parts used in the manufacturing of energy storage systems" have the same meanings as provided in section 2 of this act.

    b. "Qualified employment position" means a permanent full-time position engaged in manufacturing energy storage systems, component parts used in the manufacture of energy storage systems, or both. If an employee is either voluntarily or involuntarily separated from employment, the employment position is considered filled on a full-time basis if the employer is either training or actively recruiting a replacement employee and the cumulative period of any vacancies in that position is not more than 120 days in the four-quarter period.

    c. "Qualifying facility" means a facility primarily used for manufacturing energy storage systems, component parts used in the manufacture of energy storage systems, or both.

8.
