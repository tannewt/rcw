    b. Research related to the implementation and enforcement of Washington court rules and ethical rules related to public defense services;

    c. Data collection and analysis related to the provision of right to counsel services in Washington, including workload of public defense providers, the resources available to public defense providers, and the independence of public defense providers;

    d. Courtroom observations focusing on the following:

        i. The process individuals experience as their cases advance from accusation through disposition;

        iii. The substantive laws and procedural rules that govern the criminal legal system in which indigent representation is provided; and

    e. Recommendations for improving the provision and quality of right to counsel services.
