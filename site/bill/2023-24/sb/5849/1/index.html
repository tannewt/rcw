<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Beginning with the 2029 graduating class, all students shall be required to show competency in the high school learning standards related to computer science in order to graduate from high school. Students may demonstrate this computer science competency graduation requirement through:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Completion of a stand-alone computer science course aligned to the state learning standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion of a different subject matter course where the state computer science learning standards are embedded with other learning standards; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A demonstration of competency of the foundational skills established in the computer science state learning standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The demonstration of competency could include completion of a competency examination as established in RCW 28A.230.300 or any of the options allowed by the rules adopted by the state board of education under RCW 28A.230.090 that address mastery-based crediting, such as: (i) Completing a locally established portfolio or culminating project; (ii) participating in supervised work experience or other outside school experience; (iii) taking career and technical education classes; (iv) taking courses offered by regional or community centers or programs; (v) receiving credits earned at a postsecondary institution; or (vi) providing documentation of a prior learning activity that demonstrates proficiency of the identified learning standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consideration of seat time or instructional hours is not required to demonstrate competency for purposes of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students must be allowed to present multiple types of evidence for the demonstration of competency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students in grade 12 who have not been able to show computer science competency because of previous residence outside the state may have the requirement of this section waived by their principal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section increases the number of high school credits required for graduation as established by the state board of education under RCW 28A.230.090.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall develop state learning standards that identify the knowledge and skills all public school students need to know and be able to do based on the student learning goals in RCW 28A.150.210, develop student assessments, and implement the accountability recommendations and requests regarding assistance, rewards, and recognition of the state board of education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Periodically revise the state learning standards, as needed, based on the student learning goals in RCW 28A.150.210. Goals one and two shall be considered primary. To the maximum extent possible, the superintendent shall integrate technology literacy and fluency from goal three and the knowledge and skill areas in the other goals in the state learning standards; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review and prioritize the state learning standards and identify, with clear and concise descriptions, the grade level content expectations to be assessed on the statewide student assessment and used for state or federal accountability purposes. The review, prioritization, and identification shall result in more focus and targeting with an emphasis on depth over breadth in the number of grade level content expectations assessed at each grade level. Grade level content expectations shall be articulated over the grades as a sequence of expectations and performances that are logical, build with increasing depth after foundational knowledge and skills are acquired, and reflect, where appropriate, the sequential nature of the discipline. The office of the superintendent of public instruction, within seven working days, shall post on its website any grade level content expectations provided to an assessment vendor for use in constructing the statewide student assessment.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>In consultation with the state board of education, the superintendent of public instruction shall maintain and continue to develop and revise a statewide academic assessment system in the content areas of reading, writing, mathematics, and science for use in the elementary, middle, and high school years designed to determine if each student has mastered the state learning standards identified in subsection (1) of this section. School districts shall administer the assessments under guidelines adopted by the superintendent of public instruction. The academic assessment system may include a variety of assessment methods, including criterion-referenced and performance-based measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effective with the 2009 administration of the Washington assessment of student learning and continuing with the statewide student assessment, the superintendent shall redesign the assessment in the content areas of reading, mathematics, and science in all grades except high school by shortening test administration and reducing the number of short answer and extended response questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the 2014-15 school year, the superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the state board of education, shall modify the statewide student assessment system to transition to assessments developed with a multistate consortium, as provided in this subsection:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The assessments developed with a multistate consortium to assess student proficiency in English language arts and mathematics shall be administered beginning in the 2014-15 school year, and beginning with the graduating class of 2020, the assessments must be administered to students in the tenth grade. The reading and writing assessments shall not be administered by the superintendent of public instruction or schools after the 2013-14 school year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high school assessments in English language arts and mathematics in (c)(i) of this subsection shall be used for the purposes of federal and state accountability and for assessing student career and college readiness.</p>
