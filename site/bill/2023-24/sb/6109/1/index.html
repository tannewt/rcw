<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids pose a unique and growing threat to the safety of children in Washington state. The legislature further finds that state action is necessary to prevent critical incidents and death of vulnerable children in the wake of the fentanyl epidemic statewide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1227 was enacted in 2021 and took full effect July 1, 2023. In enacting Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1227, the legislature stated that it found that children and families are better served when the state provides support to allow children to be cared for by loved ones and in their own communities. The legislature renews and reaffirms this intent and also recognizes the unprecedented risk of fatality to children posed by the presence or exposure to fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to provide clarity to judges, social workers, advocates, and families and direct guidance about the safety threat that highly potent synthetic opioids pose to vulnerable children. The legislature declares that the presence or exposure of highly potent synthetic opioids should be given great weight in determining whether a child is in imminent physical harm as a result of abuse or neglect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes the challenges for recovery and rehabilitation regarding opioid use and resolves to increase services and supports. The legislature further resolves to increase training and resources for state and judicial employees to accomplish their mission and goals in a safe and effective manner.</p>

<li>
<p>The court may enter an order directing a law enforcement officer, probation counselor, or child protective services official to take a child into custody if: (i) A petition is filed with the juvenile court with sufficient corroborating evidence to establish that the child is dependent; (ii) the allegations contained in the petition, if true, establish that there are reasonable grounds to believe that removal is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm to the child due to child abuse or neglect; and (iii) an affidavit or declaration is filed by the department in support of the petition setting forth specific factual information evidencing insufficient time to serve a parent with a dependency petition and hold a hearing prior to removal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child abuse or neglect establishing the basis for a determination of imminent physical harm under (a) of this subsection may include, but is not limited to, child abuse or neglect resulting from:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Sexual abuse;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexual exploitation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presence of a high-potency synthetic opioid in the home or exposure of the child to a high-potency synthetic opioid; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pattern of severe neglect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall give great weight to the presence of a high-potency synthetic opioid in the home or exposure of the child by a parent, guardian, or legal custodian to a high-potency synthetic opioid, which may require removal of the child to prevent imminent physical harm due to child abuse or neglect. When evaluating whether the presence of a high-potency synthetic opioid in the home or exposure of the child by a parent, guardian, or legal custodian to a high-potency synthetic opioid necessitates removal of the child, the court shall consider the following factors:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Age of the child or children in the home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the child is particularly vulnerable given the child's medical or developmental conditions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk of accidental ingestion or inhalation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any petition that does not have the necessary affidavit or declaration demonstrating a risk of imminent harm requires that the parents are provided notice and an opportunity to be heard before the order may be entered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petition and supporting documentation must be served on the parent, and if the child is in custody at the time the child is removed, on the entity with custody other than the parent. If the court orders that a child be taken into custody under subsection (1) of this section, the petition and supporting documentation must be served on the parent at the time of the child's removal unless, after diligent efforts, the parents cannot be located at the time of removal. If the parent is not served at the time of removal, the department shall make diligent efforts to personally serve the parent. Failure to effect service does not invalidate the petition if service was attempted and the parent could not be found.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-102">Section 102 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-102">¶</a></h2>
<p>(1)(a) When a child is removed or when the petitioner is seeking the removal of a child from the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the court shall hold a shelter care hearing within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The primary purpose of the shelter care hearing is to determine whether the child can be immediately and safely returned home while the adjudication of the dependency is pending. The court shall hold an additional shelter care hearing within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays if the child is removed from the care of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian at any time after an initial shelter care hearing under this section.</p>

<p>Except as provided in RCW 26.44.030(12), upon the receipt of a report alleging that abuse or neglect has occurred, the law enforcement agency or the department must investigate and provide the protective services section with a report in accordance with chapter 74.13 RCW, and where necessary to refer such report to the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A law enforcement officer may take, or cause to be taken, a child into custody without a court order if there is probable cause to believe that taking the child into custody is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm to the child due to child abuse or neglect and the child would be seriously injured or could not be taken into custody if it were necessary to first obtain a court order pursuant to RCW 13.34.050. The law enforcement agency or the department investigating such a report is hereby authorized to photograph such a child for the purpose of providing documentary evidence of the physical condition of the child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child abuse or neglect establishing the basis for a determination of imminent physical harm under subsection (2) of this section may include, but is not limited to, child abuse or neglect resulting from:</p>

<p>An administrator of a hospital or similar institution or any physician, licensed pursuant to chapters 18.71 or 18.57 RCW, may detain a child without consent of a person legally responsible for the child whether or not medical treatment is required, if there is probable cause to believe that detaining the child is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm to the child due to child abuse or neglect and the child would be seriously injured or could not be taken into custody if it were necessary to first obtain a court order under RCW 13.34.050: PROVIDED, That such administrator or physician shall notify or cause to be notified the appropriate law enforcement agency or child protective services pursuant to RCW 26.44.040. Such notification shall be made as soon as possible and in no case longer than 72 hours. Such temporary protective custody by an administrator or doctor shall not be deemed an arrest.

<p>When any person, in his or her official supervisory capacity with a nonprofit or for-profit organization, has reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect caused by a person over whom he or she regularly exercises supervisory authority, he or she shall report such incident, or cause a report to be made, to the proper law enforcement agency, provided that the person alleged to have caused the abuse or neglect is employed by, contracted by, or volunteers with the organization and coaches, trains, educates, or counsels a child or children or regularly has unsupervised access to a child or children as part of the employment, contract, or voluntary service. No one shall be required to report under this section when he or she obtains the information solely as a result of a privileged communication as provided in RCW 5.60.060.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing in this subsection (1)(b) shall limit a person's duty to report under (a) of this subsection.</p>

c. The reporting requirement also applies to department of corrections personnel who, in the course of their employment, observe offenders or the children with whom the offenders are in contact. If, as a result of observations or information received in the course of his or her employment, any department of corrections personnel has reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect, he or she shall report the incident, or cause a report to be made, to the proper law enforcement agency or to the department as provided in RCW 26.44.040.

d. The reporting requirement shall also apply to any adult who has reasonable cause to believe that a child who resides with them, has suffered severe abuse, and is able or capable of making a report.

<li>
<p>The reporting requirement of subsection (1) of this section does not apply to the discovery of abuse or neglect that occurred during childhood if it is discovered after the child has become an adult. However, if there is reasonable cause to believe other children are or may be at risk of abuse or neglect by the accused, the reporting requirement of subsection (1) of this section does apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other person who has reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect may report such incident to the proper law enforcement agency or to the department as provided in RCW 26.44.040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, upon receiving a report of an incident of alleged abuse or neglect pursuant to this chapter, involving a child who has died or has had physical injury or injuries inflicted upon him or her other than by accidental means or who has been subjected to alleged sexual abuse, shall report such incident to the proper law enforcement agency, including military law enforcement, if appropriate. In emergency cases, where the child's welfare is endangered, the department shall notify the proper law enforcement agency within twenty-four hours after a report is received by the department. In all other cases, the department shall notify the law enforcement agency within seventy-two hours after a report is received by the department. If the department makes an oral report, a written report must also be made to the proper law enforcement agency within five days thereafter.</p>

<li>
<p>Any law enforcement agency receiving a report of an incident of alleged abuse or neglect pursuant to this chapter, involving a child who has died or has had physical injury or injuries inflicted upon him or her other than by accidental means, or who has been subjected to alleged sexual abuse, shall report such incident in writing as provided in RCW 26.44.040 to the proper county prosecutor or city attorney for appropriate action whenever the law enforcement agency's investigation reveals that a crime may have been committed. The law enforcement agency shall also notify the department of all reports received and the law enforcement agency's disposition of them. In emergency cases, where the child's welfare is endangered, the law enforcement agency shall notify the department within twenty-four hours. In all other cases, the law enforcement agency shall notify the department within seventy-two hours after a report is received by the law enforcement agency.</p>

<li>
<p>The department may conduct ongoing case planning and consultation with those persons or agencies required to report under this section, with consultants designated by the department, and with designated representatives of Washington Indian tribes if the client information exchanged is pertinent to cases currently receiving child protective services. Upon request, the department shall conduct such planning and consultation with those persons required to report under this section if the department determines it is in the best interests of the child. Information considered privileged by statute and not directly related to reports required by this section must not be divulged without a valid written waiver of the privilege.</p>

<li>
<p>Any case referred to the department by a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW on the basis of an expert medical opinion that child abuse, neglect, or sexual assault has occurred and that the child's safety will be seriously endangered if returned home, the department shall file a dependency petition unless a second licensed physician of the parents' choice believes that such expert medical opinion is incorrect. If the parents fail to designate a second physician, the department may make the selection. If a physician finds that a child has suffered abuse or neglect but that such abuse or neglect does not constitute imminent danger to the child's health or safety, and the department agrees with the physician's assessment, the child may be left in the parents' home while the department proceeds with reasonable efforts to remedy parenting deficiencies.</p>

<p>Upon receiving a report that a child is a candidate for foster care as defined in RCW 26.44.020, the department may provide prevention and family services and programs to the child's parents, guardian, or caregiver. The department may not be held civilly liable for the decision regarding whether to provide prevention and family services and programs, or for the provision of those services and programs, for a child determined to be a candidate for foster care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receiving a report of alleged abuse or neglect, the department shall make reasonable efforts to learn the name, address, and telephone number of each person making a report of abuse or neglect under this section. The department shall provide assurances of appropriate confidentiality of the identification of persons reporting under this section. If the department is unable to learn the information required under this subsection, the department shall only investigate cases in which:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department believes there is a serious threat of substantial harm to the child;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report indicates conduct involving a criminal offense that has, or is about to occur, in which the child is the victim; or</p>

<li>
<p>Provide voluntary services to families based on the results of the initial family assessment. If a family refuses voluntary services, and the department cannot identify specific facts related to risk or safety that warrant assignment to investigation under this chapter, and there is not a history of reports of child abuse or neglect related to the family, then the department must close the family assessment response case. However, if at any time the department identifies risk or safety factors that warrant an investigation under this chapter, then the family assessment response case must be reassigned to investigation;</p>

In addition, the department may use a family assessment response to assess for and provide prevention and family services and programs, as defined in RCW 26.44.020, for the following children and their families, consistent with requirements under the federal family first prevention services act and this section:

    i. A child who is a candidate for foster care, as defined in RCW 26.44.020; and

    ii. A child who is in foster care and who is pregnant, parenting, or both.

d. The department may not be held civilly liable for the decision to respond to an allegation of child abuse or neglect by using the family assessment response under this section unless the state or its officers, agents, or employees acted with reckless disregard.

The interviews may be conducted on school premises, at day-care facilities, at the child's home, or at other suitable locations outside of the presence of parents. If the allegation is investigated, parental notification of the interview must occur at the earliest possible point in the investigation that will not jeopardize the safety or protection of the child or the course of the investigation. Prior to commencing the interview the department or law enforcement agency shall determine whether the child wishes a third party to be present for the interview and, if so, shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate the child's wishes.
