# SB 6109 - Children and families

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6109-S.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids pose a unique and growing threat to the safety of children in Washington state. The legislature finds that since 2018 there has been a significant increase in the number of child fatalities involving fentanyl within 12 months of the family's involvement in the child welfare system. The legislature further finds that state action is necessary to prevent critical incidents and death of vulnerable children in the wake of the fentanyl epidemic statewide.

2. The legislature recognizes that Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1227 was enacted in 2021 and took full effect July 1, 2023. In enacting Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1227, the legislature stated that it found that children and families are better served when the state provides support to allow children to be cared for by loved ones and in their own communities. The legislature renews and reaffirms this intent and also recognizes the unprecedented risk of fatality to children posed by the presence or exposure to fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids. The legislature finds that even in very small quantities, high-potency synthetic opioids may be lethal to a child.

3. The legislature intends to provide clarity to judges, social workers, advocates, and families and direct guidance about the risk of lethality that high-potency synthetic opioids pose to children. The legislature declares that endangerment with high-potency synthetic opioids may necessitate removal of a child to prevent imminent physical harm due to child abuse or neglect.

4. The legislature recognizes the challenges for recovery and rehabilitation regarding opioid use and resolves to increase services and supports. The legislature further resolves to increase training and resources for state and judicial employees to accomplish their mission and goals in a safe and effective manner.

## Section 101
1. [Empty]

    a. The court may enter an order directing a law enforcement officer, probation counselor, or child protective services official to take a child into custody if: (i) A petition is filed with the juvenile court with sufficient corroborating evidence to establish that the child is dependent; (ii) the allegations contained in the petition, if true, establish that there are reasonable grounds to believe that removal is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm to the child due to child abuse or neglect; and (iii) an affidavit or declaration is filed by the department in support of the petition setting forth specific factual information evidencing insufficient time to serve a parent with a dependency petition and hold a hearing prior to removal.

    b. The child abuse or neglect establishing the basis for a determination of imminent physical harm under (a) of this subsection may include, but is not limited to, child abuse or neglect resulting from:

        i. Sexual abuse;

        ii. Sexual exploitation;

        iii. A pattern of severe neglect; or

        iv. Endangerment with high-potency synthetic opioids. Endangerment with high-potency synthetic opioids occurs when a parent, guardian, or legal custodian knowingly or intentionally creates a risk that a child will be harmed from exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or contact with high-potency synthetic opioids. When evaluating whether endangerment with high-potency synthetic opioids necessitates removal of the child to prevent imminent physical harm due to child abuse or neglect, the court shall consider at a minimum the following factors:

(A) Public health guidelines and best practices;

(B) Age of the child or children in the home; and

(C) Whether the child is particularly vulnerable given the child's medical or developmental conditions.

2. Any petition that does not have the necessary affidavit or declaration demonstrating a risk of imminent harm requires that the parents are provided notice and an opportunity to be heard before the order may be entered.

3. The petition and supporting documentation must be served on the parent, and if the child is in custody at the time the child is removed, on the entity with custody other than the parent. If the court orders that a child be taken into custody under subsection (1) of this section, the petition and supporting documentation must be served on the parent at the time of the child's removal unless, after diligent efforts, the parents cannot be located at the time of removal. If the parent is not served at the time of removal, the department shall make diligent efforts to personally serve the parent. Failure to effect service does not invalidate the petition if service was attempted and the parent could not be found.

## Section 102
(1)(a) When a child is removed or when the petitioner is seeking the removal of a child from the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the court shall hold a shelter care hearing within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The primary purpose of the shelter care hearing is to determine whether the child can be immediately and safely returned home while the adjudication of the dependency is pending. The court shall hold an additional shelter care hearing within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays if the child is removed from the care of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian at any time after an initial shelter care hearing under this section.

## Section 103
1. Except as provided in RCW 26.44.030(12), upon the receipt of a report alleging that abuse or neglect has occurred, the law enforcement agency or the department must investigate and provide the protective services section with a report in accordance with chapter 74.13 RCW, and where necessary to refer such report to the court.

2. A law enforcement officer may take, or cause to be taken, a child into custody without a court order if there is probable cause to believe that taking the child into custody is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm to the child due to child abuse or neglect and the child would be seriously injured or could not be taken into custody if it were necessary to first obtain a court order pursuant to RCW 13.34.050. The law enforcement agency or the department investigating such a report is hereby authorized to photograph such a child for the purpose of providing documentary evidence of the physical condition of the child.

3. The child abuse or neglect establishing the basis for a determination of imminent physical harm under subsection (2) of this section may include, but is not limited to, child abuse or neglect resulting from:

    a. Sexual abuse;

    b. Sexual exploitation;

    c. A pattern of severe neglect; or

    d. Endangerment with high-potency synthetic opioids as described in RCW 13.34.050.

## Section 104
1. [Empty]

    a. An administrator of a hospital or similar institution or any physician, licensed pursuant to chapters 18.71 or 18.57 RCW, may detain a child without consent of a person legally responsible for the child whether or not medical treatment is required, if there is probable cause to believe that detaining the child is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm to the child due to child abuse or neglect and the child would be seriously injured or could not be taken into custody if it were necessary to first obtain a court order under RCW 13.34.050: PROVIDED, That such administrator or physician shall notify or cause to be notified the appropriate law enforcement agency or child protective services pursuant to RCW 26.44.040. Such notification shall be made as soon as possible and in no case longer than 72 hours. Such temporary protective custody by an administrator or doctor shall not be deemed an arrest. Child protective services may detain the child until the court assumes custody, but in no case longer than 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.

    b. The child abuse or neglect establishing the basis for a determination of imminent physical harm under (a) of this subsection may include, but is not limited to, child abuse or neglect resulting from:

        i. Sexual abuse;

        ii. Sexual exploitation;

        iii. A pattern of severe neglect; or

        iv. Endangerment with high-potency synthetic opioids as described in RCW 13.34.050.

2. A child protective services employee, an administrator, doctor, or law enforcement officer shall not be held liable in any civil action for the decision for taking the child into custody, if done in good faith under this section.
