# SB 5983 - Syphilis treatment

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5983-S.E.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes Washington's syphilis epidemic continues to grow, causing long-term health consequences and deaths that are preventable. Between 2019 and 2021, the number of reported syphilis cases in Washington state increased by 49 percent, while the number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis, an early stage infection characterized by a high risk of transmission, increased by 79 percent.

2. In 2021, the legislature funded the sexually transmitted infection and hepatitis B virus legislative advisory group which produced policy recommendations in 2022 that included allowing medical assistants with telehealth access to a supervising clinician to provide intramuscular injections for syphilis treatment. It is the intent of the legislature to increase access to syphilis treatment to populations with high rates of syphilis and who are at the most risk of serious health outcomes due to syphilis infection.

## Section 3
1. Notwithstanding any other law, a health care provider who diagnoses a case of sexually transmitted chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, or other sexually transmitted infection, as determined by the department or recommended in the most recent federal centers for disease control and prevention guidelines for the prevention or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, in an individual patient may prescribe, dispense, furnish, or otherwise provide prescription antibiotic drugs to the individual patient's sexual partner or partners without examination of that patient's partner or partners or having an established provider and patient relationship with the partner or partners. This practice shall be known as expedited partner therapy.

2. A health care provider may provide expedited partner therapy as outlined in subsection (1) of this section if all the following requirements are met:

4. If a health care provider does not have the name of a patient's sexual partner for a drug prescribed under subsection (1) of this section, the prescription shall include the words "expedited partner therapy" or "EPT."

5.
