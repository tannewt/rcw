# SB 5983 - Allowing medical assistants with telehealth supervision to provide intramuscular injections for syphilis treatment.

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5983.pdf)

## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes Washington's syphilis epidemic continues to grow, causing long-term health consequences and deaths that are preventable. Between 2019 and 2021, the number of reported syphilis cases in Washington state increased by 49 percent, while the number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis, an early stage infection characterized by a high risk of transmission, increased by 79 percent.

2. In 2021, the legislature funded the sexually transmitted infection and hepatitis B virus legislative advisory group which produced policy recommendations in 2022 that included allowing medical assistants with telehealth access to a supervising clinician to provide intramuscular injections for syphilis treatment. It is the intent of the legislature to increase access to syphilis treatment to populations with high rates of syphilis and who are at the most risk of serious health outcomes due to syphilis infection.
