<li>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state's safe haven law, allowing the safe transfer of newborns, has been effective in providing parents with a safe option to transfer their newborns.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the safe haven law should be further expanded to allow the safe transfer of newborns less than 31 days old to provide parents a safe option for transferring newborns older than 72 hours.</p>
