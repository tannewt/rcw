## Section 401
It is hereby declared by the sovereign people to be the public policy of the state of Washington:

1. That political campaign and lobbying contributions and expenditures be fully disclosed to the public and that secrecy is to be avoided.

2. That the people have the right to expect from their elected representatives at all levels of government the utmost of integrity, honesty, and fairness in their dealings.

3. That the people shall be assured that the private financial dealings of their public officials, and of candidates for those offices, present no conflict of interest between the public trust and private interest.

4. That our representative form of government is founded on a belief that those entrusted with the offices of government have nothing to fear from full public disclosure of their financial and business holdings, provided those officials deal honestly and fairly with the people.

5. That public confidence in government at all levels is essential and must be promoted by all possible means.

6. That public confidence in government at all levels can best be sustained by assuring the people of the impartiality and honesty of the officials in all public transactions and decisions.

7. That the concept of attempting to increase financial participation of individual contributors in political campaigns is encouraged by the passage of the Revenue Act of 1971 by the Congress of the United States, and in consequence thereof, it is desirable to have implementing legislation at the state level.

8. That the concepts of disclosure and limitation of election campaign financing are established by the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 by the Congress of the United States, and in consequence thereof it is desirable to have implementing legislation at the state level.

9. That small contributions by individual contributors are to be encouraged, and that not requiring the reporting of small contributions may tend to encourage such contributions.

10. That the public's right to know of the financing of political campaigns and lobbying and the financial affairs of elected officials and candidates far outweighs any right that these matters remain secret and private.

11. That, mindful of the right of individuals to privacy and of the desirability of the efficient administration of government, full access to information concerning the conduct of government on every level must be assured as a fundamental and necessary precondition to the sound governance of a free society.

The provisions of this title shall be liberally construed to promote complete disclosure of all information respecting the financing of political campaigns and lobbying, and the financial affairs of elected officials and candidates, and full access to public records so as to assure continuing public confidence of fairness of elections and governmental processes, and so as to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In promoting such complete disclosure, however, this title shall be enforced so as to ensure that the information disclosed will not be misused for arbitrary and capricious purposes and to ensure that all persons reporting under this title will be protected from harassment and unfounded allegations based on information they have freely disclosed.

## Section 402
Elections of conservation district supervisors held pursuant to chapter 89.08 RCW shall not be considered general or special elections for purposes of the campaign disclosure and personal financial affairs reporting requirements of this title. Elected conservation district supervisors are not considered elected officials for purposes of the annual personal financial affairs reporting requirement of this title.

## Section 403
All statements and reports filed under this title shall be public records of the agency where they are filed, and shall be available for public inspection and copying during normal business hours at the expense of the person requesting copies, provided that the charge for such copies shall not exceed actual cost to the agency.

## Section 404
1. For each required report, as technology permits, the commission shall make an electronic reporting tool available to all those who are required to file that report under this title.

2. All persons required to file reports under this title must file them electronically where the commission has provided an electronic option. The executive director may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis for persons who lack the technological ability to file reports electronically.

3. If the electronic filing system provided by the commission is inoperable for any period of time, the commission must keep a record of the date and time of each instance and post outages on its website. If a report is due on a day the electronic filing system is inoperable, it is not late if filed the first business day the system is back in operation. The commission must provide notice to all reporting entities when the system is back in operation.

4. All persons required to file reports under this title shall, at the time of initial filing, provide the commission an email address, or other electronic contact information, that shall constitute the official address for purposes of all communications from the commission. The person required to file one or more reports must provide any new electronic contact information to the commission within 10 days, if the address has changed from that listed on the most recent report. Committees must provide the committee treasurer's electronic contact information to the commission. Committees must also provide any new electronic contact information for the committee's treasurer to the commission within 10 days of the change. The executive director may waive the electronic contact information requirement and allow use of a postal address, upon the showing of hardship.

## Section 405
It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that the commission provide the general public timely access to all contribution and expenditure reports submitted by candidates, continuing political committees, bona fide political parties, lobbyists, and lobbyists' employers. The legislature finds that failure to meet goals for full and timely disclosure threatens to undermine our electoral process.

Furthermore, the legislature intends for the commission to consult with the office of the chief information officer as it seeks to implement chapter 401, Laws of 1999, and that the commission follow the standards and procedures established by the office of the chief information officer in chapter 43.105 RCW as they relate to information technology.

## Section 406
By July 1st of each year, the commission shall calculate the following performance measures, provide a copy of the performance measures to the governor and appropriate legislative committees, and make the performance measures available to the public:

1. The average number of days that elapse between the commission's receipt of reports filed under RCW 42.17A.205 (as recodified by this act), 42.17A.225 (as recodified by this act), 42.17A.235 (as recodified by this act), 42.17A.255 (as recodified by this act), 42.17A.265 (as recodified by this act), 42.17A.600 (as recodified by this act), 42.17A.615 (as recodified by this act), 42.17A.625 (as recodified by this act), and 42.17A.630 (as recodified by this act) and the time that the report, a copy of the report, or a copy of the data or information included in the report, is first accessible to the general public (a) in the commission's office, and (b) via the commission's website;

    c. The provisions of this subsection do not relieve a commissioner of any applicable disqualification and recusal requirements.

4. A vacancy on the commission shall be filled within 30 days of the vacancy by the governor, with the consent of the senate, and the appointee shall serve for the remaining term of the appointee's predecessor. A vacancy shall not impair the powers of the remaining commissioners to exercise all of the powers of the commission.

5. Three commissioners shall constitute a quorum. The commission shall elect its own chair and adopt its own rules of procedure in the manner provided in chapter 34.05 RCW.

6. Commissioners shall be compensated in accordance with RCW 43.03.250 and shall be reimbursed for travel expenses incurred while engaged in the business of the commission as provided in RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060.

12. Maintain and make available to the public and political committees of this state a toll-free telephone number.

## Section 409
In addition to the duties in RCW 42.17A.105 (as recodified by this act), the commission may:

1. Adopt, amend, and rescind suitable administrative rules to carry out the policies and purposes of this title, which rules shall be adopted under chapter 34.05 RCW.

2. Appoint an executive director and set, within the limits established by the office of financial management under RCW 43.03.028, the executive director's compensation. The executive director shall perform such duties and have such powers as the commission may prescribe and delegate to implement and enforce this title efficiently and effectively. The commission shall not delegate its authority to adopt, amend, or rescind rules nor may it delegate authority to determine that a violation of this title has occurred or to assess penalties for such violations;

10. Make available and keep current on its website a glossary of all defined terms in this title and in rules adopted by the commission.

## Section 410
1. The commission may suspend or modify any of the reporting requirements of this title if it finds that literal application of this title works a manifestly unreasonable hardship in a particular case and the suspension or modification will not frustrate the purposes of this title. The commission may suspend or modify reporting requirements only to the extent necessary to substantially relieve the hardship and only after a hearing is held and the suspension or modification receives approval. A suspension or modification of the financial affairs reporting requirements in RCW 42.17A.710 (as recodified by this act) may be approved for an elected official's term of office or for up to three years for an executive state officer. If a material change in the applicant's circumstances or relevant information occurs or has occurred, the applicant must request a modification at least one month prior to the next filing deadline rather than at the conclusion of the term.

2. A manifestly unreasonable hardship exists if reporting the name of an entity required to be reported under RCW 42.17A.710(1)(g)(ii) (as recodified by this act) would be likely to adversely affect the competitive position of any entity in which the person filing the report, or any member of the person's immediate family, holds any office, directorship, general partnership interest, or an ownership interest of 10 percent or more.

3. Requests for reporting modifications may be heard in a brief adjudicative proceeding as set forth in RCW 34.05.482 through 34.05.494 and in accordance with the standards established in this section. The commission, the commission chair acting as presiding officer, or another commissioner appointed by the chair to serve as presiding officer, may preside over a brief adjudicatory proceeding. If a modification is requested by a filer because of a concern for personal safety, the information submitted regarding that safety concern shall not be made public prior to, or at, the hearing on the request. Any information provided or prepared for the modification hearing shall remain exempt from public disclosure under this title and chapter 42.56 RCW to the extent it is determined at the hearing that disclosure of such information would present a personal safety risk to a reasonable person.

4. If the commission, or presiding officer, grants a modification request, the commission or presiding officer may apply the modification retroactively to previously filed reports. In that event, previously reported information of the kind that is no longer being reported is confidential and exempt from public disclosure under this title and chapter 42.56 RCW.

5. Any citizen has standing to bring an action in Thurston county superior court to contest the propriety of any order entered under this section within one year from the date of the entry of the order.

6. The commission shall adopt rules governing the proceedings.

## Section 411
At least once every five years, but no more often than every two years, the commission must consider whether to revise the monetary contribution limits and reporting thresholds and code values of this title. If the commission chooses to make revisions, the revisions shall be only for the purpose of recognizing economic changes as reflected by an inflationary index recommended by the office of financial management, and may be rounded off to amounts as determined by the commission to be most accessible for public understanding. The revisions shall be guided by the change in the index for the period commencing with the month of December preceding the last revision and concluding with the month of December preceding the month the revision is adopted. As to each of the three general categories of this title, reports of campaign finance, reports of lobbyist activity, and reports of the financial affairs of elected and appointed officials, the revisions shall equally affect all thresholds within each category. The revisions authorized by this subsection shall reflect economic changes from the time of the last legislative enactment affecting the respective code or threshold.

Revisions made in accordance with this section shall be adopted as rules in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW.

## Section 412
The attorney general, through his or her office, shall provide assistance as required by the commission to carry out its responsibilities under this chapter title. The commission may employ attorneys who are neither the attorney general nor an assistant attorney general to carry out any function of the attorney general prescribed in this chapter title.

## Section 413
1. Except as provided in subsections (2), (3), and (7) of this section, the reporting provisions of this title do not apply to:

    a. Candidates, elected officials, and agencies in political subdivisions with fewer than 2,000 registered voters as of the date of the most recent general election in the jurisdiction;

    b. Political committees formed to support or oppose candidates or ballot propositions in such political subdivisions; or

    c. Persons making independent expenditures in support of or opposition to such ballot propositions.

2. The reporting provisions of this title apply in any exempt political subdivision from which a "petition for disclosure" containing the valid signatures of 15 percent of the number of registered voters, as of the date of the most recent general election in the political subdivision, is filed with the commission. The commission shall by rule prescribe the form of the petition. After the signatures are gathered, the petition shall be presented to the auditor or elections officer of the county, or counties, in which the political subdivision is located. The auditor or elections officer shall verify the signatures and certify to the commission that the petition contains no less than the required number of valid signatures. The commission, upon receipt of a valid petition, shall order every known affected person in the political subdivision to file the initially required statement and reports within 14 days of the date of the order.

3. The reporting provisions of this title apply in any exempt political subdivision that by ordinance, resolution, or other official action has petitioned the commission to make the provisions applicable to elected officials and candidates of the exempt political subdivision. A copy of the action shall be sent to the commission. If the commission finds the petition to be a valid action of the appropriate governing body or authority, the commission shall order every known affected person in the political subdivision to file the initially required statement and reports within 14 days of the date of the order.

4. The commission shall void any order issued by it pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section when, at least four years after issuing the order, the commission is presented a petition or official action so requesting from the affected political subdivision. Such petition or official action shall meet the respective requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section.

5. Any petition for disclosure, ordinance, resolution, or official action of an agency petitioning the commission to void the exemption in RCW 42.17A.200(3) (as recodified by this act) shall not be considered unless it has been filed with the commission:

    a. In the case of a ballot proposition, at least 60 days before the date of any election in which campaign finance reporting is to be required;

    b. In the case of a candidate, at least 60 days before the first day on which a person may file a declaration of candidacy for any election in which campaign finance reporting is to be required.

6. Any person exempted from reporting under this title may at the person's option file the statement and reports.

7. The reporting provisions of this title apply to a candidate in any political subdivision if the candidate receives or expects to receive five thousand dollars or more in contributions.

## Section 414
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the date of receipt of any properly addressed application, report, statement, notice, or payment required to be made under the provisions of this title is the date shown by the post office cancellation mark on the envelope of the submitted material. The provisions of this section do not apply to reports required to be delivered under RCW 42.17A.265 (as recodified by this act) and 42.17A.625 (as recodified by this act).

2. When a report is filed electronically with the commission, it is deemed to have been received on the file transfer date. The commission shall notify the filer of receipt of the electronically filed report. Such notification may be sent by mail or electronically. If the notification of receipt of the electronically filed report is not received by the filer, the filer may offer proof of sending the report, and such proof shall be treated as if it were a receipt sent by the commission. Electronic filing may be used for purposes of filing the special reports required to be delivered under RCW 42.17A.265 (as recodified by this act) and 42.17A.625 (as recodified by this act).

## Section 415
Every report and statement required to be filed under this title shall identify the person preparing it, and shall be certified as complete and correct, both by the person preparing it and by the person on whose behalf it is filed.

## Section 416
The commission must preserve statements or reports required to be filed under this title for not less than 10 years.

## Section 417
1. The commission may apply for and obtain a superior court order approving and authorizing a subpoena in advance of its issuance. The application may be made in Thurston county, the county where the subpoenaed person resides or is found, or the county where the subpoenaed documents, records, or evidence are located. The application must:

    a. State that an order is sought under this section;

    b. Adequately specify the documents, records, evidence, or testimony; and

    c. Include a declaration made under oath that an investigation is being conducted for a lawfully authorized purpose related to an investigation within the commission's authority and that the subpoenaed documents, records, evidence, or testimony are reasonably related to an investigation within the commission's authority.

2. When an application under this section is made to the satisfaction of the court, the court must issue an order approving the subpoena. An order under this subsection constitutes authority of law for the agency to subpoena the documents, records, evidence, or testimony.

3. The commission may seek approval and a court may issue an order under this section without prior notice to any person, including the person to whom the subpoena is directed and the person who is the subject of an investigation. An application for court approval is subject to the fee and process set forth in RCW 36.18.012(3).

## Section 418
The provisions of this title relating to the financing of election campaigns shall apply in all election campaigns other than (1) for precinct committee officer; (2) for a federal elective office; and (3) for an office of a political subdivision of the state that does not encompass a whole county and that contains fewer than 5,000 registered voters as of the date of the most recent general election in the subdivision, unless required by RCW 42.17A.135 (2) through (5) and (7) (as recodified by this act).

Such deposits shall be made within five business days of receipt of the contribution.

    c. Transfers of funds that must be reported under RCW 42.17A.240(6) as recodified by this act are not made from more than one such account.

3. Nothing in this section prohibits a candidate or political committee from investing funds on hand in a depository in bonds, certificates, or tax-exempt securities, or in savings accounts or other similar instruments in financial institutions, or in mutual funds other than the depository but only if:

    a. The commission is notified in writing of the initiation and the termination of the investment; and

    b. The principal of such investment, when terminated together with all interest, dividends, and income derived from the investment, is deposited in the depository in the account from which the investment was made and properly reported to the commission before any further disposition or expenditure.

## Section 433
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Timely disclosure to voters of the identity and sources of funding for electioneering communications is vitally important to the integrity of state, local, and judicial elections.

    b. Electioneering communications that identify political candidates for state, local, or judicial office and that are distributed 60 days before an election for those offices are intended to influence voters and the outcome of those elections.

    c. The state has a compelling interest in providing voters information about electioneering communications in political campaigns concerning candidates for state, local, or judicial office so that voters can be fully informed as to the: (i) Source of support or opposition to those candidates; and (ii) identity of persons attempting to influence the outcome of state, local, and judicial candidate elections.

    d. Nondisclosure of financial information about advertising that masquerades as relating only to issues and not to candidate campaigns fosters corruption or the appearance of corruption. These consequences can be substantially avoided by full disclosure of the identity and funding of those persons paying for such advertising.

    e. The United States supreme court held in , 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003) that speakers seeking to influence elections do not possess an inviolable free speech right to engage in electioneering communications regarding elections, including when issue advocacy is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. Therefore, such election campaign communications can be regulated and the source of funding disclosed.

    f. The state has a sufficiently compelling interest in preventing corruption in political campaigns to justify and restore contribution limits and restrictions on the use of soft money in RCW 42.17A.405 (as recodified by this act). Those interests include restoring restrictions on the use of such funds for electioneering communications, as well as the laws preventing circumvention of those limits and restrictions.

2. Based upon the findings in this section, chapter 445, Laws of 2005 is narrowly tailored to accomplish the following and is intended to:

    a. Improve the disclosure to voters of information concerning persons and entities seeking to influence state, local, and judicial campaigns through reasonable and effective mechanisms, including improving disclosure of the source, identity, and funding of electioneering communications concerning state, local, and judicial candidate campaigns;

    b. Regulate electioneering communications that mention state, local, and judicial candidates and that are broadcast, mailed, erected, distributed, or otherwise published right before the election so that the public knows who is paying for such communications;

    c. Reenact and amend the contribution limits in RCW 42.17A.405 (7) and (15) (as recodified by this act) and the restrictions on the use of soft money, including as applied to electioneering communications, as those limits and restrictions were in effect following the passage of chapter 2, Laws of 1993 (Initiative Measure No. 134) and before the state supreme court decision in , 141 Wn.2d 245, 4 P.3d 808 (2000). The commission is authorized to fully restore the implementation of the limits and restrictions of RCW 42.17A.405 (7) and (15) (as recodified by this act) in light of , 540 U.S. 93, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). The United States supreme court upheld the disclosure and regulation of electioneering communications in political campaigns, including but not limited to issue advocacy that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy; and

    d. Authorize the commission to adopt rules to implement chapter 445, Laws of 2005.

The commission may determine that reports filed pursuant to this section also satisfy the requirements of RCW 42.17A.255 (as recodified by this act) and 42.17A.260 (as recodified by this act).

5. Failure of any sponsor to report electronically under this section shall be a violation of this title.

If the sponsor is another entity, the certification shall be signed by the individual responsible for authorizing the expenditure on the entity's behalf.

## Section 437
1. All written political advertising, whether relating to candidates or ballot propositions, shall include the sponsor's name and address. All radio and television political advertising, whether relating to candidates or ballot propositions, shall include the sponsor's name. The use of an assumed name for the sponsor of electioneering communications, independent expenditures, or political advertising shall be unlawful. For partisan office, if a candidate has expressed a party or independent preference on the declaration of candidacy, that party or independent designation shall be clearly identified in electioneering communications, independent expenditures, or political advertising.

Paid for by (name, city, state)." If the advertisement or communication is undertaken by a nonindividual other than a party organization, then the following notation must also be included: "Top Five Contributors" followed by a listing of the names of the five persons making the largest aggregate contributions as determined by RCW 42.17A.350(1) (as recodified by this act); and if necessary, the statement "Top Three Donors to PAC Contributors," followed by a listing of the names of the three individuals or entities other than political committees making the largest aggregate contributions to political committees as determined by RCW 42.17A.350(2) (as recodified by this act).

3. It is not a violation of this section for a candidate or his or her agent to make statements described in subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section about the candidate himself or herself because a person cannot defame himself or herself. It is not a violation of this section for a person or organization referenced in subsection (1)(c) of this section to make a statement about that person or organization because such persons and organizations cannot defame themselves.

4. Any violation of this section shall be proven by clear and convincing evidence. If a violation is proven, damages are presumed and do not need to be proven.

## Section 440

4. The sponsor shall not be liable for a violation of this section that occurs because a contribution to any political committee identified under subsection (1) of this section has not been reported to the commission.

5. The commission is authorized to adopt rules, as needed, to prevent ways to circumvent the purposes of the required disclosures in this section to inform voters about the individuals and entities sponsoring political advertisements.

## Section 443
1. The people of the state of Washington find and declare that:

    a. The financial strength of certain individuals or organizations should not permit them to exercise a disproportionate or controlling influence on the election of candidates.

    b. Rapidly increasing political campaign costs have led many candidates to raise larger percentages of money from special interests with a specific financial stake in matters before state government. This has caused the public perception that decisions of elected officials are being improperly influenced by monetary contributions.

    c. Candidates are raising less money in small contributions from individuals and more money from special interests. This has created the public perception that individuals have an insignificant role to play in the political process.

2. By limiting campaign contributions, the people intend to:

    a. Ensure that individuals and interest groups have fair and equal opportunity to influence elective and governmental processes;

    b. Reduce the influence of large organizational contributors; and

    c. Restore public trust in governmental institutions and the electoral process.

This subsection does not apply to loans made in the ordinary course of business.

8.

2. Unless authorized by subsection (3) of this section or otherwise expressly authorized by law, no public funds may be used directly or indirectly for lobbying. However, this does not prevent officers or employees of an agency from communicating with a member of the legislature on the request of that member; or communicating to the legislature, through the proper official channels, requests for legislative action or appropriations that are deemed necessary for the efficient conduct of the public business or actually made in the proper performance of their official duties. This subsection does not apply to the legislative branch.

3. Any agency, not otherwise expressly authorized by law, may expend public funds for lobbying, but such lobbying activity shall be limited to (a) providing information or communicating on matters pertaining to official agency business to any elected official or officer or employee of any agency or (b) advocating the official position or interests of the agency to any elected official or officer or employee of any agency. Public funds may not be expended as a direct or indirect gift or campaign contribution to any elected official or officer or employee of any agency. For the purposes of this subsection, "gift" means a voluntary transfer of any thing of value without consideration of equal or greater value, but does not include informational material transferred for the sole purpose of informing the recipient about matters pertaining to official agency business. This section does not permit the printing of a state publication that has been otherwise prohibited by law.

4. No elective official or any employee of his or her office or any person appointed to or employed by any public office or agency may use or authorize the use of any of the facilities of a public office or agency, directly or indirectly, in any effort to support or oppose an initiative to the legislature. "Facilities of a public office or agency" has the same meaning as in RCW 42.17A.555 (as recodified by this act) and 42.52.180. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the following activities:

    a. Action taken at an open public meeting by members of an elected legislative body to express a collective decision, or to actually vote upon a motion, proposal, resolution, order, or ordinance, or to support or oppose an initiative to the legislature so long as (i) any required notice of the meeting includes the title and number of the initiative to the legislature, and (ii) members of the legislative body or members of the public are afforded an approximately equal opportunity for the expression of an opposing view;

    b. A statement by an elected official in support of or in opposition to any initiative to the legislature at an open press conference or in response to a specific inquiry;

    c. Activities that are part of the normal and regular conduct of the office or agency;

    d. Activities conducted regarding an initiative to the legislature that would be permitted under RCW 42.17A.555 (as recodified by this act) and 42.52.180 if conducted regarding other ballot measures.

5. Each state agency, county, city, town, municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, or special purpose district that expends public funds for lobbying shall file with the commission, except as exempted by (d) of this subsection, quarterly statements providing the following information for the quarter just completed:

    a. The name of the agency filing the statement;

    c. A listing of expenditures incurred by the agency for lobbying including but not limited to travel, consultant or other special contractual services, and brochures and other publications, the principal purpose of which is to influence legislation;

    d. For purposes of this subsection, "lobbying" does not include:

        i. Requests for appropriations by a state agency to the office of financial management pursuant to chapter 43.88 RCW nor requests by the office of financial management to the legislature for appropriations other than its own agency budget requests;

        ii. Recommendations or reports to the legislature in response to a legislative request expressly requesting or directing a specific study, recommendation, or report by an agency on a particular subject;

        iii. Official reports including recommendations submitted to the legislature on an annual or biennial basis by a state agency as required by law;

        iv. Requests, recommendations, or other communication between or within state agencies or between or within local agencies;

    v. Any other lobbying to the extent that it includes:

(A) Telephone conversations or preparation of written correspondence;

The total expenditures of nonpublic funds made in connection with such lobbying for or on behalf of any one or more members of the legislature or state elected officials or public officers or employees of the state of Washington may not exceed fifteen dollars for any three-month period. The exemption under this subsection (5)(d)(v)(B) is in addition to the exemption provided in (d)(v)(A) of this subsection;

(C) Preparation or adoption of policy positions.

The statements shall be in the form and the manner prescribed by the commission and shall be filed within one month after the end of the quarter covered by the report.

6. In lieu of reporting under subsection (5) of this section, any county, city, town, municipal corporation, quasi municipal corporation, or special purpose district may determine and so notify the public disclosure commission that elected officials, officers, or employees who, on behalf of any such local agency, engage in lobbying reportable under subsection (5) of this section shall register and report such reportable lobbying in the same manner as a lobbyist who is required to register and report under RCW 42.17A.600 (as recodified by this act) and 42.17A.615 (as recodified by this act). Each such local agency shall report as a lobbyist employer pursuant to RCW 42.17A.630 (as recodified by this act).

7. The provisions of this section do not relieve any elected official or officer or employee of an agency from complying with other provisions of this title, if such elected official, officer, or employee is not otherwise exempted.

8. The purpose of this section is to require each state agency and certain local agencies to report the identities of those persons who lobby on behalf of the agency for compensation, together with certain separately identifiable and measurable expenditures of an agency's funds for that purpose. This section shall be reasonably construed to accomplish that purpose and not to require any agency to report any of its general overhead cost or any other costs that relate only indirectly or incidentally to lobbying or that are equally attributable to or inseparable from nonlobbying activities of the agency.

The public disclosure commission may adopt rules clarifying and implementing this legislative interpretation and policy.

    a. If the court finds that the violation of any provision of this title by any candidate, committee, or incidental committee probably affected the outcome of any election, the result of that election may be held void and a special election held within 60 days of the finding. Any action to void an election shall be commenced within one year of the date of the election in question. It is intended that this remedy be imposed freely in all appropriate cases to protect the right of the electorate to an informed and knowledgeable vote.

    b. If any lobbyist or sponsor of any grass roots lobbying campaign violates any of the provisions of this title, the lobbyist's or sponsor's registration may be revoked or suspended and the lobbyist or sponsor may be enjoined from receiving compensation or making expenditures for lobbying. The imposition of a sanction shall not excuse the lobbyist from filing statements and reports required by this title.

However, a person or entity who violates RCW 42.17A.405 (as recodified by this act) may be subject to a civil penalty of ten thousand dollars or three times the amount of the contribution illegally made or accepted, whichever is greater.

    d. When assessing a civil penalty, the court may consider the nature of the violation and any relevant circumstances, including the following factors:

        i. The respondent's compliance history, including whether the noncompliance was isolated or limited in nature, indicative of systematic or ongoing problems, or part of a pattern of violations by the respondent, resulted from a knowing or intentional effort to conceal, deceive or mislead, or from collusive behavior, or in the case of a political committee or other entity, part of a pattern of violations by the respondent's officers, staff, principal decision makers, consultants, or sponsoring organization;

        ii. The impact on the public, including whether the noncompliance deprived the public of timely or accurate information during a time-sensitive period or otherwise had a significant or material impact on the public;

    vi. Whether the respondent or any person benefited politically or economically from the noncompliance;

    vii. Whether there was a personal emergency or illness of the respondent or member of the respondent's immediate family;

    viii. Whether other emergencies such as fire, flood, or utility failure prevented filing;

        ix. Whether there was commission staff or equipment error, including technical problems at the commission that prevented or delayed electronic filing;

    x. The respondent's demonstrated good-faith uncertainty concerning commission staff guidance or instructions;

    xi. Whether the respondent is a first-time filer;

    xii. Good faith efforts to comply, including consultation with commission staff prior to initiation of enforcement action and cooperation with commission staff during enforcement action and a demonstrated wish to acknowledge and take responsibility for the violation;

    xiii. Penalties imposed in factually similar cases; and

    xiv. Other factors relevant to the particular case.

    e. A person who fails to file a properly completed statement or report within the time required by this title may be subject to a civil penalty of ten dollars per day for each day each delinquency continues.

    f. Each state agency director who knowingly fails to file statements required by RCW 42.17A.635 (as recodified by this act) shall be subject to personal liability in the form of a civil penalty in the amount of one hundred dollars per statement. These penalties are in addition to any other civil remedies or sanctions imposed on the agency.

    g. A person who fails to report a contribution or expenditure as required by this title may be subject to a civil penalty equivalent to the amount not reported as required.

    h. Any state agency official, officer, or employee who is responsible for or knowingly directs or expends public funds in violation of RCW 42.17A.635 (2) or (3) (as recodified by this act) may be subject to personal liability in the form of a civil penalty in an amount that is at least equivalent to the amount of public funds expended in the violation.

        i. The court may enjoin any person to prevent the doing of any act herein prohibited, or to compel the performance of any act required herein.

2. The commission may refer the following violations for criminal prosecution:

    a. A person who, with actual malice, violates a provision of this title is guilty of a misdemeanor under chapter 9.92 RCW;

    b. A person who, within a five-year period, with actual malice, violates three or more provisions of this title is guilty of a gross misdemeanor under chapter 9.92 RCW; and

    c. A person who, with actual malice, procures or offers any false or forged document to be filed, registered, or recorded with the commission under this title is guilty of a class C felony under chapter 9.94A RCW.

## Section 491
1. The commission may initiate or respond to a complaint, request a technical correction, or otherwise resolve matters of compliance with this title, in accordance with this section. If a complaint is filed with or initiated by the commission, the commission must:

    a. Dismiss the complaint or otherwise resolve the matter in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, as appropriate under the circumstances after conducting a preliminary review;

    b. Initiate an investigation to determine whether a violation has occurred, conduct hearings, and issue and enforce an appropriate order, in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW and subsection (3) of this section; or

    c. Refer the matter to the attorney general, in accordance with subsection (4) of this section.

2. [Empty]

    a. For complaints of remediable violations or requests for technical corrections, the commission may, by rule, delegate authority to its executive director to resolve these matters in accordance with subsection (1)(a) of this section, provided the executive director consistently applies such authority.

    b. The commission shall, by rule, develop additional processes by which a respondent may agree by stipulation to any allegations and pay a penalty subject to a schedule of violations and penalties, unless waived by the commission as provided for in this section. Any stipulation must be referred to the commission for review. If approved or modified by the commission, agreed to by the parties, and the respondent complies with all requirements set forth in the stipulation, the matter is then considered resolved and no further action or review is allowed.

3. If the commission initiates an investigation, an initial hearing must be held within 90 days of the complaint being filed. Following an investigation, in cases where it chooses to determine whether a violation has occurred, the commission shall hold a hearing pursuant to the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW. Any order that the commission issues under this section shall be pursuant to such a hearing.

    a. The person against whom an order is directed under this section shall be designated as the respondent. The order may require the respondent to cease and desist from the activity that constitutes a violation and in addition, or alternatively, may impose one or more of the remedies provided in RCW 42.17A.750(1) (b) through (h) (as recodified by this act), or other requirements as the commission determines appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this title.

    b. The commission may assess a penalty in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars per violation, unless the parties stipulate otherwise. Any order that the commission issues under this section that imposes a financial penalty must be made pursuant to a hearing, held in accordance with the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW.

    c. The commission has the authority to waive a penalty for a first-time violation. A second violation of the same requirement by the same person, regardless if the person or individual committed the violation for a different political committee or incidental committee, shall result in a penalty. Successive violations of the same requirement shall result in successively increased penalties. The commission may suspend any portion of an assessed penalty contingent on future compliance with this title. The commission must create a schedule to enhance penalties based on repeat violations by the person.

    d. Any order issued by the commission is subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW. If the commission's order is not satisfied and no petition for review is filed within 30 days, the commission may petition a court of competent jurisdiction of any county in which a petition for review could be filed under that jurisdiction, for an order of enforcement. Proceedings in connection with the commission's petition shall be in accordance with RCW 42.17A.760 (as recodified by this act).

4. In lieu of holding a hearing or issuing an order under this section, the commission may refer the matter to the attorney general consistent with this section, when the commission believes:

    a. Additional authority is needed to ensure full compliance with this title;

    b. An apparent violation potentially warrants a penalty greater than the commission's penalty authority; or

    c. The maximum penalty the commission is able to levy is not enough to address the severity of the violation.

5. Prior to filing a citizen's action under RCW 42.17A.775 (as recodified by this act), a person who has filed a complaint pursuant to this section must provide written notice to the attorney general if the commission does not, within 90  days of the complaint being filed with the commission, take action pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. A person must simultaneously provide a copy of the written notice to the commission.

## Section 492
The following procedure shall apply in all cases where the commission has petitioned a court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement of any order it has issued pursuant to this title:

1. A copy of the petition shall be served by certified mail directed to the respondent at his or her last known address. The court shall issue an order directing the respondent to appear at a time designated in the order, not less than five days from the date thereof, and show cause why the commission's order should not be enforced according to its terms.

2. The commission's order shall be enforced by the court if the respondent does not appear, or if the respondent appears and the court finds, pursuant to a hearing held for that purpose:

    a. That the commission's order is unsatisfied;

    b. That the order is regular on its face; and

    c. That the respondent's answer discloses no valid reason why the commission's order should not be enforced or that the respondent had an appropriate remedy by review under RCW 34.05.570(3) and failed to avail himself or herself of that remedy without valid excuse.

3. Upon appropriate application by the respondent, the court may, after hearing and for good cause, alter, amend, revise, suspend, or postpone all or part of the commission's order. In any case where the order is not enforced by the court according to its terms, the reasons for the court's actions shall be clearly stated in writing, and the action shall be subject to review by the appellate courts by certiorari or other appropriate proceeding.

4. The court's order of enforcement, when entered, shall have the same force and effect as a civil judgment.

5. Notwithstanding RCW 34.05.578 through 34.05.590, this section is the exclusive method for enforcing an order of the commission.

Publication of the decision within the 45 day period, or ten-day period, whichever is applicable, shall preclude a citizen's action pursuant to RCW 42.17A.775 (as recodified by this act).

    c. The attorney general should use the enforcement powers in this section in a consistent manner that provides guidance in complying with the provisions of this title to candidates, political committees, or other individuals subject to the regulations of this title.

2. The attorney general may investigate or cause to be investigated the activities of any person who there is reason to believe is or has been acting in violation of this title, and may require any such person or any other person reasonably believed to have information concerning the activities of such person to appear at a time and place designated in the county in which such person resides or is found, to give such information under oath and to produce all accounts, bills, receipts, books, paper and documents which may be relevant or material to any investigation authorized under this title.

3. When the attorney general requires the attendance of any person to obtain such information or produce the accounts, bills, receipts, books, papers, and documents that may be relevant or material to any investigation authorized under this title, the attorney general shall issue an order setting forth the time when and the place where attendance is required and shall cause the same to be delivered to or sent by registered mail to the person at least 14 days before the date fixed for attendance. The order shall have the same force and effect as a subpoena, shall be effective statewide, and, upon application of the attorney general, obedience to the order may be enforced by any superior court judge in the county where the person receiving it resides or is found, in the same manner as though the order were a subpoena. The court, after hearing, for good cause, and upon application of any person aggrieved by the order, shall have the right to alter, amend, revise, suspend, or postpone all or any part of its provisions. In any case where the order is not enforced by the court according to its terms, the reasons for the court's actions shall be clearly stated in writing, and the action shall be subject to review by the appellate courts by certiorari or other appropriate proceeding.

## Section 494
Except as provided in RCW 42.17A.775(4) (as recodified by this act), any action brought under the provisions of this title must be commenced within five years after the date when the violation occurred.

## Section 495

    c. The person who initially filed the complaint with the commission has provided notice of a citizen's action in accordance with subsection (3) of this section and the commission or the attorney general has not commenced action within the 10 days provided under subsection (3) of this section.

3. To initiate the citizen's action, after meeting the requirements under subsection (2) (a) and (b) of this section, a person must notify the attorney general and the commission that the person will commence a citizen's action within 10 days if the commission does not take action authorized under RCW 42.17A.755(1) (as recodified by this act), or the attorney general does not commence an action or publish a decision whether to commence an action pursuant to RCW 42.17A.765(1)(b) (as recodified by this act).

In the case of a citizen's action that is dismissed and that the court also finds was brought without reasonable cause, the court may order the person commencing the action to pay all trial costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the defendant.

## Section 496
In any action brought under this title, the court may award to the commission all reasonable costs of investigation and trial, including reasonable attorneys' fees to be fixed by the court. If the violation is found to have been intentional, the amount of the judgment, which shall for this purpose include the costs, may be trebled as punitive damages.

## Section 498
The public disclosure commission must adopt rules in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter.

During this interim period, the newly elected officials are authorized to adopt ordinances and resolutions which shall become effective on or after the official date of incorporation, and to enter into contracts and agreements to facilitate the transition to becoming a city or town and to ensure a continuation of governmental services after the official date of incorporation. Periods of time that would be required to elapse between the enactment and effective date of such ordinances, including but not limited to times for publication or for filing referendums, shall commence upon the date of such enactment as though the city or town were officially incorporated.

During this interim period, the city or town governing body may adopt rules establishing policies and procedures under the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW, and may use these rules and procedures in making determinations under the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW.

The secretary shall establish policies and procedures for conducting the selection by lot. The policies and procedures shall include, but not be limited to, those for notifying persons selected and for providing a new selection from a congressional district if a person selected from the district declines appointment to the commission or if, following the person's appointment, the person's position on the commission becomes vacant before the end of the person's term of office.

2. Seven commission members, all residents of this state, shall be selected jointly by the speaker of the house of representatives and the president of the senate.

Such a request must be received by the chair before the meeting for which the absence is to be excused. A member's absence from a meeting of the commission may also be excused during the meeting for which the member is absent by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the commission present at the meeting.
