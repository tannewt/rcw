In addition, an employee shall not receive a total of more than five hundred twenty-two days of leave, except that, a supervisor may authorize leave in excess of five hundred twenty-two days in extraordinary circumstances for an employee qualifying for the shared leave program because he or she is suffering from an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition which is of an extraordinary or severe nature. Shared leave received under the uniformed service shared leave pool in RCW 41.04.685 is not included in this total.</p>

In no event may the employee request a transfer of an amount of leave that would result in his or her annual leave account going below ten days.

</li>
<li>
<p>An employee may transfer, under the provisions of this section relating to the transfer of leave, all or part of his or her personal holiday, as that term is defined under RCW 1.16.050, or as such holidays are provided to employees by agreement with a school district's board of directors if the leave transferred under this subsection does not exceed the amount of time provided for personal holidays under RCW 1.16.050.</p>

<p>An employee of an institution of higher education under RCW 28B.10.016, school district, or educational service district who does not accrue annual leave but does accrue sick leave and who has an accrued sick leave balance of more than twenty-two days may request that the head of the agency for which the employee works transfer a specified amount of sick leave to another employee authorized to receive leave under subsection (1) of this section. In no event may such an employee request a transfer that would result in his or her sick leave account going below twenty-two days. Transfers of sick leave under this subsection are limited to transfers from employees who do not accrue annual leave. Under this subsection, &quot;sick leave&quot; also includes leave accrued pursuant to RCW 28A.400.300(1)(b) or 28A.310.240(1) with compensation for illness, injury, and emergencies.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Where any questions arise in the transfer of funds or the adjustment of appropriation authority, the director of financial management shall determine the appropriate transfer or adjustment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave transferred under this section shall not be used in any calculation to determine an agency's allocation of full time equivalent staff positions.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The value of any leave transferred under this section which remains unused shall be returned at its original value to the employee or employees who transferred the leave when the agency head finds that the leave is no longer needed or will not be needed at a future time in connection with the illness or injury for which the leave was transferred or for any other qualifying condition. Unused shared leave may not be returned until one of the following occurs:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The agency head receives from the affected employee a statement from the employee's doctor verifying that the illness or injury is resolved; or</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a shared leave account is closed and an employee later has a need to use shared leave due to the same condition listed in the closed account, the agency head must approve a new shared leave request for the employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent administratively feasible, the value of unused leave which was transferred by more than one employee shall be returned on a pro rata basis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee who uses leave that is transferred to him or her under this section may not be required to repay the value of the leave that he or she used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director of financial management may adopt rules as necessary to implement subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;shortly deplete&quot; means that the employee will have forty hours or less of the applicable leave types under subsection (1)(d) of this section. However, the employee is not required to deplete all of the employee's leave and can maintain up to forty hours of the applicable leave types in reserve.</p>
