## Section 1
No candidate seeking federal elective office may be kept off of any Washington state ballot due to an allegation of federal insurrection or rebellion unless that candidate has been convicted under a federal criminal statute for insurrection or rebellion, and that criminal statute for insurrection or rebellion explicitly enables section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. Any attempt at keeping such a candidate off of the ballot shall be a violation of RCW 29A.84.630.
