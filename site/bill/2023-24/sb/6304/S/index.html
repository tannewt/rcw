</li>
<li>
<p>To support highly impacted communities and vulnerable populations disproportionately burdened by transportation-related emissions and to ensure economic and mobility benefits flow to communities that have historically received less investment in infrastructure, the mapping and forecasting tool must integrate population, health, environmental, and socioeconomic data on a census tract basis. The department may use existing data used by other state or federal agencies. The department must consult with the department of health, the office of equity, the department of ecology, and other agencies as necessary in order to ensure the tool properly integrates cumulative impact analyses best practices and to ensure that the tool is developed in coordination with other state government administrative efforts to identify disproportionately impacted communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mapping and forecasting tool must, to the extent appropriate, integrate related analyses, such as the department of commerce's state energy strategy, the joint transportation committee's public fleet electrification study, the west coast collaborative's alternative fuel infrastructure corridor coalition report, and other related electric vehicle supply equipment assessments as deemed appropriate. To the extent that the mapping and forecasting tool is used by the department as the basis for the identification of recommended future electric vehicle charging sites, the department must consider recommending sites that are colocated with small retailers, including gas stations and convenience stores, and other amenities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where appropriate and feasible, the mapping and forecasting tool must incorporate infrastructure located at or near the border in neighboring state and provincial jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In designing the mapping and forecasting tool, the department must coordinate with the department of commerce, the department of ecology, the utilities and transportation commission, and other state agencies as needed in order to ensure the mapping and forecasting tool is able to successfully facilitate other state agency programs that involve deployment of electric vehicle supply equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must conduct a stakeholder process in developing the mapping and forecasting tool to ensure the tool supports the needs of communities, public agencies, and relevant private organizations. The stakeholder process must involve stakeholders including, but not limited to, electric utilities, early in the development of the tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may contract with the department of commerce or consultants, or both, to develop and implement all or portions of the mapping and forecasting tool. The department may rely on or, to the extent necessary, contract for privately maintained data sufficient to develop the elements specified in subsection (4) of this section.</p>

<h2 id="section-301">Section 301 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-301">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rolling resistance of tires has a significant effect on the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles, and the sales of high rolling resistance replacement tires when low rolling resistance tire technology is in use by new vehicles costs the average gasoline vehicle driver the equivalent of approximately two-thirds the state gas tax;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing of available tires in the United States market, commissioned by the pacific electric and gas company and conducted by an independent consultant, demonstrated no negative correlation between low rolling resistance and tire safety or tire longevity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis conducted by the department's energy policy office shows adoption of reasonable replacement tire energy efficiency standards could result in an approximate cumulative reduction of 600,000,000 gallons of gasoline and 1,500 gigawatt hours of electricity, equating to a savings of $3,000,000,000 in transportation costs for Washington drivers and 5,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from 2026 to 2035, assuming a 10 percent reduction in rolling resistance improves gasoline fuel efficiency by three percent and electricity fuel efficiency by eight percent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transportation electrification strategy required in RCW 43.392.040 concludes that the state must also urgently pursue nonelectrification policies, including lower rolling resistance replacement tires, to comply with the greenhouse gas emissions limits in RCW 70A.45.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing authority to the department to adopt energy efficiency standards for replacement tires sold in the state could therefore lower gasoline and electricity costs for drivers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve public health especially for overburdened communities near highways through reduced transportation-related air pollution.</p>

<h2 id="section-307">Section 307 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-307">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department shall, in consultation with the department of commerce, identify and conduct hazard assessments of the chemical ingredients that are used to achieve reduced rolling resistance in passenger car and light duty truck tires.</p>
<h2 id="section-401">Section 401 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-401">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the idling of vehicles, particularly commercial vehicles, contributes significantly to air quality concerns and greenhouse gas emissions in the state. These impacts particularly impact overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, as commercial truck routes are often located in these communities. Given the improvements in anti-idling technology and standards, it is no longer prudent to allow for the continuation of idling at current rates. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to limit idling of commercial vehicles in Washington.</p>
<h2 id="section-402">Section 402 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-402">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 2, 2025, any person that owns, operates, or causes to operate any diesel-fueled commercial motor vehicle subject to the requirements of this chapter must comply with the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>No vehicle subject to this chapter may idle for more than five consecutive minutes at any location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No diesel-fueled auxiliary power system subject to this chapter may be operated for more than five minutes at any location within 100 feet of a restricted area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Auxiliary power system&quot; means any device that is permanently dedicated to the vehicle on which it is installed and provides electrical, mechanical, or thermal energy to the primary diesel engine, truck cab or sleeper berth, bus passenger compartment, or any other commercial vehicle cab, as an alternative to idling the primary diesel engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Restricted area&quot; means any real property zoned for individual or multifamily housing units, schools, hotels, motels, hospitals, senior care facilities, or child care facilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-403">Section 403 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-403">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department of ecology must initiate a rule-making process to provide for civil penalties and enforcement procedures to implement and enforce section 402 of this act. Such rules must be consistent with rules adopted to implement and enforce motor vehicle emissions standards adopted under RCW 70A.30.010. Such rules must also provide for civil penalties for violations ranging from $300 to $1,000 per violation per day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of ecology may determine, assess, and collect annual fees from commercial motor vehicle owners subject to this chapter in an amount sufficient to cover the direct and indirect costs of administering and enforcing this section. All fees collected under this subsection must be deposited in the idling prevention enforcement account created in section 406 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to penalties imposed under this section, any person who knowingly avoids any required payment of fees or who is more than 90 days late with such payment may be subject to an additional penalty equal to three times the amount of the original fee owed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-404">Section 404 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-404">¶</a></h2>
<p>Compliance with this chapter and any rules adopted under section 403 of this act applies to any person, business, or governmental agency that owns, operates, or causes to operate at any location in Washington state the following equipment:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A diesel-fueled commercial motor vehicle that is licensed to operate in the state of Washington with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any alternative idle reduction technology including, but not limited to, internal combustion engine auxiliary power systems, fuel-fired heaters, battery-electric auxiliary power systems, and other technologies installed on diesel-fueled commercial motor vehicles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-405">Section 405 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-405">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any peace officer, pursuant to RCW 43.43.030, and any air pollution control authority created under chapter 70A.15 RCW may issue civil penalties for violations described under section 402 of this act.</p>
<h2 id="section-406">Section 406 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-406">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idling prevention enforcement account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from fees imposed under section 403(2) of this act and civil penalties generated under this chapter from idling violations must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used for:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enforcement activities required in section 403 of this act and authorized under section 405 of this act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incentives for idle reduction technologies; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incentives for zero emissions vehicles with gross vehicle weight ratings of more than 10,000 pounds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-501">Section 501 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-501">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that to transition Washington's school bus fleet as quickly as the state's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets demand and to significantly improve health outcomes for students and bus drivers, easy-to-access funding must be provided for school districts and for student transportation service contractors to purchase electric school buses on an urgent timeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilizing its expertise from its clean school bus program, the department of ecology must collaborate with the office of the superintendent of public instruction and the department of commerce to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Identify target years for requiring that all new public school bus purchases be for zero emissions school buses and that all public school buses in operation be zero emissions school buses, with consideration of the modeling from the transportation electrification strategy under RCW 43.392.040 and other cost analyses and bus availability projections;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the amount of funding necessary for school districts to cover higher purchase prices before cost parity, bus route planning, facility upgrades, charging infrastructure, and training for technicians and drivers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a funding process recommendation that does not require school districts to apply for state competitive grants separate from other direct funding streams, and that ensures a seamless transition from the department of ecology's clean school bus program, contingent upon receipt of sufficient funding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must collaborate with the department of ecology and department of commerce to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Develop an extension request and approval process that can be made for a zero emissions school bus, if a district can demonstrate the zero emissions school bus will not meet the needs of the school district; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate with school districts through regional transportation coordinators to implement this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
