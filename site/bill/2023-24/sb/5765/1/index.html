<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the replacement and improvement of the Interstate 5 Columbia river bridge is critical for the west coast's transportation system and for the safety of Washington and Oregon drivers. The interstate bridge includes two side-by-side structures built in 1917 and 1958. In 2019, approximately 143,000 vehicles traveled across the interstate bridge each weekday. In 2017, about $71,000,000 in freight commodity value crossed the river each day. Collisions on and near the bridge occur at a rate almost twice as high as other similar urban highways, and the aging bridges are vulnerable to earthquakes. Replacing these structures and making multimodal improvements to facilitate travel in the bistate corridor is essential for the economy of the region. Although Washington state has pledged $1,000,000,000, and expects an equivalent investment of $1,000,000,000 from Oregon state, to help finance replacement of the bridge, funding from tolls and other sources will be necessary to complete and maintain the project. The legislature finds that Oregon state has already authorized tolls to be imposed on the Oregon portion of the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project, and that providing tolling authorization within Washington state will help make the project better situated to receive funding from other sources, including federal funding. As a result, and to align with the efforts of Oregon state, the legislature intends to provide tolling authorization for the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section and sections 3, 4, and 8 of this act, &quot;Interstate 5 bridge replacement project&quot; means the bistate, multimodal corridor improvement program between the state route number 500 interchange in Vancouver, Washington and the Victory Boulevard interchange in Portland, Oregon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Interstate 5 bridge replacement project is designated an eligible toll facility. Tolls are authorized to be imposed on the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project. Tolls may be charged for travel only on the existing and replacement Interstate 5 Columbia river bridges. Tolls may not be charged for travel on the Washington state portion of Interstate 205. Toll revenue generated on the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project must be expended only as allowed under RCW 47.56.820.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the Interstate 5 bridge replacement project, the tolling authority may enter into a bistate agreement with the Oregon state transportation commission regarding the mutual or joint setting, adjustment, and review of toll rates and exemptions as the tolling authority may find necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
