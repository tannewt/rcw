<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state has the second most diverse agricultural sector in the nation with over 15 million acres of farmland and 300 different crops in production. The state's rich soils, diverse microclimates, and transportation networks support market diversity and economic competitiveness within the agricultural sector. Through its institutions of higher education, Washington state supports the development of agricultural knowledge and a robust infrastructure of technical expertise that is deployed across the state to improve agricultural production, protect the environment, and strengthen farming communities.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that organic and regenerative agricultural practices help preserve the environment, support economic growth, and protect human health. Practices such as no-till farming, cover cropping, and rotational grazing improve soil health and reduce carbon emissions. Decreasing the use of pesticides and petroleum-based fertilizers mitigates groundwater pollution, supports biodiversity, and reduces the risks of human, animal, and environmental exposure to toxic materials. There is growing consumer demand for healthy foods and the impacts of climate change, including wildfire smoke, drought, excessive heat, flooding, and new invasive species and pests, amplify the need to increase the use of resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that an increase in organic and regenerative agriculture would protect and improve the state's valuable farmlands, increase the value of the state's agricultural commodities, and help protect farmworkers, their communities, and the environment from exposure to harmful chemicals and practices.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that development of an organic agriculture action plan is needed to increase the amount of organic and regenerative agricultural practices in the state.</p>
