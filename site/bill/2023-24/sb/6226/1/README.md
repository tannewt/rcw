## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that disruption of systemic poverty requires data-informed policies and practices. The legislature further recognizes the importance of appropriate fiscal stewardship of public programs and resources. The legislature declares that policies regarding waste, fraud, and abuse should be rooted in evidence and should be administered in ways that promote racial equity. The legislature intends to create data reporting requirements regarding public service financial accountability to increase transparency within programs.

2. To increase accountability and transparency, the office shall submit a report to the legislature by December 1, 2024, and biannually thereafter, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, that shall include at a minimum the following information:

    c. Findings regarding internal patterns of referrals which may be contributing to disparities; and

    d. Any other information deemed relevant by the department, including potential recommendations to address disparities in program policy and practice.
