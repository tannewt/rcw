<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;design review&quot; means a formally adopted local government process by which projects are reviewed for compliance with design standards for the type of use adopted through local ordinance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, counties and cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 may apply in any design review process only clear and objective development regulations governing the exterior design of new development. For purposes of this section, a clear and objective development regulation:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Must include one or more ascertainable guideline, standard, or criterion by which an applicant can determine whether a given building design is permissible under that development regulation; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May not result in a reduction in density, height, bulk, or scale below the generally applicable development regulations for a development proposal in the applicable zone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of subsection (2) of this section do not apply to development regulations that apply only to designated landmarks or historic districts established under a local preservation ordinance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any design review process must be conducted concurrently, or otherwise logically integrated, with the consolidated review and decision process for project permits set forth in RCW 36.70B.120(3), and no design review process may include more than one public meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county or city must comply with the requirements of this section beginning six months after its next periodic comprehensive plan update required under RCW 36.70A.130.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Each local government is encouraged to adopt further project review provisions to provide prompt, coordinated, and objective review and ensure accountability to applicants and the public, including expedited review for project permit applications for projects that are consistent with adopted development regulations or that include dwelling units that are affordable to low-income or moderate-income households and within the capacity of systemwide infrastructure improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter is intended or shall be construed to prevent a local government from requiring a preapplication conference or a public meeting by rule, ordinance, or resolution, where otherwise required by applicable state law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each local government shall adopt procedures to monitor and enforce permit decisions and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this chapter modifies any independent statutory authority for a government agency to appeal a project permit issued by a local government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A dwelling unit is affordable if it requires payment of monthly housing costs, including utilities other than telephone, of no more than 30 percent of the family's income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Dwelling unit&quot; means a residential living unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons and that includes permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation, and that is sold or rented separately from other dwelling units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Low-income household&quot; means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is less than 80 percent of the median family income, adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development, or less than 80 percent of the city's median income if the project is located in the city, the city has median income of more than 20 percent above the county median income, and the city has adopted an alternative local median income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Moderate-income household&quot; means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is at or below 120 percent of the median household income, adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development, or less than 120 percent of the city's median income if the project is located in the city, the city has median income of more than 20 percent above the county median income, and the city has adopted an alternative local median income.</p>
