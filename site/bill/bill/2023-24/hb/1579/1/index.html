</li>
<li>
<p>The jurisdiction of the independent prosecutions unit applies to any criminal offense involving the use of deadly force by a police officer and any other investigations within the scope of the office of independent investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the alleged criminal offense has been committed by an officer of an agency whom the attorney general provides legal advice and representation, the attorney general must take appropriate steps to assign counsel, staff, and supervision to eliminate any appearance of or actual conflicts of interest.</p>

<li>
<p>In any case involving potential prosecution of a crime involving use of deadly force by a police officer, the prosecuting attorney shall determine if recusal is necessary under the ethical rules applicable to all lawyers or to preserve public confidence. In making this determination, it is improper for the prosecuting attorney to make a determination as to whether criminal charges shall be filed or prosecuted if any of the following exist:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The prosecuting attorney has a relationship with the police officer or the police officer's employing agency, either personally or professionally, such that the prosecuting attorney's decision or pursuit of charges may be materially impacted;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prosecuting attorney has a duty to represent the police officer's employing agency in any civil action related to or arising from the incident under consideration or criminally charged and the prosecuting attorney's decision or pursuit of charges arising from the police officer's use of deadly force may be materially impacted by the duty to defend; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a significant risk that the prosecuting attorney's ability to consider, recommend, or carry out an appropriate course of action will be materially limited as a result of the prosecuting attorney's other responsibilities or interests.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the prosecuting attorney finds recusal is necessary under the ethics rules or to preserve public confidence, the prosecuting attorney must either transfer the case to the independent prosecutions unit of the office of the attorney general within 30 days of receiving the case from the office of independent investigations under chapter 43.102 RCW or other investigating agency or appoint a conflict-free special deputy prosecuting attorney.</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>The appointment of a conflict-free special deputy prosecuting attorney must be in writing signed by the prosecuting attorney and must be filed in the county auditor's office. The appointment is limited to the purposes stated in the writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conflict-free special deputy prosecuting attorney must be the final decision maker as to any matter identified in the appointment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conflict-free special deputy prosecuting attorney may only be removed for cause and with the approval of the superior court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conflict-free special deputy prosecuting attorney must be admitted to practice as an attorney before the courts of this state but need not be a resident of the county in which he or she serves and is not under the legal disabilities attendant upon prosecuting attorneys or their deputies except to avoid any conflict of interest with the purpose for which he or she has been engaged by the prosecuting attorney.</p>

<li>
<p>For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;deadly force&quot; has the meaning provided in RCW 9A.16.010.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two or more prosecuting attorneys may agree that one or more deputies for any one of them may serve temporarily as deputy for any other of them on terms respecting compensation which are acceptable to said prosecuting attorneys. Any such deputy thus serving shall have the same power in all respects as if he or she were serving permanently. The provisions of chapter 39.34 RCW shall not apply to such agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of RCW 41.56.030(12) shall not be interpreted to permit a prosecuting attorney to alter the at-will relationship established between the prosecuting attorney and his or her appointed deputies by this section for a period of time exceeding his or her term of office. Neither shall the provisions of RCW 41.56.030(12) require a prosecuting attorney to alter the at-will relationship established by this section.</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the prosecuting attorney or conflict-free special deputy prosecuting attorney appointed pursuant to RCW 36.27.040 makes a determination not to file criminal charges in the case, the prosecuting attorney or conflict-free special deputy prosecuting attorney must refer the case and all investigative materials concerning the case to the independent prosecutions unit of the office of the attorney general within 30 days of the decision to not file criminal charges.
