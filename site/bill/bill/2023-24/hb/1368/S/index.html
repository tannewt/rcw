<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that zero emission vehicle technology is crucial to protecting Washington's children from the health impacts of fossil fuel emissions and to limiting the long-term impacts of climate change on our planet. Spurred by a supportive regulatory environment, the state has made great advances in recent years that have improved the performance and reduced the costs of such vehicles. With the recent deployment of financial incentives for clean transportation technology under the federal inflation reduction act of 2022, the costs and performance of zero emission vehicles, including zero emission school buses, are forecast to continue to improve in coming years. Zero emission school buses on the market today feature reduced fuel, operations, and maintenance costs compared to their fossil-fueled counterparts. Zero emission school buses also have significant public health benefits for children and are part of a broad-based policy approach to slowing the environmental consequences of climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to transition school districts, charter schools, and state-tribal education compact schools to using only zero emission school buses and to facilitate this transition through the requirements and zero emission school bus grant program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Beginning September 1, 2030, 70 percent of school buses purchased annually by each school district, charter school, or state-tribal education compact school, or used for pupil transportation services contracts under RCW 28A.160.140, must be zero emission school buses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning September 1, 2033, all school buses purchased by school districts, charter schools, or state-tribal education compact schools, or used for pupil transportation services contracts under RCW 28A.160.140, must be zero emission school buses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a school district, charter school, state-tribal education compact school, or contractor that provides pupil transportation services determines that the purchase or contracting of a zero emission school bus is not feasible due to route constraints, it may request a one-time extension for a term not to exceed five years provided that both of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The extension requester can reasonably demonstrate that a planned bus route for transporting pupils to and from school cannot be serviced through available zero emission technology in 2030 for purposes of compliance with subsection (1)(a) of this section, or through available zero emission technology in 2033 for purposes of compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction must receive and, jointly with the department of ecology, evaluate a pupil transportation services provider's request, and grant a one-time extension based on reasonably demonstrating the condition set forth in (a) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;zero emission&quot; means a school bus that produces zero exhaust emission of any air pollutant and any greenhouse gas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the regional transportation coordinators of the educational service districts, shall establish a minimum number of school bus categories considering the capacity and type of vehicles required by school districts in Washington. Once nonzero emission school bus pricing is deemed no longer necessary by the office of the superintendent of public instruction for calculating reimbursement or depreciation payments, these school bus categories must solely include school buses that meet the definition of zero emission in section 2 of this act. The superintendent, in consultation with the regional transportation coordinators of the educational service districts, shall establish competitive specifications for each category of school bus. The categories shall be developed to produce minimum long-range operating costs, including costs of equipment and all costs in operating the vehicles. The competitive specifications shall meet federal motor vehicle safety standards, minimum state specifications as established by rule by the superintendent, and supported options as determined by the superintendent in consultation with the regional transportation coordinators of the educational service districts. The superintendent may solicit and accept price quotes for a rear-engine category school bus that shall be reimbursed at the price of the corresponding front engine category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After establishing school bus categories and competitive specifications, the superintendent of public instruction shall solicit competitive price quotes for base buses from school bus dealers to be in effect for one year and shall establish a list of all accepted price quotes in each category obtained under this subsection. The superintendent shall also solicit price quotes for optional features and equipment and, beginning September 1, 2033, require vendors to ensure that emission-related features meet the definition of zero emission in section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent shall base the level of reimbursement to school districts and educational service districts for school buses on the lowest quote for the base bus in each category. School districts and educational service districts shall be reimbursed for buses purchased only through a lowest-price competitive bid process conducted under RCW 28A.335.190 or through the state bid process established by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding RCW 28A.335.190, school districts and educational service districts may purchase at the quoted price directly from any dealer who is on the list established under subsection (2) of this section. School districts and educational service districts may make their own selections for school buses, but shall be reimbursed at the rates determined under subsection (3) of this section and RCW 28A.160.200. District-selected options shall not be reimbursed by the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not prohibit school districts or educational service districts from conducting their own competitive bid process. However, beginning September 1, 2033, any school buses purchased by school districts, or used for pupil transportation services contracts under RCW 28A.160.140, must be school buses that meet the definition of zero emission in section 2 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction may adopt rules under chapter 34.05 RCW to implement this section.</p>
</li>
