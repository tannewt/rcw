<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall annually review data from local education agencies, including the percentage of students receiving special education services, to ensure there is not a disproportionate identification of students, as defined by the superintendent of public instruction in accordance with federal requirements of the individuals with disabilities education act, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall provide technical assistance to school districts experiencing issues related to disproportionality and will make available professional development opportunities statewide to support local education agencies, schools, and community partners in promoting inclusionary teaching practices within a multitiered system of supports framework to help safeguard against over-identification and other issues related to disproportionality.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that the state's special education funding formula does not result in a limitation on services or excess cost allocations to which students are entitled. To this end, the legislature acknowledges that a comprehensive review of the special education funding formula to examine the impacts of recent modifications and the potential need for future modifications is overdue, including the need to look at enrollment percent caps and minimum threshold values for access to the safety net.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also intends to examine the current accounting and reporting methodologies to ensure that they continue to accurately serve their purpose of providing transparency and accountability and enable the legislature to oversee the state's funding of the program of special education.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint legislative audit and review committee and the state auditor, in consultation with the office of the superintendent of public instruction, must collaborate to conduct a performance audit of the state's system of providing special education services to students with disabilities, including a review of each funding formula component used to allocate resources to school districts for the program of special education and the interplay between those different components. The joint legislative audit and review committee and the state auditor may divide responsibility for the work and reporting required in this section as appropriate, and contract with qualified third-party researchers or higher education institutions to perform any aspect of the report and audit. The report and audit must address:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The prevalence of disabilities and whether the provisions and funding for evaluating students and providing services reflects the prevalence of disabilities, including whether any populations are disparately underevaluated or underserved;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The degree to which changes in funding formulas intended to encourage increased inclusion are successful and whether the state and school districts are utilizing best practices to improve inclusion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the changes in evaluation timelines or increases in the funded enrollment limit have resulted in funding for students who do not have disabilities or in excess of districts' costs to serve students with disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether districts are appropriately accounting for and reporting use of basic education allocations for students with disabilities, including if statutory expectations for use of funds are being met. As part of this review, the joint legislative audit and review committee shall revisit their special education excess cost accounting and reporting requirements report from February 2006 and determine if the special education excess cost accounting methodology and requirements are still functioning as intended with other changes in funding and service delivery focused on inclusion in a general education setting and if additional modifications are recommended;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of funding from levies or other local sources that school districts continue to utilize under current accounting methodologies in order to meet obligations to provide free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities, the degree to which funding shortfalls will continue following planned increases in multipliers, proposed changes to accounting methodologies, and the elimination of a cap on the percent of students for whom the state provides funding; and, options for additional changes to funding formulas to eliminate shortfalls in state funding for special education;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the state may improve recruitment and retention of certificated educators, instructional aides, or paraeducators and professionals serving students with disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the existing special education funding formula components used to allocate resources to school districts in Washington address the actual funding needs of school districts to fully serve all students with disabilities. This review must include an examination of each individual funding formula component including, but not limited to, the use of multiple student weights, the funded percentage cap, and safety net eligibility requirements. This review must also address how the funding formula components interplay within the overall funding model to address the diverse and variable needs of school district special education programs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How Washington's special education funding model compares to different special education funding models used in other states. This review and comparison must identify the strengths and weaknesses of Washington's funding model as compared to other funding models and, at a minimum, review past studies and findings related to Washington's special education funding model. This review must identify which state formulas place a cap or threshold value on the number or percentage of special education students for purposes of generating funding and if those states differ in other ways from the states that do not have a limit, such as using tiered funding formulas or an average dollar allocation per special education student.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop the appropriate scope, define study questions, and select one or more contractors to complete the performance audit and report, the joint legislative audit and review committee and state auditor shall consult with the office of the superintendent of public instruction, the office of the education ombuds, organizations representing and serving students with disabilities, the Washington state special education advisory council, and labor organizations representing educators providing educational services to students with disabilities in developing study questions and choosing appropriate contractors. To address the study questions, the joint legislative audit and review committee and the state auditor may conduct the audit at a sample of school districts as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance audit required by this section must include charter schools to the same extent as school districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon request, the office of financial management and any state or local agency must provide the joint legislative audit and review committee and the state auditor with education records necessary to conduct the performance audit required under this section. The joint legislative audit and review committee and the state auditor shall be considered authorized representatives of relevant state education authorities, including the superintendent of public instruction and the department of children, youth, and families, for the purpose of accessing records for this evaluation. The office of financial management and any state or local agency must provide records within four months from the date of an initial request. The office of financial management or agencies contributing data to the education research and data center must notify the joint legislative audit and review committee and the state auditor's office in writing if they determine a request does not comply with the federal educational rights and privacy act, no later than 21 days after the initial request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the 2024 legislative session, the joint legislative audit and review committee and the state auditor must identify a lead agency for each element of the report and audit defined in subsection (2)(a) through (h) of this section and any aspects of the study that are being conducted by contractors. These designations must be provided to the governor and the committees of the legislature with jurisdiction over fiscal matters and special education by December 31, 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint legislative audit and review committee and the state auditor must, in accordance with RCW 43.01.036, report the study's findings and recommendations to the governor and the committees of the legislature with jurisdiction over fiscal matters and special education by November 30, 2024.</p>

<li>
<p>School districts with a percentage used to calculate the state general apportionment revenue allocated to special education less than 20 percent must be allocated at 20 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a school district's percentage of time students eligible for and receiving special education are served in a general education setting is at least five percentage points greater than its 2022-23 percentage in a school year, the school district's percentage used to calculate the state general apportionment revenue allocated to special education may be reduced by one percentage point for that school year from the 2022-23 percentage.</p>

<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall submit to each regular session of the legislature during an odd-numbered year a programmed budget request for special education programs for students with disabilities. Funding for programs operated by local school districts shall be on an excess cost basis from appropriations provided by the legislature for special education programs for students with disabilities and shall take account of state funds accruing through RCW 28A.150.260 (4)(a), (5), (6), and (8) and 28A.150.415.</p>
