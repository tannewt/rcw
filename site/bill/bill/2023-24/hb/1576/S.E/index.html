<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act shall be known and cited as the dentist and dental hygienist compact. The purposes of this compact are to facilitate the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state the ability to practice in participating states in which they are not licensed. The compact does this by establishing a pathway for dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state to obtain a compact privilege that authorizes them to practice in another participating state in which they are not licensed. The compact enables participating states to protect the public health and safety with respect to the practice of such dentists and dental hygienists, through the state's authority to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the state. The compact:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enables dentists and dental hygienists who qualify for a compact privilege to practice in other participating states without satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a license to practice in those states;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each participating state's acceptance of a compact privilege to practice in that state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases public access to qualified, licensed dentists and dental hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for licensees to practice in participating states;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhances the ability of participating states to protect the public's health and safety;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a participating state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information among participating states;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires dentists and dental hygienists who practice in a participating state pursuant to a compact privilege to practice within the scope of practice authorized in that state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extends the authority of a participating state to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to dentists and dental hygienists who practice in the state through a compact privilege;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotes the cooperation of participating states in regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those states; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.</p>

If a remote state imposes an adverse action against a compact privilege that limits the compact privilege, that adverse action applies to all compact privileges in all remote states.

<li>
<p>All conditions for removal of the compact privilege have been satisfied.</p>

<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>An active military member and their spouse shall not be required to pay to the commission for a compact privilege the fee otherwise charged by the commission.

<li>
<p>A remote state shall have the authority to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the compact and the commission's rules, issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority in a participating state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another participating state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence is located; and</p>
