<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that public schools have the authority to immediately remove a student from school if the student poses an immediate and continuing danger to other students or to school staff, or if the student poses an immediate and continuing threat of material and substantial disruption of the education process. The legislature acknowledges that emergency expulsion is limited to 10 consecutive school days, the school must provide an opportunity for the student to receive educational services during the emergency expulsion, and both the emergency expulsion and any suspension or expulsion that the emergency expulsion is converted to can be appealed. However, the legislature finds that emergency expulsion tarnishes a student's reputation and self-image, which can result in school staff, fellow students, or the student's families making assumptions about the student, and, in some cases, these assumptions result in harassment, intimidation, or bullying of the student. Therefore, the legislature intends to discontinue the use of the prejudicial term &quot;emergency expulsion,&quot; and replace it with the term &quot;emergency removal,&quot; which is a more accurate description of the temporary removal of a student from school to assess and properly respond to an emergent situation involving the student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as possible after the effective date of this section, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must publish a bulletin to notify school districts and public schools that the term &quot;emergency removal&quot; must be used instead of the term &quot;emergency expulsion&quot; in the context of student discipline and as required by RCW 28A.300.042 and 28A.600.015. The legislature's intent as described in subsection (1) of this section must be included in the bulletin. The bulletin must also include guidance about student discipline data collection and historical data comparison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A student who was emergency expelled between September 1, 2019, and the effective date of this section may request that any reference to &quot;emergency expulsion&quot; in the student's education record be revised to &quot;emergency removal.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall adopt and distribute to all school districts lawful and reasonable rules prescribing the substantive and procedural due process guarantees of pupils in the common schools. Such rules shall authorize a school district to use informal due process procedures in connection with the short-term suspension of students to the extent constitutionally permissible: PROVIDED, That the superintendent of public instruction deems the interest of students to be adequately protected. When a student suspension or expulsion is appealed, the rules shall authorize a school district to impose the suspension or expulsion temporarily after an initial hearing for no more than 10 consecutive school days or until the appeal is decided, whichever is earlier. Any days that the student is temporarily suspended or expelled before the appeal is decided shall be applied to the term of the student suspension or expulsion and shall not limit or extend the term of the student suspension or expulsion. An expulsion or suspension of a student may not be for an indefinite period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short-term suspension procedures may be used for suspensions of students up to and including, 10 consecutive school days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emergency removals must end or be converted to another form of corrective action within ten school days from the date of the emergency removal from school. Notice and due process rights must be provided when an emergency removal is converted to another form of corrective action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts may not impose long-term suspension or expulsion as a form of discretionary discipline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any imposition of discretionary and nondiscretionary discipline is subject to the bar on suspending the provision of educational services pursuant to subsection (8) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this chapter, &quot;discretionary discipline&quot; means a disciplinary action taken by a school district for student behavior that violates rules of student conduct adopted by a school district board of directors under RCW 28A.600.010 and this section, but does not constitute action taken in response to any of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A violation of RCW 28A.600.420;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offense in RCW 13.04.155;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two or more violations of RCW 9A.46.120, 9.41.280, 28A.600.455, 28A.635.020, or 28A.635.060 within a three-year period; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavior that adversely impacts the health or safety of other students or educational staff.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in RCW 28A.600.420, school districts are not required to impose long-term suspension or expulsion for behavior that constitutes a violation or offense listed under subsection (6)(a) through (d) of this section and should first consider alternative actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School districts may not suspend the provision of educational services to a student as a disciplinary action. A student may be excluded from a particular classroom or instructional or activity area for the period of suspension or expulsion, but the school district must provide an opportunity for a student to receive educational services during a period of suspension or expulsion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section creates any civil liability for school districts, or creates a new cause of action or new theory of negligence against a school district board of directors, a school district, or the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
