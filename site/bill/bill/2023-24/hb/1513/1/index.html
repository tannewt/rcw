<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The state of Washington and its political subdivisions undertake to protect the safety of all individuals who use public roadways, including people who drive, bike, walk, and roll;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focusing enforcement resources on high-risk behavior such as impaired driving, distracted driving, unrestrained passengers, and speeding, has been shown to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research shows that prioritizing safety stops reduces traffic crash and injury outcomes and reduces racial disparities in traffic stops;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited law enforcement resources are most effective when focused on highest risk behavior, and enforcement only through citations, fines, and fees is not proven to improve road safety and further entangles many low-income road users in the criminal and debt collection systems, causing financial hardship and harming their ability to drive to work and contribute to the economic vitality of the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National and local data show that high discretion, low-risk traffic violations, including those that are unrelated to road safety, fall disproportionately on black, brown, and indigenous road users, as well as low-income road users and people with older vehicles; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biased traffic stops result in a decreased sense of safety for all road users and law enforcement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result of these findings, the legislature has a compelling interest in managing public safety resources to address vehicle violations that impact road safety, and to reduce punitive enforcement of high-discretion traffic violations, so that road safety is improved for all road users.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, a grant program is established. The Washington traffic safety commission shall develop and implement a grant program to support local initiatives that provide solution-oriented responses to nonmoving violations for low-income road users. The commission must prioritize the award of grants to local initiatives that expand or establish civilian intervention programs for nonmoving violations, and focus on nonpunitive interventions such as helmet voucher programs, fee offset programs, fix-it tickets, and repair vouchers that provide solutions for vehicle equipment failures for low-income road users.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grants must be awarded to local jurisdictions based on locally developed proposals to establish or expand existing programs, including programs with community-lead organizations. Eligible jurisdictions under the grant program include cities, counties, tribal government entities, tribal organizations, or nonprofit organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission shall report on its website by December 1st of each year on the recipients, locations, and types of projects funded under this program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning September 1, 2024, and biennially thereafter, the commission shall provide a report to the governor and the transportation committees of the legislature detailing findings on the effectiveness of programs funded under this section and any recommendations for enhancements or modifications to the grant program established under this section.</p>
</li>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>A peace officer may only stop or detain an operator of a vehicle when the primary reason for the stop is an equipment failure violation when necessary to protect against an immediate, serious threat to the safety of the operator or others on the roadway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to stopping the operator of the vehicle under this subsection (1)(b), the peace officer must log digitally or notify dispatch of the primary reason for the stop before initiating, including a detailed description of the immediate, serious threat to the safety of the operator or others on the roadway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon first contact with the operator of the vehicle during a stop under this subsection (1)(b), the peace officer must inform the operator of the reason for the stop, and may not request a consent search of the operator, any passengers, or the vehicle. The peace officer may not question the operator or any passenger of the vehicle on a subject other than the equipment failure violation that initiated the stop, unless the peace officer sees evidence in plain view that establishes reasonable suspicion sufficient to question the operator about an independent criminal offense.</p>
