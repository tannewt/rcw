<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington is facing an unprecedented housing crisis for its current population and a lack of housing choices, and is not likely to meet the affordability goals for future populations. In order to meet the goal of 1,000,000 new homes by 2044, and enhanced quality of life and environmental protection, innovative housing policies will need to be adopted.</p>
<p>Increasing housing options that are more affordable to various income levels is critical to achieving the state's housing goals, including those codified by the legislature under chapter 254, Laws of 2021.</p>
<p>There is continued need for the development of housing at all income levels, including middle housing that will provide a wider variety of housing options and configurations to allow Washingtonians to live near where they work.</p>
<p>Homes developed at higher densities are more affordable by design for Washington residents both in their construction and reduced household energy and transportation costs.</p>
<p>While creating more housing options, it is essential for cities to identify areas at higher risk of displacement and establish antidisplacement policies as required in Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 1220 (chapter 254, Laws of 2021).</p>
<p>The state has made historic investments in subsidized affordable housing through the housing trust fund, yet even with these historic investments, the magnitude of the housing shortage requires both public and private investment.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing the housing shortage, allowing more housing options in areas already served by urban infrastructure will reduce the pressure to develop natural and working lands, support key strategies for climate change, food security, and Puget Sound recovery, and save taxpayers and ratepayers money.</p>

<p>The department is directed to establish a process by which cities implementing the requirements of section 3 of this act may seek approval of alternative local action necessary to meet the requirements of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may approve actions under this section for cities that have, by January 1, 2023, adopted a comprehensive plan that is substantially similar to the requirements of this act and have adopted, or within one year of the effective date of this section adopts, permanent development regulations that are substantially similar to the requirements of this act. In determining whether a city's adopted comprehensive plan and permanent development regulations are substantially similar, the department must find as substantially similar plans and regulations that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Result in an overall increase in housing units allowed in single-family zones that is at least 75 percent of the increase in housing units allowed in single-family zones if the specific provisions of this act were adopted;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for middle housing throughout the city, rather than just in targeted locations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for additional density near major transit stops, and for projects that incorporate dedicated affordable housing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may also approve actions under this section for cities that have, by January 1, 2023, adopted a comprehensive plan or development regulations that have significantly reduced or eliminated residentially zoned areas that are predominantly single family. The department must find that a city's actions are substantially similar to the requirements of this act if they have adopted, or within one year of the effective date of this section adopts, permanent development regulations that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Result in an overall increase in housing units allowed in single-family zones that is at least 75 percent of the increase in housing units allowed in single-family zones if the specific provisions of this act were adopted;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for middle housing throughout the city, rather than just in targeted locations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow for additional density near major transit stops, and for projects that incorporate dedicated affordable housing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may determine that a comprehensive plan and development regulations that do not meet these criteria are otherwise substantially similar to the requirements of this act if the city can clearly demonstrate that the regulations adopted will allow for a greater increase in middle housing production within single family zones than would be allowed through implementation of section 3 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any local actions approved by the department pursuant to (a) of this subsection to implement the requirements under section 3 of this act are exempt from appeals under this chapter and chapter 43.21C RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department's final decision to approve or reject actions by cities implementing section 3 of this act may be appealed to the growth management hearings board by filing a petition as provided in RCW 36.70A.290.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may issue guidance for local jurisdictions to ensure that the levels of middle housing zoning under this act can be integrated with the methods used by cities to calculate zoning densities and intensities in local zoning and development regulations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any city choosing the alternative density requirements in section 3(4) of this act may apply to the department for, and the department may certify, an extension for areas at risk of displacement as determined by the antidisplacement analysis that a jurisdiction is required to complete under RCW 36.70A.070(2). The city must create a plan for implementing antidisplacement policies by their next implementation progress report required by RCW 36.70A.130(9). The department may certify one further extension based on evidence of significant ongoing displacement risk in the impacted area.</p>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The growth management hearings board shall hear and determine only those petitions alleging either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>That, except as provided otherwise by this subsection, a state agency, county, or city planning under this chapter is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, chapter 90.58 RCW as it relates to the adoption of shoreline master programs or amendments thereto, or chapter 43.21C RCW as it relates to plans, development regulations, or amendments, adopted under RCW 36.70A.040 or chapter 90.58 RCW. Nothing in this subsection authorizes the board to hear petitions alleging noncompliance with RCW 36.70A.5801;</p>

<li>
<p>That the approval of a work plan adopted under RCW 36.70A.735(1)(a) is not in compliance with the requirements of the program established under RCW 36.70A.710;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That regulations adopted under RCW 36.70A.735(1)(b) are not regionally applicable and cannot be adopted, wholly or partially, by another jurisdiction;</p>

<li>
<p>That a department certification under RCW 36.70A.735(1)(c) is erroneous; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the department's final decision to approve or reject actions by a city implementing section 3 of this act is clearly erroneous.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition may be filed only by: (a) The state, or a county or city that plans under this chapter; (b) a person who has participated orally or in writing before the county or city regarding the matter on which a review is being requested; (c) a person who is certified by the governor within sixty days of filing the request with the board; or (d) a person qualified pursuant to RCW 34.05.530.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section &quot;person&quot; means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, state agency, governmental subdivision or unit thereof, or public or private organization or entity of any character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To establish participation standing under subsection (2)(b) of this section, a person must show that his or her participation before the county or city was reasonably related to the person's issue as presented to the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When considering a possible adjustment to a growth management planning population projection prepared by the office of financial management, the board shall consider the implications of any such adjustment to the population forecast for the entire state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rationale for any adjustment that is adopted by the board must be documented and filed with the office of financial management within ten working days after adoption.</p>
<p>If adjusted by the board, a county growth management planning population projection shall only be used for the planning purposes set forth in this chapter and shall be known as the &quot;board adjusted population projection.&quot; None of these changes shall affect the official state and county population forecasts prepared by the office of financial management, which shall continue to be used for state budget and planning purposes.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Any city choosing the alternative density requirements in section 3(4) of this act may apply to the department for, and the department may certify, an extension of the implementation timelines established under section 3(11) of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An extension certified under this section may be applied only to specific areas where a city can demonstrate that water, sewer, stormwater, transportation infrastructure, including facilities and transit services, or fire protection services lack capacity to accommodate the density required in section 3 of this act, and the city has:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Included one or more improvements, as needed, within its capital facilities plan to adequately increase capacity; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identified which special district is responsible for providing the necessary infrastructure if the infrastructure is provided by a special purpose district.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an extension of the implementation timelines is requested due to lack of water supply from the city or the purveyors who serve water within the city, the department's evaluation of the extension must be based on the applicable water system plans in effect and approved by the department of health. Water system plan updates initiated after the effective date of this section must include consideration of water supply requirements for middle housing types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An extension granted under this section remains in effect until the earliest of:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The infrastructure is improved to accommodate the capacity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city's deadline to complete its next periodic comprehensive plan update under RCW 36.70A.130; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The city's deadline to complete its implementation progress report to the department as required under RCW 36.70A.130(9).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city that has received an extension under this section may reapply for any needed extension with its next periodic comprehensive plan update under RCW 36.70A.130 or its implementation progress report to the department under RCW 36.70A.130(9). The application for an additional extension must include a list of infrastructure improvements necessary to meet the capacity required in section 3 of this act. Such additional extension must only be to address infrastructure deficiency that a city is not reasonably able to address within the first extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may establish by rule any standards or procedures necessary to implement this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must provide the legislature with a list of projects identified in a city's capital facilities plan that were the basis for the extension under this section, including planning level estimates. Additionally, the city must contact special purpose districts to identify additional projects associated with extensions under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city granted an extension for a specific area must allow development as provided under section 3 of this act if the developer commits to providing the necessary water, sewer, or stormwater infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an area zoned predominantly for residential use is currently served only by private wells, group B water systems or group A water systems with less than 50 connections, or a city or water providers within the city do not have an adequate water supply or available connections to serve the zoning increase required under section 3 of this act, the city may limit the areas subject to the requirements under section 3 of this act to match current water availability. Nothing in this act affects or modifies the responsibilities of cities to plan for or provide urban governmental services as defined in RCW 36.70A.030 or affordable housing as required by RCW 36.70A.070.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No city shall approve a building permit for housing under section 3 of this act without compliance with the adequate water supply requirements of RCW 19.27.097.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an area zoned predominantly for residential use is currently served only by on-site sewage systems, development may be limited to two units per lot, until either the landowner or local government provides sewer service or demonstrates a sewer system will serve the development at the time of construction. Nothing in this act affects or modifies the responsibilities of cities to plan for or provide urban governmental services as defined in RCW 36.70A.030.</p>
