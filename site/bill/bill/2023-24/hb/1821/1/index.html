<ol>
<li>
<p>A credential transparency work group is created within the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of the credential transparency work group is to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Increase postsecondary credential transparency by improving, through a student-centered and worker-centered focus, the ability of students, workers, employers, educators, policymakers, and the general public to better understand, evaluate, and make decisions about the full range of credentials delivered or issued in, or funded or governed by, the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and disseminate valuable fields of information across credentials to support understanding, evaluation, and decision making. Such fields include, but are not limited to, credential type, time to degree, initial and potential lifetime earnings, employer demand location, modality, credential provider, and potential job and career paths;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review existing state credential platforms, data infrastructures, and projects; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify best practices to increase postsecondary credential transparency through, for example, the state board of education mastery-based learning initiative in K-12, existing programs at state institutions of higher education, licensing, registered apprenticeships, and career connected learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The credential transparency work group shall provide recommendations to, and may contract with, at least one state credential transparency platform. The work group shall consider credential transparency platforms, statutes, and policies in other states in recommending or developing the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A shared definition of credential;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common credential terminology;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes, if needed, to state credential platforms, data infrastructures, and projects to support understanding, transparency, evaluation, and decision making;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proposal to establish K-12 credential recommendations to advance the multiple graduation pathways framework enacted in 2019, and to recognize learning that occurs through paid work and career connected learning opportunities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A statewide communications plan to increase credential awareness among credential providers and potential users including, but not limited to, students, workers, employers, teachers, guidance counselors, and parents; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The continuation and scope of its work under subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The credential transparency work group shall identify up to four workforce industry sectors that have statewide reach and contribute to the state's workforce development system. Each industry shall select two of its statewide occupations to test concepts of credential transparency through demonstration projects. Each industry shall select a network of partners to fulfill the requirements of the demonstration projects.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each of the four industry sector demonstration projects must:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Identify diverse approaches to obtaining credentials across a range of providers within the chosen occupations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chart the skills, behaviors, abilities, and knowledge required for occupational pathways within the chosen occupations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect credential data within the chosen occupations, defined and determined by the work group using the common credential terminology.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The industry sectors shall report to the work group the preliminary results of the data collected under this subsection by June 1, 2024, and final results by July 1, 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent possible, the work group shall incorporate the data and information collected under (a) of this subsection into web-based tools and services, maintained and published by the board, that present information to allow users such as students, workers, employers, educators, and others to understand, evaluate, and make decisions about credentials and maximize the user's most equitable outcome.</p>
