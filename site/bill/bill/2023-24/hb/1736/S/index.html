<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the purpose of gaining more accurate information on vehicle miles traveled in the state, including by geographical region, to further state transportation planning efforts and the transportation system policy goals of preservation, safety, stewardship, mobility, economic vitality, and protection of the environment established in RCW 47.04.280, as well as to facilitate development of alternative transportation funding mechanisms, the legislature finds it necessary to collect motor vehicle mileage information through the reporting of annual odometer readings. However, the legislature does not intend for failure to provide an odometer reading to prevent the registration of a vehicle. Therefore, the legislature intends to require the department of licensing to begin requesting motor vehicle odometer mileage upon vehicle registration beginning March 1, 2024.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An owner or the owner's authorized representative must apply for an original vehicle registration to the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director on a form furnished by the department. The application must contain:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of the vehicle, including its make, model, vehicle identification number, type of body, and power to be used;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name and address of the person who is the registered owner of the vehicle and, if the vehicle is subject to a security interest, the name and address of the secured party;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose for which the vehicle is to be used;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The licensed gross weight for the vehicle, which is:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The adult seating capacity, including the operator, as provided for in RCW 46.16A.455(1) if the vehicle will be operated as a for hire vehicle or auto stage and has a seating capacity of more than six; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gross weight declared by the applicant as required in RCW 46.16A.455(2) if the vehicle will be operated as a motor truck, tractor, or truck tractor;</p>

</li>

The vehicle owner is not required to provide the mileage shown on the odometer. Failure to provide any or accurate mileage shown on the odometer is not grounds to deny vehicle registration or issue any monetary or civil penalty or infraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registered owner or the registered owner's authorized representative shall sign the application for an original vehicle registration and certify that the statements on the application are true to the best of the applicant's knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application for an original vehicle registration must be accompanied by a draft, money order, certified bank check, or cash for all fees and taxes due for the application for an original vehicle registration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever any person, after applying for or receiving a vehicle registration, moves from the address named in the application or in the registration issued to him or her, or changes his or her name of record, the person shall, within 10 days thereafter, notify the department of the name or address change as provided in RCW 46.08.195.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A registered owner or the registered owner's authorized representative must apply for a renewal vehicle registration to the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director on a form approved by the director. The application for a renewal vehicle registration must be accompanied by a draft, money order, certified bank check, or cash for all fees and taxes required by law for the application for a renewal vehicle registration. In the application for a renewal vehicle registration of a motor vehicle for on-road use, the department shall request the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor vehicle being registered at the time of application. The vehicle owner is not required to provide the mileage shown on the odometer. Failure to provide any or accurate mileage shown on the odometer is not grounds to deny vehicle registration or issue any monetary or civil penalty or infraction.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When a vehicle changes ownership, the person taking ownership or his or her authorized representative must apply for a renewal vehicle registration as provided in subsection (1) of this section and, except as provided in (b) of this subsection, pay all the taxes and fees that are due at the time of registration renewal.

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application and the fees and taxes for a renewal vehicle registration must be handled in the same manner as an original vehicle registration application.

</li>

<p>A person expecting to be out of state during the normal renewal period of a vehicle registration may renew a vehicle registration and have license plates or tabs preissued by applying for a renewal as described in subsection (1) of this section. A vehicle registration may be renewed for the subsequent registration year up to 18 months before the current expiration date and must be displayed from the date of issue or from the day of the expiration of the current registration year, whichever date is later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application for a renewal vehicle registration is not required for those vehicles owned, rented, or leased by:</p>
