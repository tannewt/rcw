<p>For the purpose of gaining more accurate information on vehicle miles traveled in the state, including by geographical region, to further state transportation planning efforts and the transportation system policy goals of preservation, safety, stewardship, mobility, economic vitality, and protection of the environment established in RCW 47.04.280, as well as to facilitate development of alternative transportation funding mechanisms, the legislature finds it necessary to collect motor vehicle mileage information through the reporting of annual odometer readings. Therefore, the legislature intends to require the department of licensing to begin collecting motor vehicle odometer mileage upon vehicle registration beginning March 1, 2024.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A registered owner or the registered owner's authorized representative must apply for a renewal vehicle registration to the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director on a form approved by the director. The application for a renewal vehicle registration must be accompanied by a draft, money order, certified bank check, or cash for all fees and taxes required by law for the application for a renewal vehicle registration, and if a motor vehicle is being registered for on-road use, must include the mileage shown on the odometer of the vehicle at the time of application.</p>

<p>When a vehicle changes ownership, the person taking ownership or his or her authorized representative must apply for a renewal vehicle registration as provided in subsection (1) of this section and, except as provided in (b) of this subsection, pay all the taxes and fees that are due at the time of registration renewal. For the purposes of this section, when a vehicle is sold to a vehicle dealer for resale, the application for a renewal registration need not be made until the vehicle is sold by the vehicle dealer.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An application and the fees and taxes for a renewal vehicle registration must be handled in the same manner as an original vehicle registration application.
