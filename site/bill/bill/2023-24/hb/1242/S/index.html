<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is an increased need for timely and affordable behavioral health services for children, youth, and adults. Planning is necessary across a broad range of policy areas including health care delivery, public health, long-term services and supports, economic and other social services, housing, workforce, both the K-12 and higher education systems, and the criminal justice system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This issue demands a reasoned and constructive discussion regarding the objectives of the state's behavioral health system, and a coordinated, coherent, actionable, and sustainable plan to achieve those objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In establishing the joint legislative executive committee on behavioral health, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure a strategic statewide approach to behavioral health services by providing a forum to conduct a systemic study of the current behavioral health landscape informed by the perspectives of individuals with actual and practical experience dealing with the behavioral health system; providing direction to the legislature in coordinating state and federal resources; and creating partnerships across complementary sectors for the development, implementation, and coordination of long-term strategies to ensure access to appropriate and affordable behavioral health care for all Washington residents.</p>
