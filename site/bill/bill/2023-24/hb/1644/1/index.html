<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the state's business and occupation tax, as a gross receipts tax, imposes significant hardships on new businesses, small businesses, and unprofitable and low profit-margin businesses. The legislature further finds that the piecemeal enactment of countless tax preferences to ameliorate these hardships has led to an exceedingly complex tax. The legislature intends to address these issues and improve Washington's economy by converting the business and occupation tax into a modified gross receipts tax to be known as the margin tax. Like the business and occupation tax, the margin tax is imposed upon virtually all business activities carried on within the state, other than those specifically exempt under the constitutions or laws of this state or of the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that this proposal, if passed, would reduce the amount distributed to tribes who have entered into compacts under chapter 132, Laws of 2020, as they are currently receiving 100 percent of business and occupation tax from retail sales taxable transactions sourced to a compacting tribe's compact covered area. With the passage of this act, it is not the intent of the legislature to reduce compacting tribes' benefits under tax revenue-sharing compacts. It is the intent of the legislature for the department of revenue to fulfill its compact obligations to discuss any changes in the compact or authorizing acts that may be appropriate to preserve the intended benefits of each compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also recognizes that the federal permanent internet tax freedom act generally prohibits state and local governments from imposing a tax on internet access but expressly excludes certain taxes from this prohibition, including Washington's business and occupation tax. The legislature does not intend by this act to exempt internet access from any tax imposed in this act. Therefore, the legislature intends for the taxes imposed in this act to be considered a modification of the business and occupation tax.</p>

<p>If the department of revenue determines that any tax or estimated tax payment due under RCW 82.32.045 has been substantially underpaid, there is assessed a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax determined by the department to be due. If payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received by the department by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof, including any estimated payment due under RCW 82.32.045 and billed to the taxpayer by the department, there is assessed a total penalty of fifteen percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection; and if payment of any tax determined by the department to be due is not received on or before the thirtieth day following the due date specified in the notice of tax due, or any extension thereof, including any estimated payment due under RCW 82.32.045 and billed to the taxpayer by the department, there is assessed a total penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax under this subsection.

The department may not impose the penalty under this subsection (4) if a taxpayer who has engaged in business taxable under this title without first having registered as required by RCW 82.32.030, prior to any notification by the department of the need to register, obtains a registration certificate from the department.</p>

<p>If the department finds that a taxpayer has disregarded specific written instructions as to reporting or tax liabilities, or willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically, as provided by RCW 82.32.080, the department must add a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax that should have been reported and/or paid electronically or the additional tax found due if there is a deficiency because of the failure to follow the instructions. A taxpayer disregards specific written instructions when the department has informed the taxpayer in writing of the taxpayer's tax obligations and the taxpayer fails to act in accordance with those instructions unless, in the case of a deficiency, the department has not issued final instructions because the matter is under appeal pursuant to this chapter or departmental regulations. The department may not assess the penalty under this section upon any taxpayer who has made a good faith effort to comply with the specific written instructions provided by the department to that taxpayer. A taxpayer will be considered to have made a good faith effort to comply with specific written instructions to file returns and/or remit taxes electronically only if the taxpayer can show good cause, as defined in RCW 82.32.080, for the failure to comply with such instructions. A taxpayer will be considered to have willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically if the department has mailed or otherwise delivered the specific written instructions to the taxpayer on at least two occasions. Specific written instructions may be given as a part of a tax assessment, audit, determination, closing agreement, or other written communication, provided that such specific written instructions apply only to the taxpayer addressed or referenced on such communication. Any specific written instructions by the department must be clearly identified as such and must inform the taxpayer that failure to follow the instructions may subject the taxpayer to the penalties imposed by this subsection. If the department determines that it is necessary to provide specific written instructions to a taxpayer that does not comply with the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically as provided in RCW 82.32.080, the specific written instructions must provide the taxpayer with a minimum of forty-five days to come into compliance with its electronic filing and/or payment obligations before the department may impose the penalty authorized in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department finds that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from engaging in a disregarded transaction, as described in RCW 82.32.655(3), the department must assess a penalty of thirty-five percent of the additional tax found to be due as a result of engaging in a transaction disregarded by the department under RCW 82.32.655(2). The penalty provided in this subsection may be assessed together with any other applicable penalties provided in this section on the same tax found to be due, except for the evasion penalty provided in subsection (7) of this section. The department may not assess the penalty under this subsection if, before the department discovers the taxpayer's use of a transaction described under RCW 82.32.655(3), the taxpayer discloses its participation in the transaction to the department.</p>

<p>If the department finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable hereunder, a further penalty of fifty percent of the additional tax found to be due must be added.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any individual registered with the self-exclusion program created under this section is prohibited from participating in gambling activities associated with this program and forfeits all moneys and things of value obtained by the individual or owed to the individual by an authorized gambling establishment as a result of prohibited wagers or gambling activities.

</li>
</ol>
<p>Moneys and things of value forfeited under the self-exclusion program must be distributed to the problem gambling account created in RCW 41.05.751 and/or a charitable or nonprofit organization that provides problem gambling services or increases awareness about problem gambling pursuant to rules adopted by the commission; and</p>
<pre><code>    iv. The commission must adopt rules establishing the self-exclusion program by June 30, 2021.

e. An individual who participates in the self-exclusion program does not have a cause of action against the state of Washington, the commission, or any gambling establishment, its employees, or officers for any acts or omissions in processing or enforcing the requirements of the self-exclusion program, including a failure to prevent an individual from gambling at an authorized gambling establishment.

f. Any personal information collected, stored, or accessed under the self-exclusion program may only be used for the administration of the self-exclusion program and may not be disseminated for any purpose other than the administration of the self-exclusion program.

<p>For purposes of this chapter and chapters 82.04 and 82.12 RCW, a marketplace facilitator is deemed to be an agent of any marketplace seller making retail sales through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning October 1, 2018, marketplace facilitators subject to a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2) must collect and remit to the department retail sales tax on all taxable retail sales made or facilitated by the marketplace facilitator, whether in its own right or as an agent of a marketplace seller, regardless of whether the marketplace seller is subject to a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2). Beginning January 1, 2020, the collection obligation of a marketplace facilitator under this chapter also applies to any other taxes and fees, as defined under RCW 82.02.260, that are imposed on a retail sale made or facilitated by the marketplace facilitator, whether in its own right or as an agent of a marketplace seller, regardless of whether the marketplace seller has a tax collection obligation under RCW 82.08.052 (1) or (2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to other applicable recordkeeping requirements, the department may require a marketplace facilitator to provide or make available to the department any information the department determines is reasonably necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter and chapter 82.13 RCW. Such information may include documentation of sales made by marketplace sellers through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace. The department may prescribe by rule the form and manner for providing this information.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2019, to ensure that marketplace sellers have the necessary information to timely and accurately file their excise tax returns with the department pursuant to RCW 82.32.045, a marketplace facilitator must, at a minimum, provide each of its marketplace sellers with access, through a written report or other means, to gross sales information for all Washington sales made as an agent of the marketplace seller under this section during the immediately preceding month. Marketplace facilitators must provide such access within fifteen calendar days following the end of each month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a marketplace seller does not receive the gross sales information for all Washington sales through a marketplace facilitator, as required under (a) of this subsection (4), the marketplace seller may determine its margin tax liability under section 202 of this act based on a reasonable method of estimating Washington sales as may be required or approved by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, &quot;Washington sales&quot; means any sale sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730, regardless of whether the sale is a retail sale.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a marketplace facilitator has fully complied with the requirements of subsection (4)(a) of this section, the marketplace facilitator is relieved of liability under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW for failure to collect the correct amount of tax to the extent that the marketplace facilitator can show to the department's satisfaction that the error was due to incorrect information given to the marketplace facilitator by the marketplace seller, unless the marketplace facilitator and marketplace seller are affiliated persons. Where the marketplace facilitator is relieved of liability under this subsection (5), the marketplace seller is solely liable for the amount of uncollected tax due.</p>

<p>Subject to the limits in (b) and (c) of this subsection (6), a marketplace facilitator that has fully complied with the requirements of subsection (4)(a) of this section is relieved of liability under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW for the failure to collect tax on taxable retail sales to the extent that the marketplace facilitator can show to the department's satisfaction that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The taxable retail sale was made through the marketplace facilitator's marketplace;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The taxable retail sale was made solely as the agent of a marketplace seller, and the marketplace facilitator and marketplace seller are not affiliated persons; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure to collect sales tax was not due to an error in sourcing the sale under RCW 82.32.730.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liability relief for a marketplace facilitator under (a) of this subsection (6) for a calendar year is limited as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>For calendar year 2018, the liability relief may not exceed ten percent of the total tax due under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW on taxable retail sales facilitated by the marketplace facilitator as agent of a marketplace seller and sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730 during the same calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For calendar year 2019, the liability relief may not exceed five percent of the total tax due under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW on taxable retail sales by the marketplace facilitator as agent of a marketplace seller and sourced to this state under RCW 82.32.730 during the same calendar year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this subsection (6) do not apply to retail sales made after December 31, 2019.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection (6), a retail sale is deemed to be facilitated by a marketplace facilitator when the marketplace facilitator either:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Accepts the order for the product;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicates to the marketplace seller the buyer's offer to purchase the product;</p>

<li>
<p>Accepts the buyer's payment for the product; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delivers or arranges for delivery of the product.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the marketplace facilitator is relieved of liability under this subsection (6), the marketplace seller is also relieved of liability for the amount of uncollected tax due, subject to the limitations in subsection (7) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may by rule determine the manner in which a taxpayer may claim the liability relief provided under this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this section, a marketplace seller obligated to collect the taxes imposed under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW is not required to collect such taxes on all taxable retail sales through a marketplace operated by a marketplace facilitator if the marketplace seller has obtained documentation from the marketplace facilitator indicating that the marketplace facilitator is registered with the department and will collect all applicable taxes due under this chapter and chapter 82.12 RCW on all taxable retail sales made on behalf of the marketplace seller through the marketplace operated by the marketplace facilitator. The documentation required by this subsection (7) must be provided in a form and manner prescribed by or acceptable to the department. This subsection (7) does not relieve a marketplace seller from liability for uncollected taxes due under this chapter or chapter 82.12 RCW resulting from a marketplace facilitator's failure to collect the proper amount of tax due when the error was due to incorrect information given to the marketplace facilitator by the marketplace seller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No class action may be brought against a marketplace facilitator in any court of this state on behalf of purchasers arising from or in any way related to an overpayment of sales or use tax collected by the marketplace facilitator, regardless of whether that claim is characterized as a tax refund claim. Nothing in this subsection affects a purchaser's right to seek a refund from the department as provided under chapter 82.32 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section affects the obligation of any purchaser to remit sales or use tax and any other applicable taxes and fees, as to any applicable taxable transaction in which the seller or the seller's agent does not collect and remit sales tax.</p>
