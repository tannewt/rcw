<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that delays in the processing of permits increases the cost of housing. The legislature also finds that Washington is in a housing crisis for all types of housing. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure predictable and consistent permit processes by creating a system of accountability, metrics, and best practices for local governments to follow when reviewing a permit application. The legislature finds that Washington's cities and counties may need assistance and resources for adopting these best practices and ensuring predictable permit timelines, so it is the intent of the legislature to provide assistance and resources for local governments to be successful in processing permits. The legislature acknowledges that permitting is necessary for the health and safety of our communities now and into the future. Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature to encourage new home construction of all types through permit process improvements, so Washington's builders can build Washington's future neighborhoods safely and more quickly.</p>
