<ol>
<li>
<p>A candidate statement submitted for inclusion in the voters' pamphlet may not contain false or misleading statements about the candidate having served in the military or the details of such service.

<li>
<p>A registered voter may initiate a committee investigation into whether a candidate statement contains a statement prohibited under subsection (1) of this section. The committee may also initiate its own investigations sua sponte.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the conclusion of its investigation, the committee shall vote to determine whether the candidate statement contains a statement prohibited under subsection (1) of this section. If a majority of the committee votes that a violation has occurred, the committee must publicly report its findings.</p>
</li>
