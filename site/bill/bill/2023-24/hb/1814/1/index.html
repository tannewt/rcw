<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that governor executive order 22-13 required nearly all state employees to be vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. This order resulted in the loss of nearly 1,900 state employees, including 400 transportation workers, which led to curtailed ferry service, reduced snowplow service, and fewer state patrol officers. The legislature further finds that vaccine requirements for state employees continue to evolve as the most recently negotiated state employee collective bargaining agreements remove the vaccine booster requirement and replace it with a $1,000 incentive payment. In light of recent and future changes to employer mandated vaccination policies, it is the intent of the legislature to facilitate the efficient return of state employees who separated from employment due to mandatory vaccination policies, by providing a hiring preference. It is also the intent of the legislature to permit these individuals, employed by both the state and local governments, to make employee contributions and receive state retirement system service credit for specified periods of work missed due to employer mandated vaccination policies.</p>

<li>
<p>In all competitive examinations, unless otherwise provided in this section, to determine the qualifications of applicants for public offices, positions, or employment, either the state, and all of its political subdivisions and all municipal corporations, or private companies or agencies contracted with by the state to give the competitive examinations shall give a scoring criteria status to individuals separated from employment due to vaccination status during the 2020, 2021, or 2022 calendar years. This preference must be implemented by adding 10 percent to the passing mark, grade or rating only, based upon a possible rating of 100 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vaccination status scoring criteria may be claimed upon submission by an applicant to a prospective employer, as listed in subsection (1) of this section, of either proof of dismissal related to vaccination status, or proof of the prior employer's vaccination policy, and an affidavit that the applicant separated from employment due to the employer policy.</p>
