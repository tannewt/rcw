<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes the findings in the 2021 state energy strategy, which reports that improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most cost-effective means to meet the state's emissions and energy goals for buildings. While there have been significant energy efficiency savings achieved in the state over the past four decades, there remains enormous potential to achieve even greater savings in existing buildings. Increasing access to energy efficiency improvements, such as weatherization measures and installation of highly efficient electric appliances, in residential and nonresidential buildings achieves many benefits including reducing energy bills, avoiding the need for new electricity generating facilities and electricity transmission, and creating living wage jobs.</p>
<p>The legislature also recognizes the 2021 state energy strategy's electrification scenario findings that the amount of fossil natural gas delivered to buildings must be reduced by 90 percent from 2020 to 2050 to meet the state's emissions limits. The electrification scenario indicates substantial near-term and long-term benefits from energy reduction measures in buildings. This points to the value of early and aggressive action to improve energy efficiency, including electrification and other efficiency measures in buildings. Implementing multiple measures simultaneously in each building and achieving a high level of market penetrations will achieve economies of scale and help lower costs of energy upgrades.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to put the state on a pathway to meeting the emissions limits as outlined in RCW 70A.45.020, the strategy recommends widespread conversion of fossil fuel end uses to electricity, to deploy more demand responsive and energy efficiency technologies, and to increase the supply of electricity from renewable energy.</p>
<p>The 2022 report to the legislature on state weatherization plus health programs recommends the state provide funding to expand the suite of weatherization and community energy efficiency program services statewide, prioritizing multifamily housing, fossil fuel-heated housing, and high energy burden communities.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that financial and technical assistance programs be expanded to direct municipal state and federal funds as well as electric and natural gas utility funding towards greater achievement of energy efficiency improvements. To this end, the legislature establishes a policy goal of providing cost-effective electrification and energy efficiency services to the state's residential and commercial buildings over the next 10 years. The legislature also intends to attain this goal in part through supporting programs for state registered apprenticeship programs and that there is a maximum living wage job creation in fields related to building energy retrofits.</p>
<p>By leveraging state resources available through the climate commitment act, the legislature intends to rapidly leverage the various funding streams created in the federal inflation reduction act and ensure that our state has projects ready and optimizes all available federal resources. Washington's approach to this work will ensure that low-income and moderate-income Washingtonians can fully benefit from federal investment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the legislature finds that improving the energy efficiency of, and reducing the greenhouse gases from, residential buildings are critical to meeting the state's adopted climate goals. The legislature finds that making information about energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions available to homebuyers will help buyers make more informed decisions and will cause the housing market to better value energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. The legislature further finds that other states have energy labeling programs in place that are both proven and effective. The legislature further finds that energy labeling is a multifaceted issue that requires collaborative effort between real estate professionals, environmental advocates, low-income housing representatives, and other involved parties to identify how labeling should be designed and implemented. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a task force with the goal of developing a method for energy labeling of residential buildings.</p>
