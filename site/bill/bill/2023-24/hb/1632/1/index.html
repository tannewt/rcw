<ol>
<li>
<p>The department of commerce shall study, directly or through a contract, the retirement preparedness of Washington residents and the feasibility of establishing a state-sponsored private retirement savings program.

The scope of the analysis shall include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An examination of potential retirement savings options for self-employed individuals, part-time employees, and full-time employees whose employers do not offer a retirement savings plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimates of the impact on the state budget and on taxpayers from shortfalls in retirement savings or income, including on public budgets from a loss of economic activity by seniors;</p>

<p>The level of interest by Washington employers in participating in a state-sponsored private retirement savings program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consultation with impacted stakeholders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An examination of the impact of retirement savings on income and wealth inequality;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The likely costs to start up a state-sponsored private retirement savings program, an estimate of the time for the program to reach self-sufficiency, and potential funding options;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experience of other states that have implemented or are implementing a state-sponsored private retirement savings program for employers and employees, as well as program impacts on the market for retirement plan products and services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An evaluation of the feasibility and benefits of interstate partnerships and cooperative agreements with similar state-sponsored private retirement savings programs established in other jurisdictions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of potential changes in enrollment in a joint state-sponsored private retirement savings program if potential participants are concurrently enrolled in the federal &quot;saver's credit&quot; program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appropriate state agency and potential structure for implementing a state-sponsored private retirement savings program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations for statutory changes or appropriations for establishing a state-sponsored private retirement savings program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of commerce, in undertaking the analysis, may convene a group of stakeholders to assist and provide insight into the feasibility and preferred structure of a state-sponsored private retirement savings program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The findings shall be provided in a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature and in accordance with RCW 43.01.036 by September 30, 2023.</p>
