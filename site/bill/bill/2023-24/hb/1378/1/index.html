<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that nearshore habitat is amongst the most important for threatened and endangered species of salmon, yet nearshore habitat in populated areas is often negatively impacted by man-made structures. There is a growing problem where aquatic or over-water structures become derelict or fall into disrepair. These derelict aquatic structures are public nuisances and safety hazards as they can pose risks to navigation, harm nearshore habitat for threatened and endangered species, detract from the aesthetics of Washington's waterfronts, and threaten the environment with the potential release of hazardous materials. The legislature further finds that the costs associated with the proper removal or repair of derelict aquatic structures are substantial, and that in many cases owners of these structures lack the financial means to address the safety and environmental hazards the structures pose. As a result, the costs associated with the removal or repair of derelict structures becomes a burden on public entities and the taxpaying public. The legislature also finds that removal of derelict aquatic structures and restoration of surrounding habitat improves nearshore habitat quality.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>An authorized public entity has the authority, subject to the processes and limitations of this chapter, to remove, salvage, scrap, or dispose of a derelict aquatic structure found on or above aquatic lands within the jurisdiction of the authorized public entity. Any removal and disposal must be done in an environmentally sound manner and in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws, including the state solid waste disposal provisions provided for in chapter 70A.205 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary responsibility to remove a derelict aquatic structure belongs to the owner or lessee of the structure, and secondarily to the authorized public entity with jurisdiction over the aquatic lands on which the structure lies. If the authorized public entity with the secondary responsibility is unwilling or unable to exercise the authority granted by this section, it may request the department to assume the authorized public entity's authority for a particular structure. The department may at its discretion assume the authorized public entity's authority for a particular structure after being requested to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority granted by this chapter is permissive, and no authorized public entity has a duty to exercise the authority. No liability attaches to an authorized public entity that chooses not to exercise this authority. An authorized public entity, in the good faith performance of the actions authorized under this chapter, is not liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in the performance of the actions other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. Any person whose assistance has been requested by an authorized public entity, who has entered into a written agreement pursuant to section 9 of this act, and who, in good faith, renders assistance or advice with respect to activities conducted by an authorized public entity pursuant to this chapter, is not liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in the rendering of the assistance or advice, other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.</p>

<li>
<p>Prior to exercising the authority granted in section 3 of this act, the authorized public entity must first obtain possession of the structure. To do so, the authorized public entity must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Mail notice of its intent to obtain possession, at least 20 days prior to taking possession, to the last known address of the previous owner and to any lienholders or secured interests on record. A notice need not be sent to the purported owner or any other person whose interest in the structure is not recorded with a state or local jurisdiction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post notice of its intent clearly on the structure for 30 days and publish its intent at least once, more than 10 days but less than 20 days prior to taking possession, in a newspaper of general circulation for the county in which the structure is located; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post notice of its intent on the department's internet website on a page specifically designated for such notices. If the authorized public entity is not the department, the department must facilitate the internet posting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All notices sent, posted, or published in accordance with this section must, at a minimum, contain a description of the structure sufficient for identification, a statement of the reason or reasons why the structure has been posted, and explain the intent of the authorized public entity to take possession of the structure, the rights of the authorized public entity after taking possession of the structure as provided in section 3 of this act, the procedures the owner must follow in order to avoid possession being taken by the authorized public entity, the procedures the owner must follow in order to reclaim possession after possession is taken by the authorized public entity, and the financial liabilities that the owner may incur as provided for in section 8 of this act.</p>

<p>Any authorized public entity may take temporary possession of a structure if the owner of the structure cannot be located or is unwilling or unable to assume immediate responsibility for the structure and if the structure:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Is in immediate danger of collapse, breaking up, or blocking navigational channels; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poses a reasonably imminent threat to human health or safety, including a threat of environmental contamination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before taking temporary possession of the structure, the authorized public entity must make reasonable attempts to consult with the department to ensure that other remedies are not available. The basis for taking temporary possession of the structure must be set out in writing by the authorized public entity within seven days of taking action and be submitted to the owner, if known, as soon thereafter as is reasonable. If the authorized public entity has not already provided the required notice, immediately after taking possession of the structure, the authorized public entity must initiate the notice provisions in subsection (1) of this section. The authorized public entity must complete the notice requirements of subsection (1) of this section before using or disposing of the structure as authorized in section 5 of this act.</p>

<p>The derelict structure removal account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from and those moneys specified must be deposited into the account. The account is authorized to receive fund transfers and appropriations from the general fund, deposits from the derelict structure removal surcharge, as well as gifts, grants, and endowments from public or private sources as may be made from time to time, in trust or otherwise, for the use and benefit of the purposes of this chapter and expend the same or any income according to the terms of the gifts, grants, or endowments provided those terms do not conflict with any provisions of this section or any guidelines developed to prioritize reimbursement of removal projects associated with this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moneys in the account may only be spent after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may only be used by the department to reimburse authorized public entities for up to 90 percent of the total reasonable and auditable administrative, removal, disposal, and environmental damage costs of derelict aquatic structures when the previous owner is either unknown after a reasonable search effort or insolvent. Reimbursement may not be made unless the department determines that the authorized public entity has made reasonable efforts to identify and locate the party responsible for the structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funds in the account resulting from transfers from the general fund should be prioritized for the removal of large structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In each biennium, up to 20 percent of the expenditures from the account may be used for administrative expenses of the department of licensing and department of natural resources in implementing this chapter.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Priority for use of this account is for the removal of derelict structures that are in danger of collapsing, breaking up, or blocking navigation channels, or that present environmental risks or significant habitat impacts. The department must develop criteria, in the form of informal guidelines, to prioritize removal projects associated with this chapter, but may not consider whether the applicant is a state or local entity when prioritizing. The guidelines must also include guidance to the authorized public entities as to what removal activities and associated costs are reasonable and eligible for reimbursement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must keep all authorized public entities apprised of the balance of the account and the funds available for reimbursement. The guidelines developed by the department must also be made available to the other authorized public entities. This subsection must be satisfied by utilizing the least costly method, including maintaining the information on the department's internet website, or any other cost-effective method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An authorized public entity may contribute its 10 percent of costs that are not eligible for reimbursement by using in-kind services, including the use of existing staff, equipment, and volunteers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter does not guarantee reimbursement for an authorized public entity. Authorized public entities seeking certainty in reimbursement prior to taking action under this chapter may first notify the department of their proposed action and the estimated total costs. Upon notification by an authorized public entity, the department must make the authorized public entity aware of the status of the account and the likelihood of reimbursement being available. The department may offer technical assistance and assure reimbursement for up to two years following the removal action if an assurance is appropriate given the balance of the account and the details of the proposed action.</p>
