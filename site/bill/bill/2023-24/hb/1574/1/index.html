<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington's crop and livestock farms offer some of the most cost-effective, readily available opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to help achieve the state's pollution reduction goals.</p>
<p>Examples include development of anaerobic digesters, which reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing methane from organic waste to produce renewable natural gas and electricity and recover nutrients for biofertilizers that displace synthetic fertilizers produced using fossil natural gas or mined in distant locations. Recovered fiber can be used to produce biochar to enhance soil structure, retain water and nutrients, and provide long-term carbon sequestration. Alternative manure and agriculture waste management practices can reduce greenhouse gas emissions on smaller farms while providing organic compost that can replace synthetic fertilizers, improve soil health, and sequester carbon. These practices also improve water and air quality.</p>
<p>Expanding this program supports implementation of the department of ecology's use food well Washington plan for food waste reduction, the department of commerce's latest state energy strategy, and the findings of the department of commerce's rural clean energy advisory committee. It also supports and helps coordinate the agricultural community's involvement in achieving the goals of greenhouse gas emissions policies under the climate commitment act, clean fuels program, organic materials management act, and healthy homes and clean buildings act.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to appropriate funds through the state conservation commission's sustainable farms and fields program that support these practices on crop and livestock farms while supporting research that leads to new, innovative approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, creating renewable energy, and marketable by-products.</p>

<pre><code>d. Purchase of seed, seedlings, spores, animal feed, and amendments;

e. Services to agricultural producers, such as the development of site-specific conservation plans, providing financial assistance to implement best management practices that increase carbon sequestration in soil organic matter levels and standing vegetation, reduce livestock and soil greenhouse gas emissions, or to increase soil organic levels or to increase usage of precision agricultural practices, or design and implementation of best management practices to reduce livestock emissions;

f. The purchase of compost spreading equipment, or financial assistance to farmers to purchase compost spreading equipment, for the annual use for at least three years of volumes of compost determined by the commission to be significant from materials composted at a site that is not owned or operated by the farmer;

g. Scientific studies to evaluate and quantify the greenhouse gas emissions avoided as a result of using crop residues as a biofuel feedstock or to identify management practices that increase the greenhouse gas emissions avoided as a result of using crop residues as a biofuel feedstock;
