<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Trust in government communications regarding drugs and medical devices is critical to public safety, and trust is built upon accurate information that is void of conflicts of interest and the perception of conflicts of interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic brought to light inconsistencies between the communication requirements of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act including emergency use authorization and communications promulgated by government offices and agencies regarding drugs and medical devices made available in Washington. Inconsistent communications have eroded public trust of government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government agencies purchase, store, distribute, promote, and mandate various drug and medical device products. Because of their ability to reach all consumers through various means, government agencies often have greater influence on consumer decisions than do the product manufacturers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real or perceived conflicts of interest exist when government agencies or their employees are members of organizations that collaborate with or are directly or indirectly sponsored by drug and product manufacturers for which products the government is responsible for creating or implementing policy; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only the federal government has the authority to enforce the food, drug, and cosmetic act. When the federal government does not enforce federal laws, Washington consumers are exposed to communications that jeopardize critical consumer protections and undermine trust in public health.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to protect consumers and rebuild trust in public health by preventing certain conflicts of interest, and by requiring government agencies in Washington to adhere to state consumer protection laws and federal labeling and advertising laws that apply to drug and medical device manufacturers and their products.</p>
</li>
</ol>
