<li>
<p>By July 1, 2024, the department must, through the contractor under subsection (2) of this section, establish the domestic violence lethality hotline to provide an evidence-based standard of practice to prevent intimate partner homicide, increase victim safety, and enhance collaboration between law enforcement, domestic violence agencies, and service providers across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must contract with an organization to operate the hotline. The department must select the organization through a competitive bidding process and ensure that the selected organization has demonstrated financial stability, meets the qualifications for the duties identified in this section, and does not have any conflicts of interest that would interfere with the duties identified in this section. The department may adopt rules for carrying out this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The hotline must develop or select a lethality assessment instrument and protocol to be used to determine the likelihood that a homicide will be committed by one intimate partner against another. The lethality determination may not be based exclusively on a numeric score, but must be based on a comprehensive picture of the situation and the professional determination of the person conducting the assessment. All lethality assessments must be rooted in evidence-based risk factors for domestic homicide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2025, the hotline must provide on-call service for completing lethality assessments remotely through victim interviews facilitated by peace officers under RCW 10.99.030 and for petitioners in domestic violence protection order proceedings. The hotline must also assist victims with immediate safety planning. Upon completing a lethality assessment, the hotline must electronically transmit a copy of the assessment to the applicable local law enforcement agency or court. Services under this subsection must be offered statewide, on-demand, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hotline must establish policies and procedures for conducting lethality assessments, and develop and provide training to peace officers on best practices for coordinating with the hotline, as required under RCW 10.99.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognizing that past history of domestic violence is a significant lethality factor, law enforcement agencies and the courts must provide the hotline access to criminal history records and court records to the extent necessary for the hotline to perform lethality assessments under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hotline must implement a mechanism to place a high lethality designation in law enforcement and court databases if a respondent or defendant is determined to be at high risk of intimate partner homicide under this section.</p>
</li>

<p>When service is to be completed under this chapter by a law enforcement officer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The clerk of the court shall have a copy of any order issued under this chapter, the confidential information form, as well as the petition for a protection order and any supporting materials, electronically forwarded on the same judicial day to the law enforcement agency in the county or municipality where the respondent resides, as specified in the order, for service upon the respondent. If the respondent has moved from that county or municipality and personal service is not required, the law enforcement agency specified in the order may serve the order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service of an order issued under this chapter must take precedence over the service of other documents by law enforcement unless they are of a similar emergency nature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where personal service is required, the first attempt at service must occur within 24 hours of receiving the order from the court unless an emergency situation renders the service infeasible. The law enforcement officer must give priority to orders with a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act. If the first attempt is not successful, no fewer than two additional attempts should be made to serve the order, particularly for respondents who present heightened risk of lethality or other risk of physical harm to the petitioner or petitioner's family or household members. All attempts at service must be documented on a proof of service form and submitted to the court in a timely manner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The law enforcement officer serving an order under this section must attempt to contact the petitioner before the attempted service so that the petitioner may provide pertinent information related to officer safety considerations, the respondent's behavior, the location and description of the respondent's firearms, and other relevant details;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If service cannot be completed within 10 calendar days, the law enforcement officer shall notify the petitioner. The petitioner shall provide information sufficient to permit notification. Law enforcement shall continue to attempt to complete service unless otherwise directed by the court. In the event that the petitioner does not provide a service address for the respondent or there is evidence that the respondent is evading service, the law enforcement officer shall use law enforcement databases to assist in locating the respondent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the respondent is in a protected person's presence at the time of contact for service, the law enforcement officer should take reasonable steps to separate the parties when possible prior to completing the service or inquiring about or collecting firearms. When the order requires the respondent to vacate the parties' shared residence, law enforcement shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the respondent has left the premises and is on notice that his or her return is a violation of the terms of the order. The law enforcement officer shall provide the respondent with copies of all forms with the exception of the confidential information form completed by the protected party and the proof of service form;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any law enforcement officer who serves a protection order on a respondent with the knowledge that the respondent requires special assistance due to a disability, brain injury, or impairment shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of the respondent to the extent practicable without compromise to the safety of the petitioner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of service must be submitted to the court on the proof of service form. The form must include the date and time of service and each document that was served in order for the service to be complete, along with any details such as conduct at the time of service, threats, or avoidance of service, as well as statements regarding possession of firearms, including any denials of ownership despite positive purchase history, active concealed pistol license, or sworn statements in the petition that allege the respondent's access to, or possession of, firearms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon service of the order, the law enforcement officer must contact the petitioner to communicate that the order has been served, is now in effect, and can be lawfully enforced. The officer must also convey to the petitioner information regarding the respondent's behavior that may be relevant to the petitioner's safety planning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If attempts at service were not successful, the proof of service form or the form letter showing that the order was not served, and stating the reason it was not served, must be returned to the court by the next judicial day following the last unsuccessful attempt at service. Each attempt at service must be noted and reflected in computer aided dispatch records, with the date, time, address, and reason service was not completed; or</p>

<p>This section applies to modification or termination of domestic violence protection orders, sexual assault protection orders, stalking protection orders, and antiharassment protection orders.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon a motion with notice to all parties and after a hearing, the court may modify the terms of an existing protection order or terminate an existing order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A respondent's motion to modify or terminate an existing protection order must include a declaration setting forth facts supporting the requested order for modification or termination. The nonmoving parties to the proceeding may file opposing declarations. All motions to modify or terminate shall be based on the written materials and evidence submitted to the court. The court shall set a hearing only if the court finds that adequate cause is established. If the court finds that the respondent established adequate cause, the court shall set a date for hearing the respondent's motion, which must be at least 14 days from the date the court finds adequate cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the motion of a respondent, the court may not modify or terminate an existing protection order unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a substantial change in circumstances such that the respondent will not resume, engage in, or attempt to engage in, the following acts against the petitioner or those persons protected by the protection order if the order is terminated or modified:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Acts of domestic violence, in cases involving domestic violence protection orders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical or nonphysical contact, in cases involving sexual assault protection orders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acts of stalking, in cases involving stalking protection orders; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acts of unlawful harassment, in cases involving antiharassment protection orders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The petitioner bears no burden of proving that he or she has a current reasonable fear of harm by the respondent.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may consider the following unweighted factors, and no inference is to be drawn from the order in which the factors are listed:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has committed or threatened sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, or other harmful acts against the petitioner or any other person since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has violated the terms of the protection order and the time that has passed since the entry of the order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has exhibited suicidal ideation or attempts since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has been convicted of criminal activity since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has either acknowledged responsibility for acts of sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, or behavior that resulted in the entry of the protection order, or successfully completed state-certified perpetrator treatment or counseling since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has a continuing involvement with drug or alcohol abuse, if such abuse was a factor in the protection order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the petitioner consents to terminating the protection order, provided that consent is given voluntarily and knowingly; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors relating to a substantial change in circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may not base its determination on the fact that time has passed without a violation of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of whether there is a substantial change in circumstances, the court may decline to terminate a protection order if it finds that the acts of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, unlawful harassment, and other harmful acts that resulted in the issuance of the protection order were of such severity that the order should not be terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A respondent may file a motion to modify or terminate an order no more than once in every 12-month period that the order is in effect, starting from the date of the order and continuing through any renewal period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person who is protected by a protection order has a child or adopts a child after a protection order has been issued, but before the protection order has expired, the petitioner may seek to include the new child in the order of protection on an ex parte basis if the child is already in the physical custody of the petitioner. If the restrained person is the legal or biological parent of the child, a hearing must be set and notice given to the restrained person prior to final modification of the full protection order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court must require the respondent to pay the petitioner for costs incurred in responding to a motion to modify or terminate a domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking protection order, including reasonable attorneys' fees. A court may require the respondent to pay the petitioner for costs incurred in responding to a motion to modify or terminate any other type of protection order, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="section-406">Section 406 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-406">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In any proceeding in which the court enters a temporary protection order that includes a temporary order to surrender and prohibit weapons, and after the hearing the court denies the petition for a full protection order, the court must stay entry of the decision and provide notice to the petitioner of the right to seek reconsideration or revision of the decision in accordance with this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court must notify the petitioner verbally and provide the petitioner with written information at the hearing in which the court denies the petition for a full protection order explaining the procedures and timelines for filing a motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision. The information must also include contact information for civil legal aid organizations that may assist the petitioner with a motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A motion for reconsideration or a motion for revision must be filed within 10 calendar days of the court's denial of the petition for a full protection order. The petitioner may not file both a motion for reconsideration and a motion for revision. The hearing on the motion must be held within 30 calendar days from the filing of the motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court's order denying entry of a full protection order must be stayed, and the temporary protection order and temporary order to surrender and prohibit weapons must remain in effect, pending reconsideration or revision, as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the petitioner does not timely file a motion for reconsideration or motion for revision, the order denying the full protection order becomes final once the filing deadline for a motion for reconsideration or motion for revision has passed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the petitioner timely files a motion for reconsideration or motion for revision, the stay of the court's order denying the full protection order remains in place until the hearing on the motion for reconsideration or motion for revision is held, but no later than 30 calendar days after the motion is filed.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the commission must provide ongoing specialized, intensive, and integrative training for persons responsible for investigating domestic violence cases involving intimate partners. The training must be based on a victim-centered, trauma-informed approach to responding to domestic violence. Among other subjects, the training must include content on the neurobiology of trauma and trauma-informed interviewing, counseling, and investigative techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training must: Be based on research-based practices and standards; offer participants an opportunity to practice interview skills and receive feedback from instructors; minimize the trauma of all persons who are interviewed during investigations; provide methods of reducing the number of investigative interviews necessary whenever possible; assure, to the extent possible, that investigative interviews are thorough, objective, and complete; recognize needs of special populations; recognize the nature and consequences of domestic violence victimization; require investigative interviews to be conducted in a manner most likely to permit the interviewed persons the maximum emotional comfort under the circumstances; address record retention and retrieval; address documentation of investigative interviews; and educate investigators on the best practices for notifying victims of significant events in the investigative process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the training, the commission must seek advice from the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, organizations representing victims of domestic violence, and experts on domestic violence and the neurobiology of trauma. The commission must consult with the Washington association of prosecuting attorneys in an effort to design training containing consistent elements for all professionals engaged in interviewing and interacting with domestic violence victims in the criminal legal system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must develop the training and begin offering it by January 1, 2025. Officers assigned to regularly investigate domestic violence must complete the training within one year of being assigned or by July 1, 2026, whichever is later.</p>
