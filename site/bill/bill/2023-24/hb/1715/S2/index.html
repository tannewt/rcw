<ol>
<li>
<p>By January 1, 2025, the department must, through the contractor under subsection (2) of this section, establish the domestic violence lethality hotline to provide an evidence-based standard of practice to prevent intimate partner homicide, increase victim safety, prevent children from being exposed to violence and support children who have been exposed to violence, and enhance collaboration among law enforcement, domestic violence agencies, and service providers across the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must contract with an organization to operate the hotline. The department must select the organization through a competitive bidding process and ensure that the selected organization has demonstrated financial stability, meets the qualifications for the duties identified in this section, and does not have any conflicts of interest that would interfere with the duties identified in this section. The department may adopt rules for carrying out this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The organization must develop or select a lethality assessment instrument and protocol to be used to determine the likelihood that a homicide will be committed by one intimate partner against another. The lethality determination may not be based exclusively on a numeric score, but must be based on a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the professional determination of the person conducting the assessment. All lethality assessments must be rooted in evidence-based risk factors for domestic homicide. The lethality assessment instrument and protocol must be empirically validated and reassessed at regular intervals to ensure its accuracy and that the results are not racially biased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2025, the hotline must provide on-call service for completing lethality assessments remotely through victim interviews facilitated by peace officers under RCW 10.99.030 and for petitioners in domestic violence protection order proceedings. The hotline must also assist victims with confidential immediate safety planning and referrals for children exposed to violence. Upon completing a lethality assessment, the hotline must transmit a copy of the assessment to the applicable local law enforcement agency or court unless the victim objects to such transmission. Services under this subsection must be offered statewide, on-demand, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organization must establish policies and procedures for conducting lethality assessments, and develop and provide training to peace officers on best practices for coordinating with the hotline, as required under RCW 10.99.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognizing that past history of domestic violence is a significant lethality factor, law enforcement agencies and the courts must provide the hotline access to criminal history records and court records to the extent necessary for the hotline to perform lethality assessments under this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The organization must implement a mechanism to place a high lethality designation in law enforcement and court databases if a respondent or defendant is determined to be at high risk of intimate partner homicide under this section, including the Washington state patrol's electronic database accessible to law enforcement agencies and officers, including federally recognized Indian tribes, that have a connection to the Washington state patrol database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The administrative office of the courts shall develop a standard form to submit the designation to the courts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organization shall, in consultation with stakeholders, determine appropriate training requirements for individuals conducting lethality assessments. The training must be competency-based, include a practical application, and include material on domestic violence, domestic violence homicide prevention, and trauma-informed interviewing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the lethality assessment is complete, the hotline must provide the victim with immediate safety planning based on the assessment. The hotline staff conducting the lethality assessment may not be the same staff assisting the victim with immediate safety planning. The hotline staff responsible for immediate safety planning must inform the victim of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The level of danger based on the assessment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the victim has the right to object to the lethality assessment being shared with law enforcement or the courts and the potential safety implications based on that decision;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the victim chooses to share the assessment with the courts and law enforcement, the individuals and entities with whom the assessment will be shared, how it will be used in court, safety measures that may be ordered as a result of the assessment, and the extent to which the assessment will be shared with the subject of the assessment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the victim does not choose to share the assessment with the courts and law enforcement, that the victim has the right to make a different decision at a later time and how to exercise that change of decision;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the assessment is exempt from public disclosure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the assessment is confidential unless the victim chooses to share it and that safety planning is confidential under all circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After conducting immediate safety planning, the hotline must refer the victim to a local community-based domestic violence agency for follow-up. When practicable, the referral must be conducted in a manner that directly connects the victim to the agency in real time, as opposed to only providing contact information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hotline shall provide, upon request, a copy of the lethality assessment to a prosecutor or an attorney representing the subject of the assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Department&quot; means the department of social and health services; and</p>

<li>
<p>The administrative office of the courts must develop a model form for courts to use when granting protection orders or no-contact orders when the respondent or defendant has a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act. The form must include all mandatory conditions for protection orders or no-contact orders with a high lethality designation.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes the importance of connecting domestic violence survivors with civil legal counsel. To support this effort for survivors seeking private attorneys for representation, the office of civil legal aid shall contract with a statewide domestic violence survivor advocacy organization to maintain on its website a statewide list of attorneys who represent survivors of domestic violence in protection order proceedings. The list of attorneys must be organized by region of the state and include contact information for the attorneys. An initial list shall be posted by July 1, 2024, and be regularly updated thereafter.</p>

<p>The legislature recognizes that many tribes exercise tribal court civil jurisdiction in domestic violence matters. While principles of tribal sovereignty and commitments made in the centennial accord prohibit the state of Washington from directing tribal court practices or directing that counsel be appointed in tribal court civil protection proceedings, and while the provisions of chapter 7.105 RCW do not apply in tribal courts, it is necessary that indigenous survivors of domestic violence have access to high quality legal assistance in tribal court domestic violence protection proceedings consistent with applicable tribal court rules and practices. To this end, and subject to appropriations for this purpose, the office of civil legal aid must develop a program and implementation plan to provide indigenous-informed, culturally competent legal support for survivors in tribal court domestic violence protection proceedings. The office of civil legal aid must establish a tribal advisory council to inform and guide the development of this program. Initial operation of the tribal court civil protection proceedings program must commence by January 1, 2025.</p>

<p>The legislature hereby respectfully requests the Washington supreme court's gender and justice commission to convene a work group of interested collaborators and professional experts to establish minimum practice and training standards for attorneys representing survivors of domestic violence in protection orders under chapter 7.105 RCW. The work group is also requested to review currently available training for nonlawyers assisting survivors in proceedings under chapter 7.105 RCW and to suggest improvements, additions, and appropriate practice standards. The commission is requested to adopt and forward final standards to the appropriate legislative committees by November 30, 2024.</p>

<p>When service is to be completed under this chapter by a law enforcement officer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The clerk of the court shall have a copy of any order issued under this chapter, the confidential information form, as well as the petition for a protection order and any supporting materials, electronically forwarded on the same judicial day to the law enforcement agency in the county or municipality where the respondent resides, as specified in the order, for service upon the respondent. If the respondent has moved from that county or municipality and personal service is not required, the law enforcement agency specified in the order may serve the order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service of an order issued under this chapter must take precedence over the service of other documents by law enforcement unless they are of a similar emergency nature;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where personal service is required, the first attempt at service must occur within 24 hours of receiving the order from the court unless an emergency situation renders the service infeasible. The law enforcement officer must give priority to orders with a high lethality designation under section 101 of this act. If the first attempt is not successful, no fewer than two additional attempts should be made to serve the order, particularly for respondents who present heightened risk of lethality or other risk of physical harm to the petitioner or petitioner's family or household members. All attempts at service must be documented on a proof of service form and submitted to the court in a timely manner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The law enforcement officer serving an order under this section must attempt to contact the petitioner before the attempted service so that the petitioner may provide pertinent information related to officer safety considerations, the respondent's behavior, the location and description of the respondent's firearms, and other relevant details;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If service cannot be completed within 10 calendar days, the law enforcement officer shall notify the petitioner. The petitioner shall provide information sufficient to permit notification. Law enforcement shall continue to attempt to complete service unless otherwise directed by the court. In the event that the petitioner does not provide a service address for the respondent or there is evidence that the respondent is evading service, the law enforcement officer shall use law enforcement databases to assist in locating the respondent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the respondent is in a protected person's presence at the time of contact for service, the law enforcement officer should take reasonable steps to separate the parties when possible prior to completing the service or inquiring about or collecting firearms. When the order requires the respondent to vacate the parties' shared residence, law enforcement shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the respondent has left the premises and is on notice that the respondent's return is a violation of the terms of the order. The law enforcement officer shall provide the respondent with copies of all forms with the exception of the confidential information form completed by the protected party and the proof of service form;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any law enforcement officer who serves a protection order on a respondent with the knowledge that the respondent requires special assistance due to a disability, brain injury, or impairment shall make a reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of the respondent to the extent practicable without compromise to the safety of the petitioner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof of service must be submitted to the court on the proof of service form. The form must include the date and time of service and each document that was served in order for the service to be complete, along with any details such as conduct at the time of service, threats, or avoidance of service, as well as statements regarding possession of firearms, including any denials of ownership despite positive purchase history, active concealed pistol license, or sworn statements in the petition that allege the respondent's access to, or possession of, firearms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon service of the order, the law enforcement officer must contact the petitioner to communicate that the order has been served, is now in effect, and can be lawfully enforced. The officer must also convey to the petitioner information regarding the respondent's behavior that may be relevant to the petitioner's safety planning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If attempts at service were not successful, the proof of service form or the form letter showing that the order was not served, and stating the reason it was not served, must be returned to the court by the next judicial day following the last unsuccessful attempt at service. Each attempt at service must be noted and reflected in computer aided dispatch records, with the date, time, address, and reason service was not completed; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The law enforcement information sheet may not include the petitioner's residential address.</p>

<p>To help ensure familiarity with the unique nature of protection order proceedings, and an understanding of trauma-informed practices and best practices in the use of new technologies for remote hearings, judicial officers, including persons who serve as judicial officers pro tempore, should receive evidence-based training on procedural justice, trauma-informed practices, gender-based violence dynamics, coercive control, elder abuse, juvenile sex offending, teen dating violence, domestic violence homicide prevention, and requirements and best practices for the surrender of weapons before presiding over protection order hearings. Trainings should be provided on an ongoing basis as best practices, research on trauma, and legislation continue to evolve.

<li>
<p>Upon a motion with notice to all parties and after a hearing, the court may modify the terms of an existing protection order or terminate an existing order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A respondent's motion to modify or terminate an existing protection order must include a declaration setting forth facts supporting the requested order for modification or termination. The nonmoving parties to the proceeding may file opposing declarations. All motions to modify or terminate shall be based on the written materials and evidence submitted to the court. The court shall set a hearing only if the court finds that adequate cause is established. If the court finds that the respondent established adequate cause, the court shall set a date for hearing the respondent's motion, which must be at least 14 days from the date the court finds adequate cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the motion of a respondent, the court may not modify or terminate an existing protection order unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a substantial change in circumstances such that the respondent will not resume, engage in, or attempt to engage in, the following acts against the petitioner or those persons protected by the protection order if the order is terminated or modified:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Acts of domestic violence, in cases involving domestic violence protection orders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical or nonphysical contact, in cases involving sexual assault protection orders;</p>

<li>
<p>Acts of stalking, in cases involving stalking protection orders; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acts of unlawful harassment, in cases involving antiharassment protection orders.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>The petitioner bears no burden of proving that the petitioner has a current reasonable fear of harm by the respondent.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may consider the following unweighted factors, and no inference is to be drawn from the order in which the factors are listed:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has committed or threatened sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, or other harmful acts against the petitioner or any other person since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has violated the terms of the protection order and the time that has passed since the entry of the order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has exhibited suicidal ideation or attempts since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has been convicted of criminal activity since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has either acknowledged responsibility for acts of sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, or behavior that resulted in the entry of the protection order, or successfully completed state-certified perpetrator treatment or counseling since the protection order was entered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the respondent has a continuing involvement with drug or alcohol abuse, if such abuse was a factor in the protection order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the petitioner consents to terminating the protection order, provided that consent is given voluntarily and knowingly; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other factors relating to a substantial change in circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances, the court may not base its determination on the fact that time has passed without a violation of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of whether there is a substantial change in circumstances, the court may decline to terminate a protection order if it finds that the acts of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, unlawful harassment, and other harmful acts that resulted in the issuance of the protection order were of such severity that the order should not be terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A respondent may file a motion to modify or terminate an order no more than once in every 12-month period that the order is in effect, starting from the date of the order and continuing through any renewal period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person who is protected by a protection order has a child or adopts a child after a protection order has been issued, but before the protection order has expired, the petitioner may seek to include the new child in the order of protection on an ex parte basis if the child is already in the physical custody of the petitioner. If the restrained person is the legal or biological parent of the child, a hearing must be set and notice given to the restrained person prior to final modification of the full protection order.</p>

<li>
<p>(a)(i) Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, a court must require the respondent to pay the petitioner for costs incurred in responding to a motion to modify or terminate a domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking protection order, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>
<pre><code> ii. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that an order to pay costs would be manifestly unjust or that the respondent is currently unable to pay the costs and is unlikely to be able to pay the costs in the future, the court may set the costs at a lower amount, enter into a payment plan with the respondent, or decline to order payment of the costs.

<p>Because of the heightened risk of lethality to petitioners when respondents to protection orders become aware of court involvement and continue to have access to firearms, and the frequency of noncompliance with court orders prohibiting possession of firearms, law enforcement and judicial processes must emphasize swift and certain compliance with court orders prohibiting access, possession, and ownership of all firearms.</p>

<p>A law enforcement officer serving a protection order, no-contact order, or restraining order that includes an order to surrender all firearms, dangerous weapons, and a concealed pistol license under RCW 9.41.800 shall inform the respondent that the order is effective upon service and the respondent must immediately surrender all firearms and dangerous weapons in the respondent's custody, control, or possession and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW 9.41.070, and conduct any search permitted by law for such firearms, dangerous weapons, and concealed pistol license. The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license belonging to the respondent that are surrendered, in plain sight, or discovered pursuant to a lawful search. If the order is entered in open court and the respondent appears in person, the respondent shall be provided a copy and further service is not required.

Nothing in this subsection affects the court's discretion to enter such an order in any other circumstances.</p>

<p>The firearm or dangerous weapon is removed from the respondent's access, custody, control, or possession and the lawful owner agrees by written document signed under penalty of perjury to store the firearm or dangerous weapon in a manner such that the respondent does not have access to or control of the firearm or dangerous weapon;</p>
