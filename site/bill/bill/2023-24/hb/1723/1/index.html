</li>
<li>
<p>Best practices must emphasize and provide resources to support the participation of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, including community-based organizations, and with special consideration for people with limited English proficiency, low incomes, and other barriers to participation. Procedures should also support the voluntary collaboration and coordination with any federally recognized Indian tribe that has entered into a memorandum of agreement pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040 and whose reservation or ceded lands lie within the county or city.</p>
