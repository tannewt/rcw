<p>This section does not prohibit price differences in goods or services based specifically upon any of the following:</p>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>If a court finds that the defendant has violated this section, an injunction may be issued by the court enjoining or restraining any violation, without requiring proof that any person has, in fact, been injured or damaged thereby. The court may require the defendant to make direct restitution, if applicable. In connection with the proposed application for an injunction, the attorney general is authorized to conduct an investigation under this chapter and make a determination of the relevant facts in support of a petition for an injunction.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Every defendant who violates section 1 of this act shall pay a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for the first violation, and a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each subsequent violation. The total civil penalty imposed shall not exceed $100,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, a court may impose additional civil penalties upon a defendant exceeding $100,000 if the person subsequently violates this section with respect to the same goods for which the maximum civil penalty has been previously imposed under a separate civil action or for any good for which the attorney general has not brought civil action pursuant to this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each instance of charging a different price for two goods that are substantially similar, as specified in section 1(4) of this act shall constitute a single violation.</p>

<li>
<p>By December 1, 2022, and every five years thereafter, the office of the attorney general shall evaluate the efficacy of the maximum civil penalty amounts established in this section in deterring violations of the consumer protection act and the difference, if any, between the current penalty amounts and the penalty amounts adjusted for inflation, and provide the legislature with a report of its findings and any recommendations in compliance with RCW 43.01.036.</p>
