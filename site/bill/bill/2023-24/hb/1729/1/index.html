<li>
<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2, 3, and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 2, 3, and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, improve industry competitiveness, and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a), (b), and (c).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage hydrogen fuel product research, development, manufacture, and sale in Washington to advance hydrogen fuel product technology, production, and adoption in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a review finds that the number of businesses in this state focused on hydrogen fuel product research, development, manufacture, or sale has increased as measured by the number of businesses claiming the tax preferences in this act, or that Washington businesses focused on hydrogen fuel product research, development, and manufacturing in the state have made advancements in hydrogen fuel product technology, then the legislature intends to extend the expiration date of these tax preferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may access and use any relevant data collected by the state.</p>

<p>In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed for each person for qualified hydrogen fuel product development. For a person who is a manufacturer or processor for hire of hydrogen fuel products, credit may be earned for expenditures occurring after January 1, 2024.</p>
