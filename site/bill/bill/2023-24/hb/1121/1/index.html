The court shall consider the age of the child, the potential harm to the child from an abduction, the legal and practical difficulties of returning the child to the jurisdiction if abducted, and the reasons for the potential abduction, including evidence of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>In an abduction prevention order, the court may impose conditions on the exercise of custody or visitation that:</p>

<li>
<p>Require the respondent to obtain education on the potentially harmful effects to the child from abduction.</p>

<p>Issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child under section 9 of this act or other laws of this state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct the use of law enforcement to take any action reasonably necessary to locate the child, obtain return of the child, or enforce a child custody determination under this chapter or other laws of this state; or</p>

<p>Grant any other relief allowed under the law of this state other than this chapter.</p>

<p>The remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and do not affect the availability of other remedies to prevent abduction.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a petition under this chapter contains allegations, and the court finds that there is a credible risk that the child is imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue an ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The respondent on a petition under subsection (1) of this section must be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later than the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ex parte warrant under subsection (1) of this section to take physical custody of a child must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible risk of imminent wrongful removal of the child is based;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the date and time for the hearing on the petition; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending further order of the court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining the placement of the child after the warrant is executed, the court may order a search of the relevant databases of the national crime information center system and similar state databases to determine if either the petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petition and warrant must be served on the respondent when or immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, is enforceable throughout this state. If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under subsection (1) of this section for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the respondent reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter does not affect the availability of relief allowed under other laws of this state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-10">Section 10 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10">¶</a></h2>
