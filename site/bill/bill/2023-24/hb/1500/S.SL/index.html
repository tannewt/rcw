<p>(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the annual gross sales of cottage food products may not exceed $35,000.

<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>Every four years, the department shall review the cap on annual gross sales established in (a) of this subsection and increase the cap by expedited rule making, in accordance with RCW 34.05.353, based on that year's average consumer price index for the Seattle, Washington area for urban wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the bureau of labor statistics, United States department of labor.</li>
</ol>

<p>If gross sales exceed the maximum allowable annual gross sales amount established under subsection (1) of this section, the cottage food operation must either obtain a food processing plant license under chapter 69.07 RCW or cease operations.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>All cottage food operations permitted under this section must include a signed document attesting, by opting to become permitted, that the permitted cottage food operation expressly grants to the director the right to enter the domestic residence housing the cottage food operation during normal business hours, or at other reasonable times, for the purposes of inspections under this chapter.</p>
