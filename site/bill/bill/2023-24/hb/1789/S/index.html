<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the trust land performance assessment, completed pursuant to section 7015, chapter 298, Laws of 2018, recommends exploring opportunities to diversify funding streams for revenue generation, including utilizing carbon markets, as well as other ways to monetize ecosystem services for the beneficiaries and the state. The legislature further finds that the climate commitment act, which established a cap and invest program under chapter 70A.65 RCW, makes Washington state a leader in climate policy and, through the codification of carbon offset projects, creates a new way for revenue to be generated from lands and waters in the state. The legislature intends that the carbon offset projects established for this program benefit the people of Washington by being located on Washington lands and waters to the extent possible, rather than outside the state. To accomplish this, the department seeks the authority to sell carbon offset credits directly under the rules of the Washington state cap and invest program. Accordingly, the legislature intends to provide the department the necessary authority to create carbon offset projects under the cap and invest program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that as the manager of nearly 6,000,000 acres of lands and waters, the department is well-suited to take actions that increase carbon sequestration and storage, generate revenue from those actions through carbon offset projects, and provide additional benefits including reforestation, forest health restoration, afforestation, air and water purification, habitat creation, temperature regulation, stormwater management, and disaster mitigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the department manages approximately 3,000,000 acres of state lands and state forestlands for various trusts that provide significant revenues for beneficiaries. The revenues derived from trust lands are critical for the trust beneficiaries to provide services, and those revenues should be maintained and increased over time, while acknowledging fluctuating market dynamics in all businesses. The trust lands managed by the department produce revenue through various means, including agriculture uses and commercial timber harvest, that provide additional societal benefits for residents, such as access to local food products, and forest products that store carbon in the built environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust lands managed by the department for agricultural and timber harvest also provide jobs and direct, indirect, and induced economic benefits, especially for rural communities. The loss of agricultural and forestlands is a major obstacle in the continued survival, competitiveness, and economic contribution of Washington state's agricultural-based and forest-based industries, and therefore the local and rural economies they support. Additionally, maintaining agricultural lands and healthy managed forests is critical to maintaining infrastructure to ensure continued agricultural and timber production in Washington state and the carbon benefits these lands provide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that private industry is leading the way by entering carbon markets and that the department should have similar authority as private industry to enter carbon markets and payment for ecosystem service projects on state lands to generate revenue and reduce costs for beneficiaries and the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, the legislature finds that by granting the department direct authority to enter payment for ecosystem service markets on public lands, including through contracts with payment for ecosystem service project developers or brokers, the department will be able to create additional revenue streams to complement existing traditional revenue streams thereby reducing costs for beneficiaries and the state. Opportunities include projects in which the department would be able to generate revenue through the reforestation of certain postwildfire areas that otherwise would not have been replanted. These areas will regenerate more quickly and robustly than had they not been replanted, which will result in more revenue for beneficiaries from future harvests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that forest health treatments that increase the resilience of Washington forests to wildfire may be eligible for carbon offset projects, thus creating a new source of funding for those treatments, reducing the costs to the state or beneficiaries by generating new revenue sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that areas that have been transferred out of trust status into natural areas or natural resource conservation areas may be eligible for carbon offset projects or other payment for ecosystem service projects, which would create a new revenue stream from lands that otherwise would not generate revenue and that the department currently incurs a cost to maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature additionally finds that the department could acquire working forestlands at risk of conversion and generate revenue for beneficiaries and for the state both through carbon offset projects having prevented the forestland from likely converting to nonforestland, and additionally through future harvests on those acquired forestlands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that similar opportunities exist in aquatic lands for kelp and eelgrass conservation and restoration projects that reduce conservation and restoration costs to the state and help to generate revenue for the aquatic lands enhancement account that funds salmon habitat improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature intends to establish the direct authority for the department to generate revenue on its lands and waters through payment for ecosystem service projects, including through contracts with payment for ecosystem service project developers or brokers, while clearly establishing and maintaining the oversight authority of the board of natural resources, and the trust beneficiaries through their representatives on the board of natural resources, for all contracts for ecosystem services on state trust lands. This includes, but is not limited to, carbon offset projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the intent of this act that the department consider the development and marketing of carbon offset projects and associated ecosystem services as added value opportunities on state trust lands and that such projects are not to be used to replace agricultural, commercial timber harvest, and other revenue-producing activities on state trust lands. At no time is the sustainable harvest to be reduced or replaced on state forestlands in favor of carbon offset or payment for ecosystem service projects without the consent of the beneficiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the intent of this act that carbon offset or ecosystem service projects implemented by the department on state trust lands result in no net decrease of agricultural production for agricultural lands and no net decrease in the decadal sustainable harvest volume and operable forestland acres on state lands and state forestlands within the sustainable harvest unit, and that they result in a net increase in future sustainable harvest volume on forested state trust lands within the sustainable harvest unit.</p>

<li>
<p>The department is authorized to enter into contracts for payment for ecosystem service projects on public lands on terms and conditions acceptable to the department and approved by the board of natural resources for the purpose of generating additional revenue by providing ecosystem services that directly or indirectly benefit humans or enhance social welfare. Any ecosystem service projects on state lands and state forestlands for which the department enters into a contract must result in no net decrease in agricultural production for agricultural lands and no net decrease in the decadal sustainable harvest volume and operable forestland acres on state lands and state forestlands within the sustainable harvest unit. Ecosystem service projects must also result in a net increase in future sustainable harvest volume on forested state trust lands within the sustainable harvest unit.

The contract term may last for a period of up to 125 years. Proceeds from contracts for ecosystem services must be deposited into the appropriate account in the state treasury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may enter into payment for ecosystem service projects on all public lands managed by the department, as long as the projects are consistent with the department's ability to manage the public lands for agriculture and commercial timber harvest and ensure the department meets its fiduciary responsibility to the state's trust beneficiaries. Ecosystem service projects must not prevent the department from managing state lands and state forestlands for sustained yield as required by RCW 79.10.310, impede the setting of the sustainable harvest level as required by RCW 79.10.320, prevent the department from harvesting timber to achieve the sustainable harvest level, result in a net decrease in agricultural production, or result in a net decrease in the decadal sustainable harvest volume and operable forestland acres on state lands and state forestlands within the sustainable harvest unit. Any ecosystem service projects proposed on state forestlands that may limit the department's ability to manage state forestlands for agriculture, commercial timber harvest, or other uses that generate revenue for beneficiaries, may only be entered into with the consent of the affected beneficiaries.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Before entering into the sale of ecosystem service credits under this chapter, the board must approve contract terms and a minimum payment for ecosystem services that is valid for a period of 180 days, or a longer period as may be established by resolution. The board must find that ecosystem service projects on state lands and state forestlands or agricultural lands will result in no net decrease in agricultural production and no net decrease in the decadal sustainable harvest volume on state lands and state forestlands in the sustainable harvest unit where the projects are located. The board must find that ecosystem service projects overall result in a net increase in future sustainable harvest volume in those sustainable harvest units where the projects are located. The board must also find that the contract will increase the revenue to beneficiaries relative to the revenue that would have been generated on that parcel over the contract term in the absence of the payment for ecosystem service project. The board may reestablish the minimum payment at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the board has set a minimum payment for ecosystem service credits, the department may set the final payment for ecosystem service credits, which must be based on current market prices.</p>
