<ol>
<li>
<p>Establishing the state designated 988 crisis contact center hubs and enhancing the crisis response system will require collaborative work between the department and the authority within their respective roles. The department shall have primary responsibility for establishing and designating the designated 988 crisis contact center hubs. The authority shall have primary responsibility for developing and implementing the crisis response system and services to support the work of the designated 988 crisis contact center hubs. In any instance in which one agency is identified as the lead, the expectation is that agency will be communicating and collaborating with the other to ensure seamless, continuous, and effective service delivery within the statewide crisis response system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall provide adequate funding for the state's crisis call centers to meet an expected increase in the use of the call centers based on the implementation of the 988 crisis hotline. The funding level shall be established at a level anticipated to achieve an in-state call response rate of at least 90 percent by July 22, 2022. The funding level shall be determined by considering standards and cost per call predictions provided by the administrator of the national suicide prevention lifeline, call volume predictions, guidance on crisis call center performance metrics, and necessary technology upgrades.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To be designated as a designated 988 crisis contact center hub, the applicant must demonstrate to the department the ability to comply with the requirements of this section and to contract to provide designated 988 crisis contact center hub services. The department may revoke the designation of any designated 988 crisis contact center hub that fails to substantially comply with the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contracts entered shall require designated 988 crisis contact center hubs to:</p>
<ol type="i">

To establish information-sharing guidelines that fulfill the intent of this section the authority shall consider input from the confidential information compliance and coordination subcommittee established under RCW 71.24.892;</p>
<pre><code>b. The means to request deployment of appropriate crisis response services, which may include mobile rapid response crisis teams, co-responder teams, designated crisis responders, fire department mobile integrated health teams, or community assistance referral and educational services programs under RCW 35.21.930, according to best practice guidelines established by the authority, and track local response through global positioning technology;

</li>
<li>
<p>Capabilities for transporting an individual experiencing a significant behavioral health emergency to a location providing appropriate level crisis stabilization services, as determined by regional transportation procedures, such as crisis receiving centers, crisis stabilization units, and triage facilities.
