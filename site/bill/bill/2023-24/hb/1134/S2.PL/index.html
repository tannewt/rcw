<p>By April 1, 2024, the authority shall establish standards for issuing an endorsement to any mobile rapid response crisis team or community-based crisis team that meets the criteria under either subsection (2) or (3) of this section, as applicable. The endorsement is a voluntary credential that a mobile rapid response crisis team or community-based crisis team may obtain to signify that it maintains the capacity to respond to persons who are experiencing a significant behavioral health emergency requiring an urgent, in-person response. The attainment of an endorsement allows the mobile rapid response crisis team or community-based crisis team to become eligible for performance payments as provided in subsection (10) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority's standards for issuing an endorsement to a mobile rapid response crisis team or a community-based crisis team must consider:</p>

<li>
<p>The authority shall contract with the actuaries responsible for development of medicaid managed care rates to conduct an analysis and develop options for payment mechanisms and levels for rate enhancements under subsection (10) of this section. The authority shall consult with staff from the office of financial management and the fiscal committees of the legislature in conducting this analysis. The payment mechanisms must be developed to maximize leverage of allowable federal medicaid match.
