<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that students with access to school library information and technology programs staffed by qualified teacher-librarians have improved school and life outcomes, including academic achievement, graduation rates, and readiness for career and college. These programs and staff are critical in supporting the equitable and successful use of educational technology, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, school districts with robust programs and qualified staff were better able to respond to the remote learning needs of teachers, students, and families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes, however, that not all students have access to these programs or staff. Despite continued support from the legislature, students in many areas of the state do not have access to school library information and technology programs staffed by qualified teacher-librarians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of access to these programs and staff disproportionately impact low-income families and families of color. Furthermore, findings show that access to high-quality school libraries is one of the most significant factors in closing the literacy gap for students experiencing poverty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, the increase in internet misinformation and disinformation necessitates instruction for all students in information literacy, digital citizenship, and media literacy by a qualified teacher-librarian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature, therefore, intends to support and strengthen access to high-quality school library information and technology programs with qualified teacher-librarians for all students and staff while acknowledging the value of having school district directors determine how to effectively implement the programs for their schools.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
