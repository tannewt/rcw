<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall establish a grant program to provide funding to educational service districts for employing teacher-librarians assigned to partner with school districts for providing services, resources, and instruction to students and staff in support of student mastery of the state learning requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In awarding grants under this section, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall prioritize applicant educational service districts that, as evidenced by applicable statewide data, have the fewest teacher-librarians, either per student or per school, within their jurisdictional boundaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An educational service district that receives a grant under this section remains eligible for receiving a grant in subsequent award cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;teacher-librarian&quot; has the same meaning as in RCW 28A.320.240.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall adopt and revise as necessary rules for the implementation of this section.</p>
