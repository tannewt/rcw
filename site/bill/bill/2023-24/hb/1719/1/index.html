<p>Local authorities are encouraged to establish a process for private transportation providers, described under subsections (1) and (3) of this section, to apply for the use of limited access facilities that are reserved for the exclusive or preferential use of public transportation vehicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process must provide a list of facilities that the local authority determines to be unavailable for use by the private transportation provider and must provide the criteria used to reach that determination.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The imposition of tolls for express toll lanes on Interstate 405 between Interstate 5 on the north end in the city of Lynnwood and Interstate 5 on the south end in the city of Tukwila, and for state route number 167 between Interstate 405 on the north end and state route number 512 on the south end is authorized. Interstate 405 and state route number 167 are designated an eligible toll facility, and toll revenue generated in the corridor must only be expended on the Interstate 405 and state route number 167 projects as identified in each corridor's master plan and as allowed under RCW 47.56.820.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tolls for the express toll lanes must be set as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The schedule of toll rates must be set by the tolling authority pursuant to RCW 47.56.850. Toll rates may vary in amount by time of day, level of traffic congestion within the highway facility, or other criteria, as the tolling authority deems appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<p>ii.(A) From June 1, 2023, until December 1, 2023, toll charges may not be assessed in the express toll lanes except between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) The department must provide a report to the transportation committees of the legislature by January 1, 2024, regarding limiting the hours of operation of the express toll lanes as required in (a)(ii)(A) of this subsection. The report must include, but is not limited to, the effect of this limitation on Interstate 405 on:</p>
<p>(I) The express toll lanes maintaining speeds of 45 miles per hour at least 90 percent of the time during peak periods;</p>
<p>(II) The average traffic speed in the general purpose lanes;</p>
<p>(III) Transit ridership;</p>
<p>(IV) The express toll lanes generating sufficient revenue to pay for all express toll lane-related operating costs; and</p>
<p>(V) Travel times and volumes on adjacent local streets and state highways.</p>
<pre><code>b. In those locations with two express toll lanes in each direction, the toll rate must be the same in both lanes.

c. Toll charges may not be assessed on transit buses and vanpools.

d. The department shall establish performance standards for travel time, speed, and reliability for the express toll lanes project. The department must automatically adjust the toll rate within the schedule established by the tolling authority, using dynamic tolling, to maintain the goal that average vehicle speeds in the lanes remain above 45 miles per hour at least 90 percent of the time during peak hours.

e. The tolling authority shall periodically review the toll rates against traffic performance of all lanes to determine if the toll rates are effectively maintaining travel time, speed, and reliability on the highway facilities.

f. [Empty]

    i. Toll charges may not be assessed on carpools with two or more people in the vehicle on the portion of Interstate 405 between Bellevue and state route number 167 for at least the first year following the initial imposition of tolls on that portion of the express toll lanes, contingent upon the analysis described in (f)(ii) of this subsection.

    ii. The department must analyze the effect of (f)(i) of this subsection utilizing forecasting and modeling data and present the results of the analysis to the tolling authority. If the analysis indicates that the express toll lanes on the portion of Interstate 405 between Bellevue and state route number 167 will not cover the financial obligations outlined in RCW 47.56.884(4), then the restriction on toll charges in (f)(i) of this subsection will not be implemented and the department must provide the transportation committees of the legislature with a report, within 30 days, that provides options for not assessing toll charges on carpools with two or more people in the vehicle, which also meet the financial obligations outlined in RCW 47.56.884(4).

g. After the bonds issued pursuant to RCW 47.10.896(1)(a) are retired, the tolling authority must reduce the toll rates commensurate with this reduction in the amount of toll revenues required from the express toll lanes.

<li>
<p>The department shall monitor the express toll lanes and shall annually report to the transportation commission and the legislature on the impacts from the project on the following performance measures:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the express toll lanes maintain speeds of 45 miles per hour at least 90 percent of the time during peak periods, and any alternate metric determined by the department in conjunction with the federal highway administration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the average traffic speed changed in the general purpose lanes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether transit ridership changed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the actual use of the express toll lanes is consistent with the projected use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the express toll lanes generated sufficient revenue to pay for all express toll lane-related operating costs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether travel times and volumes have increased or decreased on adjacent local streets and state highways.</p>
