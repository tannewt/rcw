<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to provide a voluntary option for cities and counties planning to incorporate salmon recovery into their planning under the growth management act. The legislature intends to do this in a way that provides for meaningful and measurable improvement in the protection and enhancement of habitat for anadromous fish. The legislature intends to do this without increasing the liability of cities and counties and their taxpayers, and in a way that encourages rather than discourages the voluntary participation of private landowners in projects that will improve habitat in a watershed.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If a city or county chooses to adopt an optional salmon recovery element within its comprehensive plan pursuant to RCW 36.70A.080, the salmon recovery element must comply with this section and sections 4 through 8 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of an optional salmon recovery element, a county or city must develop a work plan that is designed to result in an improvement in anadromous fish habitat. The work plan may address, among other elements, in-water and upland habitats, vegetation, water quantity, water quality, and other natural features within the county or city that contribute to anadromous fish habitat on a watershed basis, including applicable elements of salmon recovery plans adopted pursuant to the federal endangered species act. The work plan must include goals and benchmarks for the protection and enhancement of the natural features within the county or city that contribute to anadromous fish habitat on a watershed basis. In developing and implementing the work plan, the county or city must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Review and incorporate applicable water quality, watershed management, and species recovery data and plans, including the applicable elements of salmon recovery plans adopted pursuant to the endangered species act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek input from tribes, agencies, and stakeholders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop goals for participation by landowners in the county or city necessary to meet the protection and enhancement benchmarks of the work plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure outreach and technical assistance is provided to landowners in the county or city;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create measurable benchmarks that, within 10 years after the receipt of funding, are designed to result in the protection and enhancement of the functions and values of the natural features that contribute to anadromous fish habitat on a watershed basis through voluntary, incentive-based measures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designate the entity or entities that will provide technical assistance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with the entity providing technical assistance to ensure that individual stewardship plans contribute to the goals and benchmarks of the work plan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate into the work plan any existing development regulations relied upon to achieve the goals and benchmarks for protection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish baseline monitoring for: (i) Participation activities and implementation of the voluntary salmon recovery plans and projects; (ii) stewardship activities; and (iii) existing environmental conditions related to the functions and values of the natural features that contribute to anadromous fish habitat on a watershed basis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct periodic evaluations, institute adaptive management, and provide a written report of the status of plans and accomplishments to the department of fish and wildlife within 60 days after the end of each biennium; and</p>

<li>
<p>Assist state agencies in their monitoring programs.</p>

<li>
<p>If the county or city determines the protection and enhancement goals and benchmarks have not been met, it must propose and submit to the department of fish and wildlife an adaptive management plan to achieve the goals and benchmarks that were not met. The adaptive management plan must identify what additional voluntary actions are needed to meet the benchmarks and must identify the funding necessary to implement these actions.
