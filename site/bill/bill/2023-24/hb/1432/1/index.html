<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The goal of the juvenile justice system should be to protect public safety by providing meaningful opportunity for rehabilitation. Outstanding legal financial obligations represent a significant obstacle for youth and emerging adults trying to rebuild their lives after involvement with the juvenile justice system. The consequences of legal financial obligations for youth impact their ability to access education, find and keep work, and to remain stably housed – all key indicators of success and statistically important factors in reducing recidivism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite significant reforms, thousands of youth impacted by the juvenile justice system are struggling to pay legal financial obligations and other costs, and very few harmed parties receive the restitution ordered by juvenile courts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decades of research in Washington and around the country has found that legal financial obligations fall disproportionately on black, indigenous, low-income, and rural communities and communities of color. These disproportionate harms are unacceptable in any context, but especially well documented in juvenile court. Legal financial obligations are also expensive to collect, an unstable source of government revenue, and undermine trust in courts that may seem to operate as tax collectors. Because juveniles do not have the means to pay, only a small percentage of juvenile restitution is collected and in turn, harmed parties rarely see any compensation. Making people whole should be a guiding principle of any juvenile court system, while acknowledging that society bears some responsibility for harm done by individual young people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminating juvenile legal financial obligations and creating a community compensation program will better serve harmed parties, increase racial and socioeconomic equity in Washington, improve public safety, and help to support young people and families involved in the juvenile system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds and declares that the purpose of this act is to improve public safety by decreasing barriers to successful reentry and rehabilitation amongst youth previously involved in the juvenile justice system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>No fine, administrative fee, cost, surcharge, or restitution may be imposed or collected by the court or any agent of the court against any juvenile or a juvenile's parent or guardian, or other person having custody of the juvenile, in connection with any juvenile offender proceeding including, but not limited to, fees for diversion, DNA sampling, or victims' penalty assessments. Parties harmed by juveniles may collect compensation through the community compensation program as provided in section 4 of this act.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On or before the effective date of this section, the administrative office of the courts, courts of limited jurisdiction and their clerks, shall ensure that any fine, fee, cost, surcharge, or restitution previously imposed against juveniles and family members by the juvenile court is considered null and void, and uncollectible. The administrative office of the courts shall notify juveniles and families about any waived debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or before July 1, 2023, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the administrative office of the courts shall report to the relevant committees of the legislature the numbers of orders vacated or partially vacated pursuant to this section in each judicial district and the amount of the balances vacated in each judicial district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On or before July 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, the administrative office of the courts shall in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, report to the relevant committees of the legislature the total amount assessed to and collected from individuals charged in superior court and other courts of limited jurisdiction, in fees, court costs, fines, and restitution. This annual report shall include information about total amounts assessed and collected, disaggregated by the defendants' age, race, gender, legal financial obligation type, and charging court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A community compensation task force is established within the department of labor and industries. The purpose of the task force is to address the elimination of juvenile restitution required by section 2 of this act and the compensation of parties harmed by juveniles. Core considerations for the task force should be reliant on restorative principles and best practices. The task force shall hold its first meeting on or before July 1, 2023. A final implementation plan must be submitted on or before July 1, 2024, to the appropriate committees of the legislature. The final implementation plan must be published and must include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A description of the decision-making structure recommended by the task force;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Details on the infrastructure of the community compensation program created in this section to compensate parties harmed by juveniles including, but not limited to, how the program shall operate within the department of labor and industries, and an estimate of the administrative cost required to maintain the program including the salaries of any necessary staff;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A process for harmed parties, potentially including those who do not meet the current statutory definition of &quot;victim,&quot; to participate in the community compensation program, including details of the application and disbursement process, which must:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Ensure individuals may participate in the compensation program regardless of their legal status;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guarantee, to the greatest extent possible, the anonymity of those participating in the compensation program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not require a court order for harmed parties to participate in the compensation program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit, to the greatest extent possible, the amount of documentation required to participate in the program and the administrative burden on individuals seeking payment;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider capping amounts and types of costs that are eligible for compensation; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>
<p>Consider critically the ability of government entities, corporations, insurance companies, and other nonindividual harmed parties to participate in the compensation program with individual harmed parties having priority access;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A process for determining the eligibility of parties who may try to participate in the program. It is the intention of the legislature that the community compensation program be accessible to the broadest possible number of harmed parties, and that participation in the program does not require an adjudication or an order from the court; and</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>After July 23, 1989, a party who obtains a judgment or order of a court or an administrative order entered as defined in RCW 74.20A.020(6) for accrued child support, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may have an execution, garnishment, or other legal process issued upon that judgment or order at any time within 10 years of the 18th birthday of the youngest child named in the order for whom support is ordered.</p>

<p>After June 9, 1994, a party in whose favor a judgment has been filed as a foreign judgment or rendered pursuant to subsection (1) or (4) of this section, or the assignee or the current holder thereof, may, within 90 days before the expiration of the original 10-year period, apply to the court that rendered the judgment or to the court where the judgment was filed as a foreign judgment for an order granting an additional 10 years during which an execution, garnishment, or other legal process may be issued. If a district court judgment of this state is transcribed to a superior court of this state, the original district court judgment shall not be extended and any petition under this section to extend the judgment that has been transcribed to superior court shall be filed in the superior court within 90 days before the expiration of the 10-year period of the date the transcript of the district court judgment was filed in the superior court of this state. The petitioner shall pay to the court a filing fee equal to the filing fee for filing the first or initial paper in a civil action in the court, except in the case of district court judgments transcribed to superior court, where the filing fee shall be the fee for filing the first or initial paper in a civil action in the superior court where the judgment was transcribed. The order granting the application shall contain an updated judgment summary as provided in RCW 4.64.030. The filing fee required under this subsection shall be included in the judgment summary and shall be a recoverable cost.

<li>
<p>The perfection of any judgment lien and the priority of that judgment lien on property as established by RCW 6.13.090 and chapter 4.56 RCW is not altered by the extension of the judgment pursuant to the provisions of this section and the lien remains in full force and effect and does not have to be rerecorded after it is extended. Continued perfection of a judgment that has been transcribed to other counties and perfected in those counties may be accomplished after extension of the judgment by filing with the clerk of the other counties where the judgment has been filed either a certified copy of the order extending the judgment or a certified copy of the docket of the matter where the judgment was extended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as ordered in RCW 4.16.020 (2) or (3), chapter 9.94A RCW, or chapter 13.40 RCW, no judgment is enforceable for a period exceeding 20 years from the date of entry in the originating court.

<ol>
<li>
<p>When any adult is found guilty in any superior court of having committed a crime, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, there shall be imposed by the court upon such convicted person a penalty assessment. The assessment shall be in addition to any other penalty or fine imposed by law and shall be five hundred dollars for each case or cause of action that includes one or more convictions of a felony or gross misdemeanor and two hundred fifty dollars for any case or cause of action that includes convictions of only one or more misdemeanors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The assessment imposed by subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to motor vehicle crimes defined in Title 46 RCW except those defined in the following sections: RCW 46.61.520, 46.61.522, 46.61.024, 46.52.090, 46.70.140, 46.61.502, 46.61.504, 46.52.101, 46.20.410, 46.52.020, 46.10.495, 46.09.480, 46.61.5249, 46.61.525, 46.61.685, 46.61.530, 46.61.500, 46.61.015, 46.52.010, 46.44.180, 46.10.490(2), and 46.09.470(2).</p>

<p>When any adult accused of having committed a crime posts bail in superior court pursuant to the provisions of chapter 10.19 RCW and such bail is forfeited, there shall be deducted from the proceeds of such forfeited bail a penalty assessment, in addition to any other penalty or fine imposed by law, equal to the assessment which would be applicable under subsection (1) of this section if the person had been convicted of the crime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such penalty assessments shall be paid by the clerk of the superior court to the county treasurer. Each county shall deposit one hundred percent of the money it receives per case or cause of action under subsection (1) of this section, not less than one and seventy-five one-hundredths percent of the remaining money it retains under RCW 10.82.070 and the money it retains under chapter 3.62 RCW, and all money it receives under subsection (7) of this section into a fund maintained exclusively for the support of comprehensive programs to encourage and facilitate testimony by the victims of crimes and witnesses to crimes. A program shall be considered &quot;comprehensive&quot; only after approval of the department upon application by the county prosecuting attorney. The department shall approve as comprehensive only programs which:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide comprehensive services to victims and witnesses of all types of crime with particular emphasis on serious crimes against persons and property. It is the intent of the legislature to make funds available only to programs which do not restrict services to victims or witnesses of a particular type or types of crime and that such funds supplement, not supplant, existing local funding levels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are administered by the county prosecuting attorney either directly through the prosecuting attorney's office or by contract between the county and agencies providing services to victims of crime;</p>

<li>
<p>Assist victims of violent crimes in the preparation and presentation of their claims to the department of labor and industries under this chapter.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before a program in any county west of the Cascade mountains is submitted to the department for approval, it shall be submitted for review and comment to each city within the county with a population of more than one hundred fifty thousand. The department will consider if the county's proposed comprehensive plan meets the needs of crime victims in cases adjudicated in municipal, district or superior courts and of crime victims located within the city and county.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Upon submission to the department of a letter of intent to adopt a comprehensive program, the prosecuting attorney shall retain the money deposited by the county under subsection (4) of this section until such time as the county prosecuting attorney has obtained approval of a program from the department. Approval of the comprehensive plan by the department must be obtained within one year of the date of the letter of intent to adopt a comprehensive program. The county prosecuting attorney shall not make any expenditures from the money deposited under subsection (4) of this section until approval of a comprehensive plan by the department. If a county prosecuting attorney has failed to obtain approval of a program from the department under subsection (4) of this section or failed to obtain approval of a comprehensive program within one year after submission of a letter of intent under this section, the county treasurer shall monthly transmit one hundred percent of the money deposited by the county under subsection (4) of this section to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>County prosecuting attorneys are responsible to make every reasonable effort to insure that the penalty assessments of this chapter are imposed and collected.</p>

<p>Every city and town shall transmit monthly one and seventy-five one-hundredths percent of all money, other than money received for parking infractions, retained under RCW 3.50.100 and 35.20.220 to the county treasurer for deposit as provided in subsection (4) of this section.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Any payment of benefits to or on behalf of a victim under this chapter creates a debt due and owing to the department by any person found to have committed the criminal act in either a civil or criminal court proceeding in which he or she is a party. If there has been a superior or district court order, or an order of the indeterminate sentence review board or the department of social and health services, as provided in subsection (4) of this section, the debt shall be limited to the amount provided for in the order. A court order shall prevail over any other order. If, in a criminal proceeding, a person has been found to have committed the criminal act that results in the payment of benefits to a victim and the court in the criminal proceeding does not enter a restitution order, the department shall, within one year of imposition of the sentence, petition the court for entry of a restitution order.</p>

<p>If a person served a notice of debt due and owing fails to respond within thirty days, the department may seek a default judgment. Upon entry of a judgment in an action brought pursuant to (a) of this subsection, the clerk shall enter the order in the execution docket. The filing fee shall be added to the amount of the debt indicated in the judgment. The judgment shall become a lien upon all real and personal property of the person named in the judgment as in other civil cases.

For purposes of this subsection, &quot;person or organization&quot; includes any individual, firm, association, corporation, political subdivision of the state, or agency of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order to withhold and deliver must be served in the manner prescribed for the service of a summons in a civil action or by certified mail, return receipt requested.

<li>
<p>If there is in the possession of the person or organization served with the order any property that might be subject to the claim of the department, the person or organization must immediately withhold such property and deliver the property to the director or the director's authorized representative immediately upon demand.</p>

<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the court may require a defendant to pay costs. Costs may be imposed only upon a convicted adult defendant, except for costs imposed upon an adult defendant's entry into a deferred prosecution program, costs imposed upon an adult defendant for pretrial supervision, or costs imposed upon an adult defendant for preparing and serving a warrant for failure to appear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs shall be limited to expenses specially incurred by the state in prosecuting the defendant or in administering the deferred prosecution program under chapter 10.05 RCW or pretrial supervision. They cannot include expenses inherent in providing a constitutionally guaranteed jury trial or expenditures in connection with the maintenance and operation of government agencies that must be made by the public irrespective of specific violations of law. Expenses incurred for serving of warrants for failure to appear and jury fees under RCW 10.46.190 may be included in costs the court may require a defendant to pay. Costs for administering a deferred prosecution may not exceed $250. Costs for administering a pretrial supervision other than a pretrial electronic alcohol monitoring program, drug monitoring program, or 24/7 sobriety program may not exceed $150. Costs for preparing and serving a warrant for failure to appear may not exceed $100. Costs of incarceration imposed on a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor or a gross misdemeanor may not exceed the actual cost of incarceration. In no case may the court require the offender to pay more than $100 per day for the cost of incarceration. Payment of other court-ordered financial obligations, including all legal financial obligations and costs of supervision take precedence over the payment of the cost of incarceration ordered by the court. All funds received from defendants for the cost of incarceration in the county or city jail must be remitted for criminal justice purposes to the county or city that is responsible for the defendant's jail costs. Costs imposed constitute a judgment against a defendant and survive a dismissal of the underlying action against the defendant. However, if the defendant is acquitted on the underlying action, the costs for preparing and serving a warrant for failure to appear do not survive the acquittal, and the judgment that such costs would otherwise constitute shall be vacated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall not order a defendant to pay costs if the defendant at the time of sentencing is indigent. In determining the amount and method of payment of costs for defendants who are not indigent, the court shall take account of the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose. For the purposes of this section, a defendant is &quot;indigent&quot; if the defendant: (a) Meets the criteria defined in RCW 10.101.010(3) (a) through (c); (b) is homeless or mentally ill as defined in RCW 71.24.025; (c) has household income above 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines and has recurring basic living costs, as defined in RCW 10.101.010, that render the defendant without the financial ability to pay;  (d) was a minor at the time the crime occurred; or (e) has other compelling circumstances that exist that demonstrate an inability to pay.</p>
</li>

<p>A defendant who has been ordered to pay costs and who has not willfully failed to pay the obligation, as described in RCW 9.94A.6333, 9.94B.040, and 10.01.180, may at any time petition the sentencing court for remission of the payment of costs or of any unpaid portion thereof. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may remit all or part of the amount due in costs, modify the method of payment under RCW 10.01.170, or convert the unpaid costs to community restitution hours, if the jurisdiction operates a community restitution program, at the rate of no less than the state minimum wage established in RCW 49.46.020 for each hour of community restitution.

<p>RECOMMENDED PROSECUTING STANDARDS</p>
<p>FOR CHARGING AND PLEA DISPOSITIONS</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION: These standards are intended solely for the guidance of prosecutors in the state of Washington. They are not intended to, do not, and may not be relied upon to create a right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party in litigation with the state.</p>
<p>Evidentiary sufficiency.</p>
<ol>
<li>Decision not to prosecute.</li>
</ol>
<p>STANDARD: A prosecuting attorney may decline to prosecute, even though technically sufficient evidence to prosecute exists, in situations where prosecution would serve no public purpose, would defeat the underlying purpose of the law in question, or would result in decreased respect for the law. The decision not to prosecute or divert shall not be influenced by the race, gender, religion, or creed of the suspect.</p>
<p>GUIDELINES/COMMENTARY:</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>The following are examples of reasons not to prosecute which could satisfy the standard.</p>
<pre><code>a. Contrary to Legislative Intent - It may be proper to decline to charge where the application of criminal sanctions would be clearly contrary to the intent of the legislature in enacting the particular statute.

b. Antiquated Statute - It may be proper to decline to charge where the statute in question is antiquated in that:

    i. It has not been enforced for many years;

    ii. Most members of society act as if it were no longer in existence;

    iii. It serves no deterrent or protective purpose in today's society; and

    iv. The statute has not been recently reconsidered by the legislature.
</code></pre>
<p>This reason is not to be construed as the basis for declining cases because the law in question is unpopular or because it is difficult to enforce.</p>
<pre><code>c. De Minimis Violation - It may be proper to decline to charge where the violation of law is only technical or insubstantial and where no public interest or deterrent purpose would be served by prosecution.

d. Confinement on Other Charges - It may be proper to decline to charge because the accused has been sentenced on another charge to a lengthy period of confinement; and

    i. Conviction of the new offense would not merit any additional direct or collateral punishment;

    ii. The new offense is either a misdemeanor or a felony which is not particularly aggravated; and

    iii. Conviction of the new offense would not serve any significant deterrent purpose.

e. Pending Conviction on Another Charge - It may be proper to decline to charge because the accused is facing a pending prosecution in the same or another county; and

    i. Conviction of the new offense would not merit any additional direct or collateral punishment;

    ii. Conviction in the pending prosecution is imminent;

    iii. The new offense is either a misdemeanor or a felony which is not particularly aggravated; and

    iv. Conviction of the new offense would not serve any significant deterrent purpose.

f. High Disproportionate Cost of Prosecution - It may be proper to decline to charge where the cost of locating or transporting, or the burden on, prosecution witnesses is highly disproportionate to the importance of prosecuting the offense in question. The reason should be limited to minor cases and should not be relied upon in serious cases.

g. Improper Motives of Complainant - It may be proper to decline charges because the motives of the complainant are improper and prosecution would serve no public purpose, would defeat the underlying purpose of the law in question, or would result in decreased respect for the law.

h. Immunity - It may be proper to decline to charge where immunity is to be given to an accused in order to prosecute another where the accused information or testimony will reasonably lead to the conviction of others who are responsible for more serious criminal conduct or who represent a greater danger to the public interest.

i. Party Harmed By Juvenile Request - It may be proper to decline to charge because the party harmed by the juvenile requests that no criminal charges be filed and the case involves the following crimes or situations:

    i. Assault cases where the party harmed by the juvenile has suffered little or no injury;

    ii. Crimes against property, not involving violence, where no major loss was suffered;

    iii. Where doing so would not jeopardize the safety of society.
</code></pre>
<p>Care should be taken to insure that the  request of the party harmed by the juvenile is freely made and is not the product of threats or pressure by the accused.</p>
<p>The presence of these factors may also justify the decision to dismiss a prosecution which has been commenced.</p>
<p>Notification</p>
<p>The prosecutor is encouraged to notify the party harmed by the juvenile, when practical, and the law enforcement personnel, of the decision not to prosecute.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Decision to prosecute.</li>
</ol>
<p>STANDARD:</p>
<p>Crimes against persons will be filed if sufficient admissible evidence exists, which, when considered with the most plausible, reasonably foreseeable defense that could be raised under the evidence, would justify conviction by a reasonable and objective fact finder. With regard to offenses prohibited by RCW 9A.44.040, 9A.44.050, 9A.44.073, 9A.44.076, 9A.44.079, 9A.44.083, 9A.44.086, 9A.44.089, and 9A.64.020 the prosecutor should avoid prefiling agreements or diversions intended to place the accused in a program of treatment or counseling, so that treatment, if determined to be beneficial, can be proved under RCW 13.40.160(4).</p>
<p>Crimes against property/other crimes will be filed if the admissible evidence is of such convincing force as to make it probable that a reasonable and objective fact finder would convict after hearing all the admissible evidence and the most plausible defense that could be raised.</p>
<p>The categorization of crimes for these charging standards shall be the same as found in RCW 9.94A.411(2).</p>
<p>The decision to prosecute or use diversion shall not be influenced by the race, gender, religion, or creed of the respondent.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Selection of Charges/Degree of Charge</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The prosecutor should file charges which adequately describe the nature of the respondent's conduct. Other offenses may be charged only if they are necessary to ensure that the charges</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>will significantly enhance the strength of the state's case at trial</p>
<p>.</p>
<pre><code>b. The prosecutor should not overcharge to obtain a guilty plea. Overcharging includes:

    i. Charging a higher degree;

    ii. Charging additional counts.
</code></pre>
<p>This standard is intended to direct prosecutors to charge those crimes which demonstrate the nature and seriousness of a respondent's criminal conduct, but to decline to charge crimes which are not necessary to such an indication. Crimes which do not merge as a matter of law, but which arise from the same course of conduct, do not all have to be charged.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Police Investigation</li>
</ol>
<p>A prosecuting attorney is dependent upon law enforcement agencies to conduct the necessary factual investigation which must precede the decision to prosecute. The prosecuting attorney shall ensure that a thorough factual investigation has been conducted before a decision to prosecute is made. In ordinary circumstances the investigation should include the following:</p>
<pre><code>a. The interviewing of all material witnesses, together with the obtaining of written statements whenever possible;

b. The completion of necessary laboratory tests; and

c. The obtaining, in accordance with constitutional requirements, of the suspect's version of the events.
</code></pre>
<p>If the initial investigation is incomplete, a prosecuting attorney should insist upon further investigation before a decision to prosecute is made, and specify what the investigation needs to include.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Exceptions</li>
</ol>
<p>In certain situations, a prosecuting attorney may authorize filing of a criminal complaint before the investigation is complete if:</p>
<pre><code>a. Probable cause exists to believe the suspect is guilty; and

b. The suspect presents a danger to the community or is likely to flee if not apprehended; or

c. The arrest of the suspect is necessary to complete the investigation of the crime.
</code></pre>
<p>In the event that the exception to the standard is applied, the prosecuting attorney shall obtain a commitment from the law enforcement agency involved to complete the investigation in a timely manner. If the subsequent investigation does not produce sufficient evidence to meet the normal charging standard, the complaint should be dismissed.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Investigation Techniques</li>
</ol>
<p>The prosecutor should be fully advised of the investigatory techniques that were used in the case investigation including:</p>
<pre><code>a. Polygraph testing;

b. Hypnosis;

c. Electronic surveillance;

d. Use of informants.
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>Prefiling Discussions with Defendant</li>
</ol>
<p>Discussions with the defendant or his or her representative regarding the selection or disposition of charges may occur prior to the filing of charges, and potential agreements can be reached.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Plea dispositions:</li>
</ol>
<p>STANDARD</p>
<pre><code>a. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a respondent will normally be expected to plead guilty to the charge or charges which adequately describe the nature of his or her criminal conduct or go to trial.

b. In certain circumstances, a plea agreement with a respondent in exchange for a plea of guilty to a charge or charges that may not fully describe the nature of his or her criminal conduct may be necessary and in the public interest. Such situations may include the following:

    i. Evidentiary problems which make conviction of the original charges doubtful;

    ii. The respondent's willingness to cooperate in the investigation or prosecution of others whose criminal conduct is more serious or represents a greater public threat;

    iii. A request by the party harmed by the juvenile when it is not the result of pressure from the respondent;

    iv. The discovery of facts which mitigate the seriousness of the respondent's conduct;

v. The correction of errors in the initial charging decision;

vi. The respondent's history with respect to criminal activity;

vii. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses charged;

viii. The probable effect of witnesses.

c. No plea agreement shall be influenced by the race, gender, religion, or creed of the respondent. This includes but is not limited to the prosecutor's decision to utilize such disposition alternatives as the Special Sex Offender Disposition Alternative, the Chemical Dependency Disposition Alternative, and manifest injustice.

<p>The purpose of this disposition alternative is to ensure that successful treatment options to reduce recidivism are available to eligible youth, pursuant to RCW 71.24.615. It is also the purpose of the disposition alternative to assure that minors in need of substance use disorder, mental health, and/or co-occurring disorder treatment receive an appropriate continuum of culturally relevant care and treatment, including prevention and early intervention, self-directed care, parent-directed care, and residential treatment. To facilitate the continuum of care and treatment to minors in out-of-home placements, all divisions of the department that provide these services to minors shall jointly plan and deliver these services. It is also the purpose of the disposition alternative to protect the rights of minors against needless hospitalization and deprivations of liberty and to enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs and in accordance with sound professional judgment. The mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring disorder treatment providers shall, to the extent possible, offer services that involve minors' parents, guardians, and family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court must consider eligibility for the substance use disorder or mental health disposition alternative when a juvenile offender is subject to a standard range disposition of local sanctions or 15 to 36 weeks of confinement and has not committed an A- or B+ offense, other than a first time B+ offense under chapter 69.50 RCW. The court, on its own motion or the motion of the state or the respondent if the evidence shows that the offender may be chemically dependent, substance abusing, or has significant mental health or co-occurring disorders may order an examination by a substance use disorder counselor from a substance use disorder treatment facility approved under chapter 70.96A RCW or a mental health professional as defined in chapter 71.34 RCW to determine if the youth is chemically dependent, substance abusing, or suffers from significant mental health or co-occurring disorders. The state shall pay the cost of any examination ordered under this subsection unless third-party insurance coverage is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report of the examination shall include at a minimum the following: The respondent's version of the facts and the official version of the facts, the respondent's offense history, an assessment of drug-alcohol problems, mental health diagnoses, previous treatment attempts, the respondent's social, educational, and employment situation, and other evaluation measures used. The report shall set forth the sources of the examiner's information.</p>

<li>
<p>The examiner shall assess and report regarding the respondent's relative risk to the community. A proposed treatment plan shall be provided and shall include, at a minimum:</p>

<p>After receipt of reports of the examination, the court shall then consider whether the offender and the community will benefit from use of this disposition alternative and consider the harmed party's opinion whether the offender should receive a treatment disposition under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court determines that this disposition alternative is appropriate, then the court shall impose the standard range for the offense, or if the court concludes, and enters reasons for its conclusion, that such disposition would effectuate a manifest injustice, the court shall impose a disposition above the standard range as indicated in option D of RCW 13.40.0357 if the disposition is an increase from the standard range and the confinement of the offender does not exceed a maximum of fifty-two weeks, suspend execution of the disposition, and place the offender on community supervision for up to one year. As a condition of the suspended disposition, the court shall require the offender to undergo available outpatient drug/alcohol, mental health, or co-occurring disorder treatment and/or inpatient mental health or drug/alcohol treatment. The court shall only order inpatient treatment under this section if a funded bed is available. If the inpatient treatment is longer than ninety days, the court shall hold a review hearing every thirty days beyond the initial ninety days. The respondent may appear telephonically at these review hearings if in compliance with treatment. As a condition of the suspended disposition, the court may impose conditions of community supervision and other sanctions, including up to thirty days of confinementand eight hours of community service.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mental health/co-occurring disorder/drug/alcohol treatment provider shall submit monthly reports on the respondent's progress in treatment to the court and the parties. The reports shall reference the treatment plan and include at a minimum the following: Dates of attendance, respondent's compliance with requirements, treatment activities, the respondent's relative progress in treatment, and any other material specified by the court at the time of the disposition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time of the disposition, the court may set treatment review hearings as the court considers appropriate.</p>
<p>If the offender violates any condition of the disposition or the court finds that the respondent is failing to make satisfactory progress in treatment, the court may impose sanctions pursuant to RCW 13.40.200 or revoke the suspension and order execution of the disposition. The court shall give credit for any confinement time previously served if that confinement was for the offense for which the suspension is being revoked.</p>

If, after affording a juvenile all of the due process rights to which he or she would be entitled if the juvenile were an adult, the secretary finds that a juvenile has violated a condition of his or her parole, the secretary shall order one of the following which is reasonably likely to effectuate the purpose of the parole and to protect the public: (i) Continued supervision under the same conditions previously imposed; (ii) intensified supervision with increased reporting requirements; (iii) additional conditions of supervision authorized by this chapter; (iv) except as provided in (a)(v) , (vi), and (vii) of this subsection, imposition of a period of confinement not to exceed thirty days in a facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state of Washington or any city or county for a portion of each day or for a certain number of days each week with the balance of the days or weeks spent under supervision; (v) the secretary may order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for the remainder of the sentence range if the offense for which the offender was sentenced is rape in the first or second degree, rape of a child in the first or second degree, child molestation in the first degree, indecent liberties with forcible compulsion, or a sex offense that is also a serious violent offense as defined by RCW 9.94A.030;  (vi) the secretary may order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for the remainder of the sentence range if the youth has completed the basic training camp program as described in RCW 13.40.320; and (vii) the secretary may not order confinement for the sole reason that the offender failed to perform community service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary may modify parole and order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for up to twenty-four weeks if the offender was sentenced for a sex offense as defined under RCW 9A.44.128 and is known to have violated the terms of parole. Confinement beyond thirty days is intended to only be used for a small and limited number of sex offenders. It shall only be used when other graduated sanctions or interventions have not been effective or the behavior is so egregious it warrants the use of the higher level intervention and the violation: (i) Is a known pattern of behavior consistent with a previous sex offense that puts the youth at high risk for reoffending sexually; (ii) consists of sexual behavior that is determined to be predatory as defined in RCW 71.09.020; or (iii) requires a review under chapter 71.09 RCW, due to a recent overt act. The total number of days of confinement for violations of parole conditions during the parole period shall not exceed the number of days provided by the maximum sentence imposed by the disposition for the underlying offense pursuant to RCW 13.40.0357. The department shall not aggregate multiple parole violations that occur prior to the parole revocation hearing and impose consecutive twenty-four week periods of confinement for each parole violation. The department is authorized to engage in rule making pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, to implement this subsection, including narrowly defining the behaviors that could lead to this higher level intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the department finds that any juvenile in a program of parole has possessed a firearm or used a deadly weapon during the program of parole, the department shall modify the parole under (a) of this subsection and confine the juvenile for at least thirty days. Confinement shall be in a facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state or any county.</p>

<p>Every sentence imposed for a crime specified in RCW 43.43.754 must include a fee of one hundred dollars unless the state has previously collected the offender's DNA as a result of a prior conviction or the offender is under the age of 18. The fee is a court‑ordered legal financial obligation as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 and other applicable law. For a sentence imposed under chapter 9.94A RCW, the fee is payable by the offender after payment of all other legal financial obligations included in the sentence has been completed. For all other sentences, the fee is payable by the offender in the same manner as other assessments imposed. The clerk of the court shall transmit eighty percent of the fee collected to the state treasurer for deposit in the state DNA database account created under RCW 43.43.7532, and shall transmit twenty percent of the fee collected to the agency responsible for collection of a biological sample from the offender as required under RCW 43.43.754. This fee shall not be imposed on juvenile offenders .</p>
