<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Clerk&quot; means the clerk of the superior court or the court administrator of a court of limited jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Collection cost&quot; means any fee or cost paid to a collection agency as a result of a qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction. A collection cost is &quot;readily ascertainable&quot; if the clerk or collection agency maintains a record or accounting of the collection cost or the defendant has provided documentation of the collection cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Cost of supervision&quot; means any supervision fee or cost paid to the department of corrections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Document-verified collateral cost&quot; means any fee or cost paid for a person's participation in a program or activity resulting from a qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction, including but not limited to electronic home monitoring costs, work release fees, costs of drug evaluations, cost of treatment, probation costs, and jail time in lieu of legal financial obligations, the payment of which is verified by documentation carrying sufficient indicia of reliability per guidance issued by the administrative office of the courts. A fee or cost paid to a collection agency is not considered a document-verified collateral cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Legal financial obligation&quot; means a sum of money that is ordered by a superior, district, or municipal court of the state of Washington for legal financial obligations, which may include restitution to the victim, court costs, county or interlocal drug funds, court-appointed attorneys' fees, accrued interest, costs of defense, fines, and any other financial obligation that is assessed on the defendant as a result of a qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction. A legal financial obligation does not include any fee related to reissuing or reinstating a driver's license under chapter 46.20 RCW. A nonconviction legal financial obligation is &quot;readily ascertainable&quot; if the clerk, adult or juvenile court, prosecuting authority, or any diversion unit administered by the jurisdiction maintains a record or accounting of the nonconviction legal financial obligation or the defendant has provided documentation of the nonconviction legal financial obligation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Prosecuting authority&quot; means any prosecuting attorney as defined in RCW 36.27.005 or 35.23.111 or any attorney authorized to prosecute cases in courts of limited jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Qualifying conviction&quot; means any conviction or juvenile adjudication of a qualifying offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Qualifying nonconviction&quot; means any adult or juvenile charge for a qualifying offense that was dismissed or not filed following successful completion of a diversion program, deferred prosecution, therapeutic court, or similar program. However, if the person was participating in the diversion program, deferred prosecution, therapeutic court, or other program, for multiple charges on an indictment, information, or affidavit where one or more charged offenses were not qualifying offenses, then the charge for the qualifying offense does not constitute a qualifying nonconviction under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Qualifying offense&quot; includes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Any of the following offenses where possession of a substance is criminalized without proof that the person knowingly possessed the substance: RCW 69.50.4013 (simple possession of a controlled substance, 2004-2021); RCW 69.50.401 (simple possession of a controlled substance, 1971-2004); RCW 69.33.020 or 69.33.230 (simple possession of narcotics, 1951-1971); RCW 69.50.401 (possession of less than 40 grams of marijuana, 1971-2004); RCW 69.50.4014 (possession of less than 40 grams of marijuana, 2004-2021); RCW 69.41.030 and 69.41.070 (possession of legend drugs, 1973-2004); RCW 69.41.030 (possession of legend drugs, 2004-2021); RCW 69.50.4011 (possession of counterfeit substances, 2004-2021); RCW 69.50.412 (use of drug paraphernalia to inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce a controlled substance into the human body, 1981-2021);</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Any attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any offense under (a) or (b) of this subsection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any of the following offenses when such an offense was predicated solely on a conviction of any offense under (a), (b), or (c) of this subsection: RCW 9.41.040(2)(a) (unlawful possession of a firearm, 2003-2021); RCW 9.41.040(1)(b) (unlawful possession of a firearm, 1994-2003); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any offense that the state supreme court rules unconstitutional in light of State v. Blake, No. 96873-0 (decided February 25, 2021).</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any person with a qualifying conviction is eligible to have such conviction vacated by the sentencing court under this chapter. The restrictions under RCW 9.96.060 and 9.94A.640 do not apply to motions or applications filed under this chapter. Any person with a qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction is eligible for a refund of all legal financial obligations, collection costs, and document-verified collateral costs paid as a result of the qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction as provided in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from the clerk under section 10 of this act, a prosecuting authority shall review all qualifying convictions and qualifying nonconvictions within his or her jurisdiction.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For each qualifying conviction and qualifying nonconviction, the prosecuting authority shall:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Coordinate with the appropriate clerk and other appropriate entities to develop a list of all legal financial obligation amounts and readily ascertainable collection cost amounts paid as a result of the qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine whether the person is currently serving a sentence for any offense under the supervision of the department of corrections, and in such case, notify the office of public defense that the person may be eligible for resentencing under section 6 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>For each qualifying conviction, the prosecuting authority shall file an ex parte motion by January 1, 2026, with the applicable sentencing court to dismiss and vacate the conviction under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each qualifying nonconviction where legal financial obligations or readily ascertainable collection costs were paid as a result of the qualifying nonconviction, the prosecuting authority shall file an ex parte motion by January 1, 2026, with the applicable sentencing court to refund the legal financial obligations and readily ascertainable collection costs under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A motion under this section may include documentation of the amount of legal financial obligations and readily ascertainable collection costs paid by the person as a result of the qualifying conviction or nonconviction. The prosecuting authority is not required to notify the defendant of the motion, and the court shall consider a motion under this section without requiring the presence of the parties or counsel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The clerk must conduct an objectively reasonable search for collection cost records and nonconviction legal financial obligation records. The adequacy of a search is judged by the standard of reasonableness. A reasonable search usually begins with the clerk or designated employee deciding where the records are likely to be and who is likely to know where they are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conducting an objectively reasonable search for collection cost records, in addition to searching the clerk's own records, the clerk shall issue a written request to any current or past contracted collection agency to provide all records and allocations of payments made under qualifying convictions or qualifying nonconvictions. After issuing a written request, the clerk shall also make substantial efforts to obtain the requested records from the collection agency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>A person with a qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction may file a motion with the sentencing court for a vacation of the conviction and a refund of legal financial obligation, collection cost, or document-verified collateral cost amounts, or a refund of nonconviction legal financial obligation, collection cost, or document-verified collateral cost amounts, regardless of whether a prosecuting authority is expected to file a motion under section 3 of this act. A person moving for a vacation of a conviction or a refund under this section shall set the motion for hearing in accordance with local court rules, but in no case sooner than 30 days from the date of filing, unless the court finds good cause to shorten the time. For a motion for a refund brought under this section, the prosecuting authority shall furnish the applicant with the amount paid by the applicant for any legal financial obligations and readily ascertainable collection costs 14 court days in advance of the hearing. The movant may also demonstrate payment of legal financial obligations, collection costs, and document-verified collateral costs by submitting copies of records demonstrating payment and by sworn declaration. The prosecuting authority may object to a motion for vacation of the conviction only on the basis that the conviction is not a qualifying conviction.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon a determination by the court to vacate any qualifying conviction under this chapter, the court shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Set aside each guilty plea or verdict, dismiss with prejudice the count or counts in the information, indictment, complaint, or citation that relates to the qualifying conviction or convictions, and vacate the judgment and sentence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quash any outstanding warrants related to the vacated qualifying conviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release the individual from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the qualifying conviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prohibit the qualifying conviction from being included in a person's criminal history for the purposes of determining bail in a subsequent prosecution or a sentence in any subsequent conviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct the clerk to notify the department of licensing to reinstate the person's privilege to drive, if suspended due to the qualifying conviction;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Order the administrative office of the courts to refund any documented legal financial obligation, collection cost, and document-verified collateral cost amounts paid as a result of the qualifying conviction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include in the order a statement informing the person of the right to challenge the amount refunded under the order and that if the person is indigent, the person may request publicly funded counsel, subject to available funding for this purpose, to assist in reviewing the refund determination and bringing a motion to amend the refund amount, as provided in section 8 of this act; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include in the order a statement that the defendant's conviction is vacated as unconstitutional pursuant to State v. Blake, 197 Wn.2d 170, 481 P.3d 521 (2021).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a court order to vacate a qualifying conviction under this section, the clerk shall transmit notice of the vacate order to the Washington state patrol identification section, and shall transmit the certification, and all documentation in support of the certified amount to the administrative office of the courts refund bureau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of notice of a court order to vacate a qualifying conviction under this section, the Washington state patrol shall have no more than seven working days to update their records to reflect the vacation of the qualifying conviction, and shall transmit the order vacating the conviction to the federal bureau of investigation. A qualifying conviction that has been vacated under this section may not be disseminated or disclosed by the state patrol, prosecuting authority, or local law enforcement agency to any person, except other criminal justice enforcement agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A qualifying conviction vacated under this chapter may not be included in the person's criminal history for purposes of determining bail in a subsequent prosecution or a sentence in any subsequent conviction, and the person must be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment applications, a person whose qualifying conviction has been vacated may state that he or she has never been convicted of that crime. For any qualifying conviction vacated under this section, a prosecuting authority may not refile any charges for acts alleged in the original indictment, information, or affidavit of probable cause filed in relation to the qualifying conviction, and may not file new or additional charges based on acts alleged in any law enforcement report from which the qualifying conviction arose.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the vacation of a qualifying conviction under this chapter affects a sentence imposed for a separate conviction by altering the person's criminal history as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, then the person may file a motion to be resentenced in the applicable sentencing court. Any person with a qualifying conviction who is serving a current or pending sentence under the supervision of the department of corrections has a right to court-appointed counsel for resentencing proceedings under this section consistent with the provisions set forth in chapter 10.101 RCW. For the purposes of this chapter, individuals incarcerated under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections are presumed indigent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A prosecuting authority may not file or refile previously dismissed charges contained in any indictment, information, or affidavit of probable cause filed in relation to the conviction for which the person qualifies for resentencing under this section, and may not file new or additional charges based on acts alleged in any law enforcement report from which the conviction arose for which the person is being resentenced.</p>

<ol type="a">

</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the clerk with an approved itemized and totaled amount of documented legal financial obligation, collection cost, and document-verified collateral cost amounts to be refunded; and</p>

<li>
<p>Within three years of issuance of a refund amount from the refund bureau, a person may challenge the amount of any legal financial obligation or collection cost refund ordered by the court under section 5 or 7 of this act if the order resulted from a motion brought under section 3 of this act by bringing a motion to amend the order's refund amount in the court that issued the order. A person may also move to amend the refund amount to include document-verified collateral costs paid as a result of the qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction. Any motion to challenge or amend the refund amount must include documentation to support any additional refund amounts sought. A person bringing a motion to challenge the refund amount must notify the refund bureau of the challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the person is indigent, and if the refund amount was ordered as a result of a motion brought under section 3 of this act, the person may request the services of counsel, subject to funding appropriated for this specific purpose to the office of civil legal aid or the office of public defense, to review the refund determination and to assist in bringing a good-faith motion to amend the refund amount in the court that issued the order. The provision of publicly funded counsel under this section will be coordinated by the office of public defense and the office of civil legal aid. For the purpose of this section, &quot;indigent&quot; has the same meaning given in RCW 10.101.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A motion to amend the refund amount brought under this section is not a collateral attack as defined under RCW 10.73.090. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting a person's right to appeal a court order under applicable Washington court rules.</p>
