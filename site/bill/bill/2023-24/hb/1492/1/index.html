The restrictions under RCW 9.96.060 and 9.94A.640 do not apply to motions or applications filed under this chapter. Any person with a qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction is eligible for a refund of all legal financial obligations paid as a result of the qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction as provided in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a report from the clerk under section 9 of this act, a prosecuting attorney shall review all qualifying convictions and nonconvictions within his or her jurisdiction.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For each qualifying conviction and qualifying nonconviction, the prosecuting attorney shall:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Coordinate with the appropriate clerk and other appropriate entities to develop a list of all legal financial obligation amounts paid as a result of the qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction. The prosecutor shall include legal financial obligation amounts paid to private, third-party agencies with whom the courts or local jurisdictions have contractual relationships for the collection of legal financial obligations, the department of corrections, and other private entities to the extent those amounts are known or readily ascertainable, or if the person subject to the qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction has provided the prosecutor with documentation of legal financial obligation amounts paid to private entities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine whether the person is currently serving a sentence for any offense under the supervision of the department of corrections, and in such case, notify the state office of public defense that the person may be eligible for resentencing under section 6 of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each qualifying conviction, the prosecuting attorney shall file an ex parte motion by January 1, 2026, with the applicable sentencing court to dismiss and vacate the conviction under this chapter.</p>

<p>For each qualifying nonconviction where legal financial obligations were paid as a result of the qualifying nonconviction, the prosecuting attorney shall file an ex parte motion by January 1, 2026, with the applicable sentencing court to refund the legal financial obligations under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A motion under this section must include documentation of the amount of legal financial obligations paid by the person as a result of the qualifying conviction or nonconviction. The prosecuting attorney is not required to notify the defendant of the motion, and the court shall consider a motion under this section without requiring the presence of the prosecuting attorney or defendant.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>By July 1, 2023, prosecuting attorneys shall submit to clerks in their respective jurisdictions a report on the status of all filed motions required under this section, including all filed motions to vacate pursuant to State v. Blake since the decision was issued. The report shall be in a format that includes, but is not limited to, cause level information in a searchable, tabulated file format which includes individual cause numbers, individual names, case outcomes, and legal financial reimbursement amounts for all cases. Beginning October 1, 2023, through January 1, 2026, prosecuting attorneys shall submit to the clerks on a quarterly basis a report in the same format with the same data points on the status of motions required under this section.

<li>
<p>A person with a qualifying conviction or nonconviction may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the conviction or a refund of nonconviction legal financial obligations under this chapter, regardless of whether a prosecuting attorney is expected to file a motion under section 3 of this act. If a person applies under this section, the prosecuting attorney shall respond to the application within 30 days. The prosecuting attorney may object to the application only on the basis that the conviction or nonconviction is not a qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction under this chapter and may otherwise provide clarifying documentation as to the legal financial obligations paid as a result of the qualifying conviction or qualifying nonconviction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person may challenge the amount of any legal financial obligation refund ordered by the court under section 5 or 7 of this act in the court that issued the order by bringing a motion to amend the order's refund amount. The person has a right to the assistance of counsel in reviewing the refund determination and in bringing a motion to amend the refund amount in the court that issued the order.</p>

<li>
<p>A qualifying conviction vacated under this chapter may not be included in the person's criminal history for purposes of determining bail in a subsequent prosecution or a sentence in any subsequent conviction, and the person must be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment applications, a person whose qualifying conviction has been vacated may state that he or she has never been convicted of that crime.

<h2 id="section-6">Section 6 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6">¶</a></h2>

<p>If the vacation of a qualifying conviction under this chapter affects a sentence imposed for a separate conviction by altering the person's offender score under RCW 9.94A.525, then the person may file a motion to be resentenced in the applicable sentencing court. Any person with a qualifying conviction who is currently serving a sentence under the supervision of the department of corrections has a right to the assistance of counsel for resentencing proceedings under this section.</p>
