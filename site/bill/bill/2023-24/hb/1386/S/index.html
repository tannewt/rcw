<p>&quot;Youth development&quot; means an intentional, strength-based approach that inclusively and equitably engages young people within their communities in a manner that centers youth voice and leadership. Youth development is culturally responsive, fosters positive relationships, and helps young people develop skills and competencies to achieve their goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Youth development program&quot; means a program for youth that focus on holistic outcomes by complementing school-day academics, promotes social and emotional well-being, and supports access to postsecondary career pathways. Youth development programs may not provide basic needs services such as shelter or food outside of program time, but they can function as a referral resource to help young people and families identify and navigate those services. A youth development program may include mentoring, expanded learning opportunities, afterschool or summer programs, school-aged child care, or other child supports that address the comprehensive needs of young people.</p>
