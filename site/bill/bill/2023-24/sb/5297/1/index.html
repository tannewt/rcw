<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that salmon fishery reform efforts have been made to promote the recovery of endangered species act listed populations of salmon and steelhead and make Washington's nontribal Columbia river salmon fisheries more selective and sustainable. The legislature further finds that these reforms are even more important as our salmon face increasing pressures due to climate change and habitat loss. The legislature further finds that Columbia river fishery management reforms call for the conservation, protection, recovery, and perpetuation of Columbia river salmon. The legislature further finds that Columbia river salmon reforms include the development of new alternative commercial selective-fishing gear that facilitates achieving conservation goals. The legislature further finds that the 2022 supplemental operating budget includes $14.4 million for a voluntary buyback of Columbia river gill net licenses to reduce the number of nontribal commercial gill net fishing licenses. The legislature further finds that the purpose of the buyback and recent fishery reforms has been to transition away from the use of gill nets in nontribal commercial salmon fisheries to optimize conservation benefits. The legislature further finds that the Washington department of fish and wildlife shall continue developing and implementing strategies for sustainable and selective harvest of surplus hatchery fish consistent with wild salmonid conservation and maintaining hatchery production that mitigates for habitat loss and supports marine and freshwater fisheries. The legislature further finds that nothing in this act affects tribal treaty fishing rights or state-tribal fishing agreements.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A person shall not use, operate, or maintain a gill net which exceeds one thousand five hundred feet in length or a drag seine in the waters of the Columbia river for catching salmon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>After January 1, 2025, a person shall not use, operate, or maintain within Washington state waters of the lower mainstem of the Columbia river a drift gill net or drift net for catching salmon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall reserve fishery impacts previously utilized in Washington waters of the lower mainstem of the Columbia river nontribal salmon gill net fisheries for conservation through increased wild salmonid escapement or mark selective fisheries capable of harvesting surplus hatchery-reared salmon where needed to meet federal genetic protection requirements for wild salmon populations in a manner consistent with state-tribal fishery management agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this subsection shall affect tribal treaty fishing rights, allowable fishing gears for tribal fisheries, or state-tribal fishing agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this section, a &quot;drift gill net&quot; or &quot;drift net&quot; means a gill net of single web construction, not anchored, tied, staked, placed, or weighted in such a manner that it cannot drift. The &quot;lower mainstem of the Columbia river&quot; means Washington waters in the mainstem of the Columbia river below Bonneville dam.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person shall not construct, install, use, operate, or maintain within state waters a pound net, round haul net, lampara net, fish trap, fish wheel, scow fish wheel, set net, weir, or fixed appliance for catching salmon or steelhead except under the authority of a trial or experimental fishery permit, when an emerging commercial fishery has been designated allowing use of one or more of these gear types. The director must consult with the commercial fishing interests that would be affected by the trial or experimental fishery permit. The director may authorize the use of this gear for scientific investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in coordination with the Oregon department of fish and wildlife, shall adopt rules to regulate the use of monofilament in gill net webbing on the Columbia river.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>The nontribal commercial gill net buyback account is created in the state treasury. Any moneys appropriated by the legislature must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may only be used to reduce the number of nontribal commercial gill net licenses on the Columbia river through a voluntary buyback program. The license buyback program shall compensate individual license holders, with priority given to those with higher reported landings.</p>
