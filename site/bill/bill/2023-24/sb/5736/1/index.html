<p>(1) The workforce education investment account is created in the state treasury. All revenues from the workforce investment surcharge created in RCW 82.04.299 and those revenues as specified under RCW 82.04.290(2)(c) must be deposited directly into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only for higher education programs, higher education operations, higher education compensation, state-funded student aid programs, and workforce development including career connected learning as defined by RCW 28C.30.020. Beginning in fiscal year 2024, and each year thereafter, an amount equal to the greater of all revenues collected under RCW 82.04.299 or 15 percent of all revenues in the account must be used exclusively for higher education programs that lead to a credential in advanced computing fields and related science, technology, engineering, and math computing fields to increase access and equity, especially for low-income students and students of color.</p>
