<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes there is a persistent health care workforce shortage in Washington state and across the country and that, in order to protect patient access to care amid a workforce shortage, hospitals must find new ways to deliver care while easing burdens on patient care unit staff. The legislature further recognizes that innovative hospital patient care unit staffing and care delivery models should be thoughtfully considered and disseminated across Washington state. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish a collaborative for the advancement of hospital patient care unit staffing and care delivery innovations to provide guidance, research, and recommendations for the benefit of those providing care in hospitals.</p>
