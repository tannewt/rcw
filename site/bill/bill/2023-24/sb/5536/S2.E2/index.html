</li>
<li>
<p>Every person convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the applicant's record of conviction for the offense.

</li>
<li>
<p>The offense was a violation of RCW 46.61.502 (driving while under the influence), 46.61.504 (actual physical control while under the influence), 9.91.020 (operating a railroad, etc. while intoxicated), or the offense is considered a &quot;prior offense&quot; under RCW 46.61.5055 and the applicant has had a subsequent alcohol or drug violation within ten years of the date of arrest for the prior offense or less than ten years has elapsed since the date of the arrest for the prior offense;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The offense was any misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor violation, including attempt, of chapter 9.68 RCW (obscenity and pornography), chapter 9.68A RCW (sexual exploitation of children), or chapter 9A.44 RCW (sex offenses), except for failure to register as a sex offender under RCW 9A.44.132;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant was convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense as defined in RCW 10.99.020, or the court determines after a review of the court file that the offense was committed by one family or household member against another or by one intimate partner against another, or the court, after considering the damage to person or property that resulted in the conviction, any prior convictions for crimes defined in RCW 10.99.020, or for comparable offenses in another state or in federal court, and the totality of the records under review by the court regarding the conviction being considered for vacation, determines that the offense involved domestic violence, and any one of the following factors exist:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The applicant has not provided written notification of the vacation petition to the prosecuting attorney's office that prosecuted the offense for which vacation is sought, or has not provided that notification to the court;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant has two or more domestic violence convictions stemming from different incidents. For purposes of this subsection, however, if the current application is for more than one conviction that arose out of a single incident, none of those convictions counts as a previous conviction;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Less than five years have elapsed since the person completed the terms of the original conditions of the sentence, including any financial obligations and successful completion of any treatment ordered as a condition of sentencing;</p>

When preparing or filing the petition, the prosecutor is not deemed to be providing legal advice or legal assistance on behalf of the victim, but is fulfilling an administrative function on behalf of the state in order to further their responsibility to seek to reform and improve the administration of criminal justice. A record of conviction vacated using the process in RCW 9.96.080 is subject to subsections  (7) and (8) of this section.</p>

<p>Each behavioral health administrative services organization shall establish  recovery navigator programs with the goal of providing law enforcement and other criminal legal system personnel with a credible alternative to further legal system involvement for criminal activity that stems from unmet behavioral health needs or poverty. The programs shall work to improve community health and safety by reducing individuals' involvement with the criminal legal system through the use of specific human services tools and in coordination with community input. Each program must include a dedicated project manager and be governed by a policy coordinating group comprised, in alignment with the core principles, of local executive and legislative officials, public safety agencies, including police and prosecutors, and civil rights, public defense, and human services organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recovery navigator programs shall be organized on a scale that permits meaningful engagement, collaboration, and coordination with local law enforcement and municipal agencies through the policy coordinating groups. The programs shall provide community-based outreach, intake, assessment, and connection to services and, as appropriate, long-term intensive case management and recovery coaching services, to youth and adults with substance use disorder, including for persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, who are referred to the program from diverse sources and shall facilitate and coordinate connections to a broad range of community resources for youth and adults with substance use disorder, including treatment and recovery support services.

The uniform program standards must incorporate the law enforcement assisted diversion framework for diversion at multiple points of engagement with the criminal legal system, including prearrest, prebooking, prefiling, and for ongoing case conferencing with law enforcement, prosecutors, community stakeholders, and program case managers. The authority must adopt the uniform program standards from the components of the law enforcement assisted diversion program to accommodate an expanded population of persons with substance use disorders, including persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, provide for referrals from a broad range of sources, and require prioritization of those who are or likely will be exposed to the criminal legal system related to their behavioral health challenges. In addition to accepting referrals from law enforcement and courts of limited jurisdiction, the uniform program standards must provide guidance for accepting referrals on behalf of persons with substance use disorders, including persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, from various sources including, but not limited to, self-referral, family members of the individual, emergency department personnel, persons engaged with serving homeless persons, including those living unsheltered or in encampments, fire department personnel, emergency medical service personnel, community-based organizations, members of the business community, harm reduction program personnel, faith-based organization staff, and other sources within the criminal legal system, so that individuals are engaged as early as possible within the sequential intercept model. In developing response time requirements within the statewide program standards, the authority shall require, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, that responses to referrals from law enforcement occur immediately for in-custody referrals and shall strive for rapid response times to other appropriate settings such as emergency departments and courts of limited jurisdiction.</p>

<li>
<p>Each behavioral health administrative services organization must have a substance use disorder regional administrator for its recovery navigator program. The regional administrator shall be responsible for assuring compliance with program standards, including staffing standards. Each recovery navigator program must maintain a sufficient number of appropriately trained personnel for providing intake and referral services, conducting comprehensive biopsychosocial assessments, providing intensive case management services, and making warm handoffs to treatment and recovery support services along the continuum of care. Program staff must include people with lived experience with substance use disorder to the extent possible. The substance use disorder regional administrator must assure that staff who are conducting intake and referral services and field assessments are paid a livable and competitive wage and have appropriate initial training and receive continuing education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each recovery navigator program must submit quarterly reports to the authority with information identified by the authority and the substance use recovery services advisory committee. The reports must be provided to the substance use recovery services advisory committee for discussion at meetings following the submission of the reports.</p>
