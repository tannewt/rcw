<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washington is a technology leader on a national and global level and holds a distinctive position in creating frameworks around technology that enhance innovation while protecting consumers and promoting fairness, accountability, and transparency for all Washingtonians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated decision systems are rapidly being adopted to make or assist in core decisions in a variety of government and business functions, including criminal justice, health care, education, employment, public benefits, insurance, and commerce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These automated decision systems are currently unregulated, may be deployed without public notice, and vendors selling the systems may require restrictive contractual provisions that undermine government transparency and accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average Washington resident is unlikely to understand processes used by these automated decision systems, yet these systems are increasingly used to make core government and business decisions impacting the civil rights and liberties of Washingtonians, raising significant concerns around due process, fairness, accountability, and transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A growing body of research shows that reliance on automated decision systems without adequate transparency, oversight, or safeguards can undermine market predictability, harm consumers, and deny historically disadvantaged or vulnerable groups the full measure of their civil rights and liberties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research has shown that even the most innocent looking management tools often incorporate and compound the assumptions of institutional racism and other unfounded stereotypes. It is a matter of good governance to ensure that agencies consider whether the technologies they use improperly advantage or disadvantage Washington residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to enhance innovation and ensure the use of these systems in ways that benefit Washington residents, the legislature intends to ensure the fair, transparent, and accountable use of automated decision systems.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>By January 1, 2023, the office shall, in consultation with the office of equity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adopt guidance for agencies regarding the development, procurement, and use of automated decision systems by a public agency. This guidance must incorporate the minimum standards and procedures set forth in sections 4 and 5 of this act with respect to automated decision systems. In adopting the guidance, the office must consult with representatives of communities whose rights are disproportionately impacted by automated decision systems as demonstrated by current studies; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop guidance for agencies to use when prioritizing analysis of automated decision systems. The guidance must include a prioritization framework or frameworks for identifying the order in which to examine existing and proposed automated decision systems. This prioritization framework may include criteria such as whether the system: Creates significant effects on identified or identifiable natural persons; affects many people; involves a high risk of error or bias; has been developed without transparency of the information used to develop the algorithm; or has not been independently tested for bias or inaccuracy. The prioritization framework must include identification of significantly high-risk systems according to the established criteria.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>Subject to the staged review provisions of this chapter and the responsibility of agencies to establish priorities and timelines for compliance, the legislature finds that the following minimum standards should apply to a public agency's development, procurement, or use of an automated decision system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Agencies and the office, in consultation with the office of equity, should adopt interim and then long-term prioritization frameworks for allocating resources to address existing and future automated decision systems and to address any deficiencies found in compliance with this section. The prioritization frameworks should be used in determining the level of resources to be devoted first to examining existing and proposed systems and then to meeting the other requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a part of the procurement process, agencies should assess new automated decision systems procured by them. The assessment should include evaluation of the potential impacts of the automated decision system on: (a) The risk to rights and freedoms to an identified or identifiable natural person; (b) the existence or risk of bias or inaccuracy in the results of the system; and (c) whether the workings of the system are transparent to the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated decision systems currently in use by the state that produce legal effects on identified or identifiable natural persons should be assessed according to the prioritization framework. The assessment should include the existence or risk of bias or inaccuracy in the results and how transparent the system use and impacts are to the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies should provide transparency of use, procurement, and development of automated decision systems, including monitoring or testing for accuracy and bias, that produce legal effects on identified or identifiable natural persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing monitoring or auditing should be performed on automated decision systems that have legal effects on identified or identifiable natural persons to ensure they do not have differential effects on subpopulations that result over time; or discriminate against an individual, or treat an individual less favorably than another, in whole or in part, on the basis of one or more factors enumerated in RCW 49.60.010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies should provide training of state employees who develop, procure, operate, or use automated decision systems as to the risk of automation bias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public agency that develops, procures, or uses an automated decision system must follow any conditions set forth in the relevant algorithmic accountability report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the staged implementation as outlined in this chapter, a public agency must, at a minimum:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Give clear notice in plain language to the people impacted by the automated decision system of the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The fact that the system is in use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system's name, vendor, and version;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What decision or decisions it will be used to make or support;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether it is an automated final decision system or automated support decision system and whether and through what process a human verifies or confirms decisions made by the automated decision system;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What policies and guidelines apply to its deployment; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="i" start="6">
<li>How people may contest any decision made involving the automated decision system as required pursuant to this section;</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>
<p>Ensure that with respect to newly acquired automated decision systems and, to the maximum extent practicable with respect to existing automated decision systems, the system and the data used to develop the system are made freely available by the vendor before, during, and after deployment for agency or independent third-party testing, auditing, or research to understand its impacts, including potential bias, inaccuracy, or disparate impacts, provided that the vendor may specify that an independent third party examining proprietary trade secrets shall reveal only the outcome of the examination, and not the content of the trade secrets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that any decision made or informed by the automated decision system is subject to appeal, immediate suspension if a legal right, duty, or privilege is impacted by the decision, and potential reversal by a human decision maker through a timely process not to exceed 20 days, and clearly described and accessible to people impacted by the decision; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure the agency can explain the basis for its decision to any impacted people in terms understandable to a layperson including, without limitation, by requiring the vendor to create such an explanation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procurement contract for an automated decision system entered into by a public agency after the effective date of this section must ensure that the minimum standards set forth in this section are able to be effectuated without impairment, including requiring the vendor to waive any legal claims that may impair these minimum standards. Such a contract may not contain nondisclosure or other provisions that prohibit or impair these minimum standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>The intent of this section is to structure the way in which public agencies examine their existing and proposed automated decision systems and to identify for the legislature, the governor, and the public instances in which such examination is either incomplete or reveals that the applicable automated decision system fails to meet the minimum requirements of section 4 of this act. Subject to such intent:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Agencies already using an automated decision system as of the effective date of this section must provide a list of automated decision systems in use to the algorithmic accountability review board by January 1, 2024, and use the prioritization framework established under section 3 of this act or adopt and implement an interim prioritization framework to identify the order in which to complete an algorithmic accountability report on each existing automated decision system by January 1, 2026. For the purpose of this subsection:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The algorithmic accountability report must, at minimum, include clear and understandable statements based on information already available to the agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The algorithmic accountability report must accurately report only the actual direct knowledge contained in the files. For example, if the files contain a statement from the vendor that the system has been examined for bias but there is no report available for examination, the agency may not report that the system has been examined for bias and must instead report that the vendor states that the system has been examined for bias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agencies may include information not already contained in their files. For example, a bias report conducted by a third party may be included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of systems and prioritization frameworks must be available to the public and may include criteria such as whether the system: Creates significant effects on identified or identifiable natural persons; affects many people; involves a high risk of error or bias; has been developed without transparency of the information used to develop the algorithm; or has not been independently tested for bias or inaccuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For systems that involve high risk pursuant to the prioritization framework, the algorithmic accountability report must include an evaluation of accuracy and bias by a qualified independent third party, and if such a report does not currently exist it must nevertheless be prepared and included to meet the timelines for submission of an algorithmic accountability report on such system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an agency does not complete an algorithmic accountability report for each automated decision system already in use by January 1, 2026, then, unless the agency has been evaluating their systems in good faith based on the established prioritization framework and is granted an extension by the algorithmic accountability review board, the agency must cease use of the unevaluated automated decision system until such time as an extension is granted or the algorithmic accountability report is provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any request for extension of the deadline must include a timeline for when each algorithmic accountability report will be provided by the agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The algorithmic accountability review board shall grant an extension for the continued use of a system if the agency has established a reasonable timeline for completion of the algorithmic accountability report and there is no apparent likelihood of bias regarding the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The algorithmic accountability review board must report annually on agency compliance with this subsection and any extensions granted under this subsection. The report must be made available to the public.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public agency intending to newly develop or procure an automated decision system for use between the effective date of this section and January 1, 2026, must as a condition of use of such system, at least one month prior to procurement of, or if internally developed, implementation of such a system produce and file with the office an algorithmic accountability report for that system as described in subsection (4) of this section. In addition to using information already available to an agency, the agency shall conduct reasonable investigatory due diligence including, but not limited to, inquiring with a system provider as to whether studies have been conducted and requesting copies of any studies. For systems that involve high risk pursuant to the prioritization framework, the algorithmic accountability report must include an evaluation of accuracy and bias by a qualified independent third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agency intending to develop or procure an automated decision system for implementation after January 1, 2026, must, as a condition of use of such automated decision system, submit an algorithmic accountability report as described in subsection (4) of this section and obtain a finding by the algorithmic accountability review board pursuant to (d) of this subsection. In addition to using information already available to an agency, the agency shall conduct reasonable investigatory due diligence including, but not limited to, inquiring of a system provider if studies have been conducted and requesting copies of any studies. For systems that involve high risk pursuant to the prioritization framework, the algorithmic accountability report must include an evaluation of accuracy and bias by a qualified independent third party.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The office must post the algorithmic accountability reports on their public website and invite public comment on the algorithmic accountability report for a period of no less than 30 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The algorithmic accountability review board may adopt scoring criteria for determining whether the agency's algorithmic accountability report reasonably shows that the automated decision system meets the minimum standards set forth in section 4 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After receiving public comment, the algorithmic accountability review board must review the algorithmic accountability report and comments received to determine whether the agency's algorithmic accountability report fails to reasonably show that the automated decision system meets the minimum standards set forth in section 4 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the basis of its review of an algorithmic accountability report, the algorithmic accountability review board shall find that the algorithmic accountability report: (i) Reasonably demonstrates that the system meets the minimum standards set forth in section 4 of this act; or (ii) fails, by stated fact or by omission, to show that the system meets the minimum standards set forth in section 4 of the act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report of a failure to meet the minimum standards of section 4 of this act must provide a reasonably detailed description from the algorithmic accountability review board of the reasons for the finding and may, but is not required to be, accompanied by a statement by the algorithmic accountability review board of what further information, or changes, or both may be necessary to the content of the algorithmic accountability report or operation of the automated decision system that could result in a finding that the agency's algorithmic accountability report reasonably shows that the automated decision system meets the minimum standards of section 4 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following a finding that the agency's algorithmic accountability report fails to show that an automated decision system meets the minimum standards of section 4 of this act, the applicable agency shall be entitled to revise the information provided, the system, or the procedures for use of the system and to submit a revised algorithmic accountability report to the algorithmic accountability review board for review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All findings and reports of the algorithmic accountability review board regarding whether a system meets the minimum requirements of section 4 of this act shall be posted on the office's website, and a copy of any reports finding a failure to meet the minimum requirements of section 4 of this act shall be independently transmitted to the legislature and the governor.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2026, agencies shall conduct an annual audit on automated decision systems that have legal effects on people to ensure that they do not have differential effects on subpopulations that result over time and report to the algorithmic accountability review board any findings. The report must include, at minimum:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the automated decision system has complied with the terms of its approved algorithmic accountability report;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions of any known or reasonably suspected violations of any report policies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any systematic issues, such as bias and disproportionate impacts on marginalized or vulnerable communities, raised by use of automated decision systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations, if any, relating to revisions to the automated decision system algorithmic accountability report.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-8">Section 8 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any person who is injured by a material violation of this chapter may institute proceedings against the public agency deploying the automated decision system in a court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or declaratory relief, or both, to compel compliance with this chapter and all relief available in law or equity with respect to section 9 of this act, and in either event if successful shall be entitled to recover their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>
<h2 id="section-9">Section 9 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9">¶</a></h2>
<p>Except to the extent an automated decision system utilizes a criterion specifically mandated by state or federal law or regulation, it is an unfair practice under this section for any automated decision system to discriminate against an individual, or to treat an individual less favorably than another, in whole or in part, on the basis of one or more factors enumerated in RCW 49.60.010. For the purposes of this section, &quot;automated decision system&quot; has the same meaning as defined in section 2 of this act.</p>
<h2 id="section-11">Section 11 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.</p>
