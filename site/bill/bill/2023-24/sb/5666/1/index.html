<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature intends to address the critical lack of affordable housing options for students attending institutions of higher education in the state. Surveys conducted by the Washington student achievement council found that 34 percent of Washington college students reported experiencing housing insecurity and 11 percent reported experiencing homelessness in the past year. The legislature recognizes that the high cost of housing is a barrier to access and success for many students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds. The legislature aims to promote equitable access to higher education by funding the research and design of affordable housing programs for students attending higher education institutions in the state. The legislature further recognizes that to strategically eliminate housing insecurity as a barrier for low-income students, resources are needed to properly design affordable housing programs tailored to each institution's unique needs. It is the belief of the legislature that the programs this research produces will have a positive impact on the education and well-being of students in the state and will contribute to the long-term economic and social prosperity of the state as a whole.</p>
