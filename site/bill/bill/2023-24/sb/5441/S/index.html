<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes public school instruction should include the study of the role and contributions of men, women, indigenous peoples, Black Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, European Americans, multiracial individuals, LGBTQIA2S+ Americans, persons with disabilities, and members of other ethnic and cultural groups. This study is especially important in the social sciences, which should seek to understand the economic, political, and social development of Washington state and the United States and should emphasize portraying the role of these groups in contemporary society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature believes that an inclusive education helps students of all backgrounds, cultures, and identities connect with the instructional materials and helps all students feel a sense of belonging at school. Further, the legislature has confidence that students who do not share these backgrounds, cultures, and identities get a more complete and well-rounded education of history and society when it is inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that inclusive curricula have been shown to often improve the mental health, academic performance, attendance rates, and graduation rates of marginalized communities. For example, a 2017 study showed a 38 percent to 306 percent increase in the fluency rates of African American second grade children when they read culturally relevant stories. Children felt more motivated and interested when reading stories that reflected them. Additionally, students in schools with inclusive curricula have also reported hearing fewer homophobic remarks and in schools with inclusive curricula, less than half of students felt unsafe at school due to their sexual orientation compared to the two-thirds of students who attended schools without inclusive curricula.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to promote and support the development and adoption of curricula that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive through regional inclusive curricula coordinators, youth advisory councils, and an open educational resource database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, each educational service district must designate a regional inclusive curricula coordinator with the following duties:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Help school districts ensure that diversity, equity, and inclusion are interwoven throughout curricula and not treated as stand-alone topics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate school district use of a bias screening tool to review instructional materials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as a resource to the instructional materials committee established under RCW 28A.320.230 for school districts within the educational service district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate with and assist any school districts that are leading efforts on diversity, equity, or inclusion, the office of the superintendent of public instruction, and the Washington state office of equity established in RCW 43.06D.020;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support professional development efforts regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion including the professional learning days required by RCW 28A.415.445; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help school districts improve school and classroom culture and climate using inclusive instructional materials.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, each educational service district must establish a regional youth advisory council for inclusive curricula and equity.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">

<p>The council must consist of at least one student representative from each school district within the educational service district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students may be selected to serve on the council by staff recommendation, application, or interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The council must consist of students with diverse backgrounds including backgrounds that include diversity as it relates to sex, race, religion, national origin, connection with the military, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, disability, socioeconomic status, and involvement in the community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section prevents any school district from establishing its own youth advisory council for inclusive curricula and equity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this section, &quot;diversity,&quot; &quot;equity,&quot; and &quot;inclusion&quot; have the same meanings as in RCW 28A.415.443.</p>

The office of the superintendent of public instruction must consult with the Washington state office of equity established in RCW 43.06D.020 and any other relevant state agencies when creating the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The open educational resource database must include resources that include the histories, contributions, and perspectives of historically marginalized and underrepresented groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The open educational resource database must facilitate the free use, adaptation, and sharing of these resources among school districts and certificated staff.</p>
