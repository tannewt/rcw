<p>Which maternity care services are considered preventive services under section 2713 of the federal public health service act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 300gg et seq.) and implementing federal regulations in effect on the effective date of this section and are therefore exempt from cost sharing;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The office of the insurance commissioner shall submit a report on the findings and cost estimate to the appropriate committees of the legislature by July 1, 2024.
