<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the Washington state parks and recreation commission oversees a robust boating safety education program that has been successful in educating the motor boating public to increase safety on the water. The legislature further finds that recent data on Washington boating fatalities show that there are more reportable fatalities on human-powered watercraft than on other types of vessels. Therefore, the legislature intends to reduce the risk of accidents and fatalities among recreational operators of human-powered watercraft by establishing a new safety education program for human-powered watercraft.</p>
