<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that efficient and effective siting and permitting of new clean energy projects throughout Washington is necessary to: Fight climate change and achieve the state's greenhouse gas emission limits; improve air quality; grow family-wage clean energy jobs and innovative clean energy businesses that provide economic benefits across the state; and make available secure domestic sources of the clean energy products needed to transition off fossil fuels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to: Enable more efficient and effective siting and permitting of clean energy projects with policies and investments that protect the environment, overburdened communities, and tribal rights, interests, and resources, including cultural resources; bring benefits to the communities that host clean energy projects; and facilitate the rapid transition to clean energy that is required to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on Washington's people and places. There is no single solution for improved siting and permitting processes. Rather, a variety of efforts and investments will help bring together state, local, tribal, and federal governments, communities, workers, clean energy project developers, and others to succeed in this essential task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient and effective siting and permitting will benefit from early and meaningful community and tribal engagement, and from up-front planning including identification of least-conflict sites, and nonproject environmental review that identifies measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate project impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating the principles and strategies identified in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section, the legislature intends to invest in, facilitate, and require better coordinated, faster environmental review and permitting decisions by state and local governments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support efficient, effective siting and permitting of clean energy projects through a variety of interventions, including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Establishing an interagency clean energy siting coordinating council to improve siting and permitting of clean energy projects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a designation for clean energy projects of statewide significance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a fully coordinated permit process for clean energy projects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving processes for review of clean energy projects under the state environmental policy act;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring preparation of separate nonproject environmental impact statements for green electrolytic and renewable hydrogen projects and colocated battery energy storage facilities, onshore utility-scale wind energy projects and colocated battery energy storage facilities, and for solar energy projects and colocated battery energy storage facilities, with the goal of preparing these nonproject reviews by June 30, 2025; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring the Washington State University energy program to complete by June 30, 2025, a least-conflict siting process for pumped storage projects in Washington.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>The coordinating council shall provide an annual report beginning October 1, 2024, to the governor and the appropriate committees of the legislature summarizing: Progress on efficient, effective, and responsible siting and permitting of clean energy projects; areas of additional work, including where clean energy project siting and permitting outcomes are not broadly recognized as efficient, effective, or responsible; resource needs; and any needed policy changes to help achieve the deployment of clean energy necessary to meet the state's statutory greenhouse gas emissions limits, chapter 70A.45 RCW, and the clean energy transformation act requirements, chapter 19.405 RCW, and to support achieving the state energy strategy adopted by the department of commerce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coordinating council shall:</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Carry out an evaluation of state agency siting and permitting processes for clean energy projects and related federal and state regulatory requirements, including the energy facility site evaluation council permitting process authorized in chapter 80.50 RCW;</p>

The department of ecology shall lead this effort and engage with federal agencies and local governments to explore inclusion of federal and local permit applications as part of the consolidated application. The department may design a single consolidated application for multiple clean energy project types, may design separate applications for individual clean energy technologies, or may design an application for related resources. The department of ecology shall provide an update on its development of consolidated permit applications for clean energy projects to the governor and legislature by December 31, 2024. The consolidated permit application process must be available, but not required, for clean energy projects.

c. Explore development of a consolidated permit for clean energy projects. The department of ecology shall lead this effort and explore options including a clean energy project permit that consolidates department of ecology permits only, or that consolidates permits from multiple state and local agencies. The permit structure must identify criteria or conditions that must be met for projects to use the consolidated permit. The department of ecology may analyze criteria or conditions as part of a nonproject review under chapter 43.21C RCW. The department of ecology shall update the legislature on its evaluation of consolidated permit options and make recommendations by October 1, 2024.

<p>The prohibitions on application requirements under this section apply only to a person who, prior to commencing the activities specified in subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section, has inquired with the department of archaeology and historic preservation to obtain information on the probability or existence of tribal cultural resources, archaeological sites, and sacred sites within the potential site area. The department of archaeology and historic preservation must provide information to the person carrying out activities described in subsection (1) of this section regarding the federally recognized Indian tribes that would need to be contacted and that agencies would need to offer consultation to in the event that any project development permit applications were to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="section-306">Section 306 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-306">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Washington State University energy program shall conduct a least-conflict pumped storage siting process for Washington state, to support expanded capacity to store intermittently produced renewable energy such as from wind and solar, as part of the state's transition from fossil fuel to 100 percent clean energy. The Washington State University energy program may decide to include within the process's scope the colocation of pumped storage with wind or solar energy generation. The goal of the process is to identify areas where there is the least amount of potential conflict in the siting of pumped storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In carrying out this process, the Washington State University energy program shall provide ample opportunities for the engagement of federally recognized Indian tribes and stakeholders that self-identify as interested in participating in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington State University energy program must develop and make available a map and associated GIS data layers, highlighting areas identified through the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any information provided by tribes will help to inform the map product, but the Washington State University energy program may not include sensitive tribal information, as identified by federally recognized Indian tribes, in the publicly available map or GIS data layers. The siting process and creation of the map under this section does not supplant the need for project developers to conduct early and individual outreach to federally recognized Indian tribes. The Washington State University energy program must take precautions to prevent disclosure of any sensitive tribal information it receives during the process, consistent with RCW 42.56.300.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The least-conflict pumped storage process must be completed by June 30, 2025.</p>
</li>
</ol>
