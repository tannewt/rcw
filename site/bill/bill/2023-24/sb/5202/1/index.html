<h2 id="section-101">Section 101 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-101">¶</a></h2>
<p>This act may be known and cited as the Washington housing crisis response act.</p>
<h2 id="section-102">Section 102 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-102">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the state of Washington is facing a severe housing shortage that impacts the ability of many Washingtonians to obtain and maintain safe, stable, and affordable housing. The legislature recognizes that multiple factors contribute to the housing crisis, and that the combination of those factors has resulted in a housing deficit of more than 50,000 units for over a decade. The legislature finds that the deficit of new housing necessary to accommodate our growing population was 81,400 units in 2021. The legislature finds that every $100 increase in rent is associated with a 9 percent increase in homelessness, and that 40 percent of Washington households are spending more than 35 percent of their income on rent. The legislature finds that, to keep up with population projections, the state of Washington will need to construct an additional 1,000,000 housing units by 2040. The legislature finds that in order to meet the growing need for new housing, and to address the backlog of housing construction necessary to serve the current population, the state must make significant investments in housing. These investments include emergency, transitional, permanent supportive, permanent, and market rate housing to meet the diverse needs of all Washingtonians in every corner of the state. The legislature finds that a significant number of individuals facing housing instability or homelessness also have behavioral health needs that are not fully supported or addressed. The legislature recognizes behavioral health treatment capacity is essential to increasing and maintaining housing access and stability for all Washingtonians, including those with mental health and substance use conditions. The legislature intends to support these needs by issuing bonds to provide new money for capital programs and projects that are critical to addressing the state's housing crisis.</p>
