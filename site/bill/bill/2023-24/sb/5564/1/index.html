<p>The Washington missing persons reward account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. Moneys from legislative appropriations and transfers, federal funds, public or private donations, gifts, and grants, and any other lawful source may be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the purposes of section 1 of this act, including the attorney general's administrative costs.

The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. When the attorney general determines that the balance of the account is insufficient to ensure the payment of rewards, the attorney general must notify the office of financial management, and the chairs and ranking members of the house appropriations committee and the senate ways and means committee.</p>
