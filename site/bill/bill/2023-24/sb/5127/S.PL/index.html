<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature recognizes the important public interest in maintaining an open and transparent government and the critically important role that our public records act plays in ensuring the people of Washington have access to public records maintained by state and local agencies with narrow exemptions. The legislature recognizes that protecting the personal information of our minor students is also of critical importance, especially when disclosure of that personal information could potentially jeopardize the physical or mental health and safety of a student. While current state law also acknowledges the importance of protecting a student's privacy by providing an exemption for personal information in records maintained on a student's behalf, the legislature notes that there have been instances where information has been released from records held by schools that contains personal information about a student or related to a student and the release allows the student to be identified. The legislature intends to provide additional clarity in this narrow situation involving the disclosure of personal information related to a student that may be found in a nonstudent record. This clarity is intended to ensure school districts understand that they have the ability to protect a student's privacy and redact personal information related to a student regardless of the type of record that the information is found in.</p>
