<ol>
<li>Any physical improvement to single-family dwellings upon real property, including constructing an accessory dwelling unit, whether attached to or within the single-family dwelling or as a detached unit on the same real property, shall be exempt from taxation for the three assessment years subsequent to the completion of the improvement to the extent that the improvement represents 30 percent or less of the value of the original structure. A taxpayer desiring to obtain the exemption granted by this section must file notice of his or her intention to construct the improvement prior to the improvement being made on forms prescribed by the department of revenue and furnished to the taxpayer by the county assessor. The exemption in this subsection cannot be claimed more than once in a five-year period.</li>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The improvement represents 30 percent or less of the value of the original structure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The taxpayer demonstrates that the unit is maintained as a rental property for low-income households. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;low-income household&quot; means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is at or below 60 percent of the median household income adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Rent charged to a tenant does not exceed more than 30 percent of the tenant's monthly income.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An exemption granted under this subsection (2) may continue for as long as the exempted accessory dwelling unit is leased to a low-income household.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Collect a fee from the taxpayer to cover the costs of administering this subsection (2);</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 1, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (section 1 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>One intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a); and</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any data collected by the state.</p>
