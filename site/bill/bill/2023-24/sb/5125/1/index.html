<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that reducing barriers to wealth building activities is a vital strategy in combating persistent poverty and promoting economic resilience for Washingtonians. In 2020, nearly half of Washington newborns were born into households qualifying for medicaid, a key poverty indicator. For those born into poverty there are lifelong impacts including lower rates of homeownership, educational attainment, and entrepreneurship which interfere with their ability to obtain financial stability.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that Washington has established that investing in pathways out of poverty, including housing, higher education, and economic development, is an essential function of government to cultivate thriving and economically independent individuals and communities. Yet barriers, specifically capital barriers, continue to make these foundations for wealth building unattainable for those born without sufficient financial means.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds the office of the state treasurer convened the Washington future fund committee to study wealth inequities in Washington, analyze the Washington future fund and other &quot;baby bonds&quot; investment models, and provide recommendations on program implementation to the legislature. Based on the committee's findings, the legislature concludes that the Washington future fund program begins to address the aforementioned opportunity deficit by providing Washingtonians who were born into and experience persistent poverty the seed capital to invest in themselves and their communities by purchasing a home, pursuing education, or starting a small business.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to establish the Washington future fund program to reduce the capital barriers inhibiting the potential for those born into poverty to alter their financial future.</p>
