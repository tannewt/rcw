<li>
<p>In an action to partition real property under chapter 7.52 RCW, the court shall determine whether the property is heirs property.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, if the court determines that the property that is the subject of a partition action is heirs property, the court shall determine the fair market value of the property by ordering an appraisal pursuant to subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all cotenants have agreed to the value of the property or to another method of valuation, the court shall adopt that value or the value produced by the agreed method of valuation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court determines that the evidentiary value of an appraisal is outweighed by the cost of the appraisal, the court, after an evidentiary hearing, shall determine the fair market value of the property and send notice to the parties of the value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders an appraisal, the court shall appoint a disinterested real estate appraiser licensed in this state to determine the fair market value of the property assuming sole ownership of the fee simple estate. On completion of the appraisal, the appraiser shall file a sworn or verified appraisal with the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an appraisal is conducted pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, not later than 10 days after the appraisal is filed, the court shall send notice to each party with a known address, stating:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The appraised fair market value of the property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the appraisal is available at the clerk's office; and</p>

In addition to the court-ordered appraisal, the court may consider any other evidence of value offered by a party.</p>

<p>After a hearing under subsection (6) of this section, but before considering the merits of the partition action, the court shall determine the fair market value of the property and send notice to the parties of the value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-107">Section 107 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-107">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If any cotenant requested partition by sale, after the determination of value under section 106 of this act, the court shall send notice to the parties that any cotenant except a cotenant that requested partition by sale may buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not later than 45 days after the notice is sent under subsection (1) of this section, any cotenant except a cotenant that requested partition by sale may give notice to the court that it elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purchase price for each of the interests of a cotenant that requested partition by sale is the value of the entire parcel determined under section 106 of this act multiplied by the cotenant's fractional ownership of the entire parcel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After expiration of the period in subsection (2) of this section, the following rules apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If only one cotenant elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale, the court shall notify all the parties of that fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If more than one cotenant elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale, the court shall allocate the right to buy those interests among the electing cotenants based on each electing cotenant's existing fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total existing fractional ownership of all cotenants electing to buy and send notice to all the parties of that fact and of the price to be paid by each electing cotenant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no cotenant elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale, the court shall send notice to all the parties of that fact and resolve the partition action under section 108 (1) and (2) of this act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court sends notice to the parties under subsection (4)(a) or (b) of this section, the court shall set a date, not sooner than 60 days after the date the notice was sent, by which electing cotenants must pay their apportioned price into the court. After this date, the following rules apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If all electing cotenants timely pay their apportioned price into court, the court shall issue an order reallocating all the interests of the cotenants and disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no electing cotenant timely pays its apportioned price, the court shall resolve the partition action under section 108 (1) and (2) of this act as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one or more but not all of the electing cotenants fail to pay their apportioned price on time, the court, on motion, shall give notice to the electing cotenants that paid their apportioned price of the interest remaining and the price for all that interest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not later than 20 days after the court gives notice pursuant to subsection (5)(c) of this section, any cotenant that paid may elect to purchase all of the remaining interest by paying the entire price into the court. After the 20-day period, the following rules apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If only one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall issue an order reallocating the remaining interest to that cotenant. The court shall issue promptly an order reallocating the interests of all of the cotenants and disburse the amounts held by it to the persons entitled to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall resolve the partition action under section 108 (1) and (2) of this act as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If more than one cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall reapportion the remaining interest among those paying cotenants, based on each paying cotenant's original fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total original fractional ownership of all cotenants that paid the entire price for the remaining interest. The court shall issue promptly an order reallocating all of the cotenants' interests, disburse the amounts held by it to the persons entitled to them, and promptly refund any excess payment held by the court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not later than 45 days after the court sends notice to the parties pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, any cotenant entitled to buy an interest under this section may request the court to authorize the sale as part of the pending action of the interests of cotenants named as defendants and served with the complaint but that did not appear in the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court receives a timely request under subsection (7) of this section, the court, after hearing, may deny the request or authorize the requested additional sale on such terms as the court determines are fair and reasonable, subject to the following limitations:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A sale authorized under this subsection may occur only after the purchase prices for all interests subject to sale under subsections (1) through (6) of this section have been paid into court and those interests have been reallocated among the cotenants as provided in those subsections; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purchase price for the interest of a nonappearing cotenant is based on the court's determination of value under section 106 of this act.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-108">Section 108 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-108">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If all the interests of all cotenants that requested partition by sale are not purchased by other cotenants pursuant to section 107 of this act, or if after conclusion of the buyout under section 107 of this act, a cotenant remains that has requested partition in kind, the court shall order partition in kind unless the court, after consideration of the factors listed in section 109 of this act, finds that partition in kind will result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group. In considering whether to order partition in kind, the court shall approve a request by two or more parties to have their individual interests aggregated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court does not order partition in kind under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall order partition by sale pursuant to section 110 of this act or, if no cotenant requested partition by sale, the court shall dismiss the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders partition in kind pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the court may require that one or more cotenants pay one or more other cotenants amounts so that the payments, taken together with the value of the in-kind distributions to the cotenants, will make the partition in kind just and proportionate in value to the fractional interests held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders partition in kind, the court shall allocate to the cotenants that are unknown, unlocatable, or the subject of a default judgment, if their interests were not bought out pursuant to section 107 of this act, a part of the property representing the combined interests of these cotenants as determined by the court and this part of the property shall remain undivided.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In determining under section 108(1) of this act whether partition in kind would result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group, the court shall consider the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Whether the heirs property practicably can be divided among the cotenants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether partition in kind would apportion the property in such a way that the aggregate fair market value of the parcels resulting from the division would be materially less than the value of the property if it were sold as a whole, taking into account the condition under which a court-ordered sale likely would occur;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence of the collective duration of ownership or possession of the property by a cotenant and one or more predecessors in title or predecessors in possession to the cotenant who are or were relatives of the cotenant or each other;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cotenant's sentimental attachment to the property, including any attachment arising because the property has ancestral or other unique or special value to the cotenant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lawful use being made of the property by a cotenant and the degree to which the cotenant would be harmed if the cotenant could not continue the same use of the property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The degree to which the cotenants have contributed their pro rata share of the property taxes, insurance, and other expenses associated with maintaining ownership of the property or have contributed to the physical improvement, maintenance, or upkeep of the property; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other relevant factor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may not consider any one factor in subsection (1) of this section to be dispositive without weighing the totality of all relevant factors and circumstances.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="section-110">Section 110 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-110">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the court orders a sale of heirs property, the sale must be an open market sale unless the court finds that a sale by sealed bids or an auction would be more economically advantageous and in the best interest of the cotenants as a group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders an open market sale and the parties, not later than 10 days after the entry of the order, agree on a real estate broker licensed in this state to offer the property for sale, the court shall appoint the broker and establish a reasonable commission. If the parties do not agree on a broker, the court shall appoint a disinterested real estate broker licensed in this state to offer the property for sale and shall establish a reasonable commission. The broker shall offer the property for sale in a commercially reasonable manner at a price no lower than the determination of value and on the terms and conditions established by the court.</p>

<p>Redetermine the value of the property and order that the property continue to be offered for an additional time; or</p>

<p>Order that the property be sold by sealed bids or at an auction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court orders a sale by sealed bids or an auction, the court shall set terms and conditions of the sale. If the court orders an auction, the auction must be conducted under chapter 7.52 RCW.</p>

<p>If a purchaser is entitled to a share of the proceeds of the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a credit against the price in an amount equal to the purchaser's share of the proceeds.</p>
