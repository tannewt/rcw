<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a unique set of challenges and circumstances that have tested the K-12 education system. Due to reduced instructional time, educational inequities, and the inability to access technology and educational services, many students have suffered learning loss and a disruption to their educational experience. As a result, the legislature finds that an expanded school calendar will help students address learning loss.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In order for students to have the opportunity to develop the basic education knowledge and skills under RCW 28A.150.210, school districts must provide instruction of sufficient quantity and quality and give students the opportunity to complete graduation requirements that are intended to prepare them for postsecondary education, gainful employment, and citizenship. The program established under this section shall be the minimum instructional program of basic education offered by school districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each school district shall make available to students the following minimum instructional offering each school year:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At least 1,110 instructional hours for students enrolled in grades nine through 12 and at least 1,028 instructional hours for students in grades one through eight, all of which may be calculated by a school district using a district-wide annual average of instructional hours over grades one through 12; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For students enrolled in kindergarten, at least 1,028 instructional hours .</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The instructional program of basic education provided by each school district shall include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Instruction in the state learning standards under RCW 28A.655.070;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instruction that provides students the opportunity to complete 24 credits for high school graduation, beginning with the graduating class of 2019 or as otherwise provided in RCW 28A.230.090. Course distribution requirements may be established by the state board of education under RCW 28A.230.090;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the state learning standards include a requirement of languages other than English, the requirement may be met by students receiving instruction in one or more American Indian languages;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplemental instruction and services for students who are not meeting academic standards through the learning assistance program under RCW 28A.165.005 through 28A.165.065;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplemental instruction and services for eligible and enrolled students and exited students whose primary language is other than English through the transitional bilingual instruction program under RCW 28A.180.010 through 28A.180.080;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The opportunity for an appropriate education at public expense as defined by RCW 28A.155.020 for all eligible students with disabilities as defined in RCW 28A.155.020; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programs for highly capable students under RCW 28A.185.010 through 28A.185.030.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require individual students to attend school for any particular number of hours per day or to take any particular courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Each school district's kindergarten through 12th grade basic educational program shall be accessible to all students who are five years of age, as provided by RCW 28A.225.160, and less than 21 years of age and shall consist of a minimum of 185 school days per school year in such grades as are conducted by a school district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools administering the Washington kindergarten inventory of developing skills may use up to three school days at the beginning of the school year to meet with parents and families as required in the parent involvement component of the inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of students who are graduating from high school, a school district may schedule the last five school days of the 185-day school year for noninstructional purposes including, but not limited to, the observance of graduation and early release from school upon the request of a student. All such students may be claimed as a full‑time equivalent student to the extent they could otherwise have been so claimed for the purposes of RCW 28A.150.250 and 28A.150.260. Any hours scheduled by a school district for noninstructional purposes during the last five school days for such students shall count toward the instructional hours requirement in subsection (2)(a) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to RCW 28A.150.276, nothing in this section precludes a school district from enriching the instructional program of basic education, such as offering additional instruction or providing additional services, programs, or activities that the school district determines to be appropriate for the education of the school district's students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state board of education shall adopt rules to implement and ensure compliance with the program requirements imposed by this section, RCW 28A.150.250 and 28A.150.260, and such related supplemental program approval requirements as the state board may establish.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In addition to waivers authorized under RCW 28A.300.750, the superintendent of public instruction, in accordance with the criteria in subsection (2) of this section and criteria adopted by the state board of education under subsection (3) of this section, may grant waivers of the requirement for a 185-day school year under RCW 28A.150.220 to school districts that propose to operate one or more schools on a flexible calendar for purposes of economy and efficiency as provided in this section. The requirement under RCW 28A.150.220 that school districts offer minimum instructional hours may not be waived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A school district seeking a waiver under this section must submit an application to the superintendent of public instruction that includes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A proposed calendar for the school day and school year that demonstrates how the instructional hour requirement will be maintained;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An explanation and estimate of the economies and efficiencies to be gained from compressing the instructional hours into fewer than 185 days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An explanation of how monetary savings from the proposal will be redirected to support student learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A summary of comments received at one or more public hearings on the proposal and how concerns will be addressed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An explanation of the impact on students who rely upon free and reduced-price school child nutrition services and the impact on the ability of the child nutrition program to operate an economically independent program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An explanation of the impact on employees in education support positions and the ability to recruit and retain employees in education support positions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An explanation of the impact on students whose parents work during the missed school day; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other information that the superintendent of public instruction may request to assure that the proposed flexible calendar will not adversely affect student learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state board of education shall adopt rules establishing the criteria to evaluate waiver requests under this section. A waiver may be effective for up to three years and may be renewed for subsequent periods of three or fewer years. After each school year in which a waiver has been granted under this section, the superintendent of public instruction must analyze empirical evidence to determine whether the reduction is affecting student learning. If the superintendent of public instruction determines that student learning is adversely affected, the school district must discontinue the flexible calendar as soon as possible but not later than the beginning of the next school year after the superintendent of public instruction's determination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction may grant waivers authorized under this section to 10 or fewer school districts with student populations of less than 500 students. Of the 10 waivers that may be granted, two must be reserved for districts with student populations of less than 150 students.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall have the authority to make rules and regulations which establish the terms and conditions for allowing school districts to receive state basic education moneys as provided in RCW 28A.150.250 when said districts are unable to fulfill for one or more schools as officially scheduled the requirement of a full school year of 185 days or the annual average total instructional hour offering imposed by RCW 28A.150.220 and 28A.150.260 due to one or more of the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An unforeseen natural event, including, but not necessarily limited to, a fire, flood, explosion, storm, earthquake, epidemic, or volcanic eruption that has the direct or indirect effect of rendering one or more school district facilities unsafe, unhealthy, inaccessible, or inoperable; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unforeseen mechanical failure or an unforeseen action or inaction by one or more persons, including negligence and threats, that (i) is beyond the control of both a school district board of directors and its employees and (ii) has the direct or indirect effect of rendering one or more school district facilities unsafe, unhealthy, inaccessible, or inoperable. Such actions, inactions or mechanical failures may include, but are not necessarily limited to, arson, vandalism, riots, insurrections, bomb threats, bombings, delays in the scheduled completion of construction projects, and the discontinuance or disruption of utilities such as heating, lighting and water: PROVIDED, That an unforeseen action or inaction shall not include any labor dispute between a school district board of directors and any employee of the school district.</p>

<p>A condition is foreseeable for the purposes of this subsection to the extent a reasonably prudent person would have anticipated prior to August first of the preceding school year that the condition probably would occur during the ensuing school year because of the occurrence of an event or a circumstance which existed during such preceding school year or a prior school year. A board of directors of a school district is deemed for the purposes of this subsection to have knowledge of events and circumstances which are a matter of common knowledge within the school district and of those events and circumstances which can be discovered upon prudent inquiry or inspection.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The superintendent of public instruction shall make every effort to reduce the amount of paperwork required in administration of this chapter and RCW 28A.160.150 through 28A.160.210, 28A.300.035, 28A.300.170, and 28A.500.010; to simplify the application, monitoring and evaluation processes used; to eliminate all duplicative requests for information from local school districts; and to make every effort to integrate and standardize information requests for other state education acts and federal aid to education acts administered by the superintendent of public instruction so as to reduce paperwork requirements and duplicative information requests.</li>
