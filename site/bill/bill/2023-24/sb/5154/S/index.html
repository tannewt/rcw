<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that packaging designs and materials have changed and the way Washington's residents use, consume, and manage materials when no longer wanted has also changed significantly in recent years. These shifts have created unintended consequences, such as the deterioration of ecosystems regionally and worldwide, as well as increased levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change, and reductions in human well-being, especially for the most vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that convenient and environmentally sound extended producer responsibility programs that include collecting, transporting, reusing, and recycling, or the proper end-of-life management of unwanted products help protect Washington's environment and the health of state residents. In general, the state's waste management hierarchy establishes that products should be managed in a manner where a priority is placed on prevention, waste reduction, source reduction, reuse, and recycling over energy recovery and landfill disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many residents, particularly those who live in rural areas and in multifamily residences, do not have access to convenient or affordable curbside recycling, and must rely on taking recyclables to drop box locations, and that extended producer responsibility programs could make curbside recycling available and affordable for most people in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also finds that the department of ecology was directed, through an independent consultant, to study how plastic packaging is managed in the state, assess various policy options, and that the study recommendations included establishing an extended producer responsibility policy for all consumer packaging and paper products with a framework that makes producers responsible for achieving specific management and environmental outcomes for the packaging and paper products they supply into Washington state, as well as recommending that postconsumer recycled content requirements and a deposit return system for beverage containers be established.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the legislature finds extended producer responsibility policies designed to cover all consumer packaging and paper materials offer the potential for greater economies of scale and operational efficiencies than could be achieved under a policy applied only to a subset of materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to require that extended producer responsibility programs, including the achievement of recycling rates, are implemented by and for producers of consumer packaging and paper products in a manner that involves producers in material management from design concept to end-of-life. These programs incentivize innovation and research to develop more efficient recycling technologies and minimize environmental impacts of the packaging and paper products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also intended that these programs be responsibly managed, so that covered products are handled and accounted for from the point of collection through the final destination in a way that benefits the environment and minimizes risks to public health and worker health and safety. It is intended that these programs build and expand on the existing waste and recycling system's infrastructure and reliance on the role of local governments and the utilities and transportation commission in solid waste management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the intent of the legislature that producers increase the use of postconsumer recycled content in their products, to achieve the goals in RCW 70A.520.010(2), in order to create strong markets for recycled materials and achieve environmental benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that, through design and innovation, producers will reduce the use and climate impact of consumer packaging and paper products, increase the use of postconsumer recycled content, and make all packaging reusable, recyclable, or compostable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, it is the intent of the legislature that Washington should maintain the successful public-private partnership between state, local government, and solid waste and recycling service providers. The legislature does not intend to diminish or displace the primary role of the utilities and transportation commission and local governments in regulating or contracting directly with service providers for the curbside collection of residential recyclables. Local governments maintain their existing authority to collect, contract for collection with solid waste and recycling service providers, or defer to solid waste collection services regulated by the utilities and transportation commission.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the department of ecology was directed, through an independent consultant, to study how plastic packaging is managed in the state, to assess various policy options, and to provide recommendations to achieve certain goals, which included:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Plastic packaging sold into the state is 100 percent recyclable, reusable, or compostable by January 1, 2025;</p>

<li>
<p>Plastic packaging is reduced when possible and optimized to meet the need for it.</p>

<p>The legislature also finds that the study recommendations included establishing an extended producer responsibility policy for all consumer packaging and paper with a framework that makes producers responsible for achieving specific management and environmental outcomes for the consumer packaging they supply into Washington state. In addition, the legislature finds that the study recommends that a deposit return system is an effective way for producers to meet outcomes required by an extended producer responsibility framework.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature further intends that packaging materials be recycled or reused through extended producer responsibility programs, including a deposit return system for qualifying beverage containers. It is the intent of the legislature that extended producer responsibility programs be implemented by and for producers of plastic packaging and other material types so that the design and management of their packaging is accomplished in a manner that ensures minimal environmental impact, involves producers from design concept to end-of-life management, and incentivizes innovation and industry stewardship to minimize environmental impacts.</p>

<p>REUSE AND RECYCLING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS. (1) To meet the reuse and recycling performance requirements established in this section, a distributor responsibility organization must:</p>
<pre><code>a. Demonstrate that all qualifying beverage containers are designed to be reusable or recyclable by January 1, 2031, in accordance with criteria established by the department; and

b. Calculate the reuse sales rate and the redemption rate of qualifying beverage containers and provide the verification to the department as part of the annual reporting requirements. The reuse sales rate is the number of units in reusable packaging sold in a year. For materials reclaimed under a deposit return system, the calculation point for the redemption rate is the number of qualifying beverage containers redeemed statewide by the distributor responsibility organization divided by the number of qualifying beverage containers sold in the state by members of the distributor responsibility organization.

<p>DEPOSIT RETURN SYSTEM. (1) The department shall make a determination of approval of a distributor responsibility organization's plan, or plan update, to operate a deposit return system for qualifying beverage containers based on the criteria in this section:</p>
<pre><code>a. The distributor responsibility organization's registration with the department meets the requirements described in sections 304 and 305 of this act;

b. The distributor responsibility organization presents a plan that imposes a refund value of 10 cents for all qualifying beverage containers covered under the plan;

c. The plan or plan update includes a method for paying the refund value and collecting qualifying beverage containers from consumers, including a plan to provide convenient bulk, bagged returns, and a plan to accept direct, sorted returns at its processing facilities for an additional refund value premium if the containers are returned by organizations certified as nonprofit organizations pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code that are approved by the distributor responsibility organization and serve very low-income individuals who rely on regular container refunds through the deposit return system as a source of daily funds;

d. Includes in the plan a process for annually reporting to the department regarding the names, locations, return volume, cost per container for each partnership, and other services provided through the partnerships described in (c) of this subsection; and

e. Includes a description of how the distributor responsibility organization and the deposit return system will coordinate with other recycling systems and processes, including exploring the potential for colocating facilities as described in section 308 of this act, establishing policies to facilitate the redemption of materials from other recycling pathways as described in section 314 of this act, and providing clear communications about which products are included in the deposit return system as described in section 313 of this act.

<li>
<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, any individual, separate, sealed glass, metal, or plastic bottle or can, except for a carton, foil pouch, drink box, or metal container that requires a tool to be opened, that contains any beverage intended for human consumption and in a quantity of greater than four ounces and less than or equal to one gallon.</p>

<p>In lieu of any other penalties for not achieving the performance criteria in section 306 of this act, should the redemption rate performance requirements described in section 306 of this act not be met, the distributor responsibility organization shall annually calculate the number of containers representing the difference between the redemption rate of qualifying beverage containers and the redemption rate performance requirements described in section 306(2) (a) and (b) of this act, and pay a penalty that is equal to 10 cents times the number of containers representing the difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the sole discretion of the department, if the requirements in (a) of this subsection result in a penalty to be paid by the distributor responsibility organization, the department may alternatively identify priority areas for additional drop-off access to be provided, and the department and the distributor responsibility organization may agree to provide additional access accordingly. If agreement is not reached, the financial penalty in (a) of this subsection must be paid.</p>

<p>The distributor responsibility organization must, at its own cost, provide a convenient bulk drop-off option for bagged qualifying beverage containers at geographically dispersed locations in Washington that sell beverages in qualifying beverage containers, are located a convenient distance from a dealer, or are located at a publicly owned facility. The distributor responsibility organization may not charge customers for this drop-off service and must credit the cost of any required bag purchase back to the customer when the bag is processed. If drop-off bags are made of plastic film, bags must have a minimum 50 percent recycled content and the distributor responsibility organization must be able to demonstrate that waste film from bags is being recycled in the best commercially available manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon launch of the deposit return system, the distributor responsibility organization shall provide at least 270 bag drop sites around the state, with at least one drop site located in each county, and at least one drop site located in each island community served by the Washington state ferries system, distributed by county proportional to the volume of qualifying beverage containers sold in each county. The distributor responsibility organization shall calculate a drop-off capacity formula that is equal to the ratio of drop-off locations to total sales of beverages in qualifying beverage containers represented by the initial deployment of 270 sites, and the number of beverages in qualifying beverage containers sold the year prior to the year the distributor responsibility organization begins operating a deposit return system in Washington. Within two years of the date in which the distributor responsibility organization begins operating a deposit return system, the distributor responsibility organization shall add an additional 10 drop-off locations. The locations of the additional 10 drop-off sites must be agreed upon by the distributor responsibility organization and the department, in consultation with the consumer convenience advisory council established in section 310 of this act, balancing the need for consumer convenience and access in rural counties, small cities, and underserved areas, and data regarding where beverages in qualifying beverage containers are sold. Five years after the distributor responsibility organization is required to provide 280 drop-off locations, and every five years after that, the distributor responsibility organization shall calculate an updated number of drop-off locations required using the drop-off capacity formula. If this calculation determines that the distributor responsibility organization needs to add additional drop-off sites to reach the number required by the capacity formula, the distributor responsibility organization shall provide the department with a list of proposed new locations, equal to the number determined by the drop-off capacity formula, based on input from the consumer convenience advisory council established in section 310 of this act, consideration of consumer convenience, and data regarding where beverage sales occur. The distributor responsibility organization shall make the new drop-off locations available within three years. Drop-off locations may be located at dealers, or any other retail establishment, publicly owned facility, or any other location convenient to consumers but nothing in this chapter may be interpreted to create a legal obligation on the part of dealers either to accept returned qualifying beverage containers or allow a drop-off location to be sited at a dealer. Local governments shall coordinate with the distributor responsibility organization to identify opportunities for the siting of necessary collection infrastructure including, where appropriate, on city and county properties, to help ensure convenient access across the state. All sites must be paid for in full by the distributor responsibility organization. The distributor responsibility organization may provide an alternative access plan for any county that has not reached the required number of drop-off locations and the department may approve an alternative access plan for that county if it deems the alternative access plan for that county to be similarly convenient to consumers as the proportional drop site requirement. The distributor responsibility organization shall pay for the cost of these facilities.</p>

<li>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in a distributor responsibility organization's bylaws or in a contract between a distributor responsibility organization and an individual distributor arranging specifically for the collection of beverage containers sold for the purpose of consumption on premises, any manufacturer, distributor, or importer that fails to pay to a distributor responsibility organization the refund value of qualifying beverage containers included in this chapter is liable to the distributor responsibility organization for treble the unpaid refund value and treble the collection costs incurred by the distributor responsibility organization for any beverage containers that were sold without the refund value of the container being remitted to the distributor responsibility organization.</p>

<li>
<p>Continuing technological changes in methods of manufacture, packaging, and marketing of consumer products, together with the economic and population growth of this state, the rising affluence of its citizens, and its expanding industrial activity have created new and ever-mounting problems involving disposal of garbage, refuse, and solid waste materials resulting from domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traditional methods of disposing of solid wastes in this state are no longer adequate to meet the ever-increasing problem. Improper methods and practices of handling and disposal of solid wastes pollute our land, air and water resources, blight our countryside, adversely affect land values, and damage the overall quality of our environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considerations of natural resource limitations, energy shortages, economics and the environment make necessary the development and implementation of solid waste recovery and/or recycling plans and programs.</p>

<li>
<p>Waste reduction must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. It is therefore necessary to change manufacturing and purchasing practices and waste generation behaviors to reduce the amount of waste that becomes a governmental responsibility.</p>

<li>
<p>Source separation of waste must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. Collection and handling strategies should have, as an ultimate goal, the source separation of all materials with resource value or environmental hazard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It should be the goal of every person and business to minimize their production of wastes and to separate recyclable or hazardous materials from mixed waste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to provide for a waste management infrastructure to fully implement waste reduction and source separation strategies and to process and dispose of remaining wastes in a manner that is environmentally safe and economically sound. It is further the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to monitor the cost-effectiveness and environmental safety of combusting separated waste, processing mixed municipal solid waste, and recycling programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the responsibility of county and city governments to assume primary responsibility for solid waste management and to develop and implement aggressive and effective waste reduction and source separation strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the responsibility of state government to ensure that local governments are providing adequate source reduction and separation opportunities and incentives to all, including persons in both rural and urban areas, and nonresidential waste generators such as commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, recognizing the need to provide flexibility to accommodate differing population densities, distances to and availability of recycling markets, and collection and disposal costs in each community; and to provide county and city governments with adequate technical resources to accomplish this responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the responsibility of producers to help provide for the responsible management of their products.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environmental and economic considerations in solving the state's solid waste management problems requires strong consideration by local governments of regional solutions and intergovernmental cooperation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following priorities for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste are necessary and should be followed in descending order as applicable:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Waste reduction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recycling, with source separation of recyclable materials as the preferred method;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of separated waste;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of mixed municipal solid wastes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the state's goal to achieve a 50 percent recycling rate by 2007.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the state's goal that programs be established to eliminate residential or commercial yard debris in landfills by 2012 in those areas where alternatives to disposal are readily available and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All governmental entities in the state should set an example by implementing aggressive waste reduction and recycling programs at their workplaces and by purchasing products that are made from recycled materials and are recyclable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure the safe and efficient operations of solid waste disposal facilities, it is necessary for operators and regulators of landfills and incinerators to receive training and certification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is necessary to provide adequate funding to all levels of government so that successful waste reduction and recycling programs can be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of stable and expanding markets for recyclable materials is critical to the long-term success of the state's recycling goals. Market development must be encouraged on a state, regional, and national basis to maximize its effectiveness. The state shall assume primary responsibility for the development of a multifaceted market development program to carry out the purposes of chapter 431, Laws of 1989.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an imperative need to anticipate, plan for, and accomplish effective storage, control, recovery, and recycling of discarded tires and other problem wastes with the subsequent conservation of resources and energy.</p>

<h2 id="section-402">Section 402 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-402">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive statewide program for solid waste handling, and solid waste recovery and/or recycling which will prevent land, air, and water pollution and conserve the natural, economic, and energy resources of this state. To this end it is the purpose of this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To assign primary responsibility for adequate solid waste handling to local government, reserving to the state, however, those functions necessary to assure effective programs throughout the state, and sharing with producers' responsibility for the management of their covered products under chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 601 of this act);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide for adequate planning for solid waste handling by local government;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide for the adoption and enforcement of basic minimum performance standards for solid waste handling, including that all sites where recyclable materials are generated and transported from shall provide a separate container for solid waste;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling, to promote consistency in the requirements for such facilities throughout the state, and to ensure that recyclable materials diverted from the waste stream for recycling are routed to facilities in which recycling occurs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide technical and financial assistance to local governments in the planning, development, and conduct of solid waste handling programs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage storage, proper disposal, and recycling of discarded vehicle tires and to stimulate private recycling programs throughout the state; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities and activities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling and to promote consistency in the permitting requirements for such facilities and activities throughout the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that local governments be encouraged to use the expertise of private industry and to contract with private industry to the fullest extent possible to carry out solid waste recovery and/or recycling programs.</p>
