<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2, 3, and 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (sections 2, 3, and 4 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes these tax preferences as ones intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, improve industry competitiveness, and create or retain jobs, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2) (a), (b), and (c).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage green electrolytic hydrogen fuel product research, development, and manufacture in Washington, and to increase the number and wage level of jobs in this industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The number of businesses and employees in this state focused on green electrolytic hydrogen fuel product research, development, or manufacture, including examination of employee wages and benefits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether Washington businesses focused on green electrolytic hydrogen fuel product research, development, and manufacturing in the state have made advancements in green electrolytic hydrogen fuel product technology, which may include examination of the number of patents filed with the United States patent and trademark office, research and development spending, products delivered to market, and any other metrics deemed relevant by the committee; and</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>In computing the tax imposed under this chapter, a credit is allowed for each person for qualified hydrogen fuel product development. For a person who is a manufacturer or processor for hire of hydrogen fuel products, credit may be earned for expenditures occurring after January 1, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The credit is equal to the amount of qualified hydrogen fuel product development expenditures of a person, multiplied by the rate of 1.75 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The credit under this section must be claimed against taxes due for the same calendar year in which the qualified hydrogen fuel product development expenditures are incurred. The credit for each calendar year may not exceed the amount of tax otherwise due under this chapter for the calendar year. Refunds may not be granted in the place of a credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person claiming the credit must file an electronic form prescribed by the department that includes the amount of the credit claimed, an estimate of the anticipated hydrogen fuel product development expenditures during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, an estimate of the taxable amount during the calendar year for which the credit is claimed, and such additional information as the department may prescribe. A person whose reporting period is less than annual must make an adjustment to the total credit claimed for the calendar year using the person's actual hydrogen fuel product development expenditures for the calendar year when the person files its last return for the calendar year for which the credit is claimed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The credit authorized under this section may only be claimed by persons compensating each employee engaged in qualified hydrogen fuel product development at an annualized amount equal to or greater than 125 percent of the per capita personal income of the county from which the employee performs a majority of the employee's employment activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits are available on a first-in-time basis.

In addition, the department must provide written notice to any person who has claimed tax credits in excess of the limitation in this subsection. The notice must indicate the amount of tax due and provide that the tax be paid within 30 days from the date of the notice. The department may not assess penalties and interest as provided in chapter 82.32 RCW on the amount due in the initial notice if the amount due is paid by the due date specified in the notice, or any extension thereof.</p>
