<p>The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Manufacturer's warranty&quot; includes an express warranty issued by the manufacturer of a motor vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Purchase price&quot; includes the total paid for the purchase of the vehicle as listed in the sale agreement, plus any commissions related to financing or finance charges retained by the selling dealer, unused and refundable registration fees, payments made for credit life, accident, health, and damage insurance, refundable portions of service contracts, and the value of a trade-in not applied to the purchase price of the vehicle and not included as an over allowance of value on the trade-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Reasonable allowance for use&quot; is 15 cents for each mile the used motor vehicle has been operated between its sale and the dealer's repurchase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Repurchase price&quot; includes the purchase price, as defined in subsection (2) of this section, less any cash award that was made by the used motor vehicle dealer in an attempt to resolve the dispute and was accepted by the consumer, any refunds or rebates to which the consumer is entitled, the reasonable value of damage to the vehicle after purchase not covered by this section, plus the reasonable costs of towing from point of breakdown up to 30 miles to obtain required repairs or return the vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Used motor vehicle&quot; or &quot;used vehicle,&quot; for the purposes of this chapter only, includes any vehicle driven more than the limited use necessary in moving or road testing a new vehicle prior to delivery to a consumer, including a demonstrator or executive use vehicle, except that it does not include motor homes, vehicles built primarily for off-road use, or any vehicle used primarily for business purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Used motor vehicle dealer&quot; includes any person, firm, association, corporation, or trust, not excluded by RCW 46.70.011(18), buying, selling, listing, exchanging, offering, brokering, leasing with an option to purchase, auctioning, soliciting, or advertising the sale of a used vehicle, or arranging or offering or attempting to solicit or negotiate on behalf of others, a sale, purchase, or exchange of an interest in a used motor vehicle, irrespective of whether the used motor vehicles are owned by that person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>The express warranties required in this section are of the following durations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For a used motor vehicle which, at the time of sale, has been operated less than 40,000 miles, 90 days or 3,750 miles, whichever occurs first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a used motor vehicle which, at the time of sale, has been operated 40,000 miles or more, but less than 80,000 miles, 60 days or 2,500 miles, whichever occurs first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a used motor vehicle which, at the time of sale, has been operated 80,000 miles or more, but less than 125,000 miles, 30 days or 1,250 miles, whichever occurs first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the used motor vehicle's true mileage is not known, the warranty period is determined by the age of the used motor vehicle in the following manner: A used motor vehicle three years old or less shall have a warranty as provided in subsection (1) of this section; a used motor vehicle more than three, but less than six years old, shall have a warranty as provided in subsection (2) of this section; and a used motor vehicle six years old but less than 20 years old shall have a warranty as provided in subsection (3) of this section. A used motor vehicle's age is determined by subtracting the date of first sale, or the model year if unknown, from the date the warranty holder purchased said used vehicle. In calculating time under this subsection, a day on which the warranty is breached is excluded and all subsequent days in which the used motor vehicle fails to conform with the express warranty are also excluded. In calculating distance under this subsection, the miles driven to obtain or in connection with the repair or testing of the used motor vehicle that fails to conform with the express warranty are excluded.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, the express warranty is met if a used motor vehicle is substantially free of any defects that significantly limit the use of the used motor vehicle for the ordinary purpose of transportation on any public highway for the durations set forth in section 2 of this act.

<h2 id="section-4">Section 4 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the used motor vehicle remains subject to a manufacturer's warranty at time of sale, and the warranty has been duly assigned or transferred to the buyer, the duration of the express warranty set forth in section 2 of this act is reduced by the remaining duration of the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Section 5 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the express warranty described in this chapter is breached, the purchaser shall give reasonable notice to the used motor vehicle dealer.

The purchaser's payment(s) for repair(s) described in this section is one-half of the cost of repairs. At no time, however, shall the purchaser's cumulative payments for repair(s) exceed $200, subject to subsection (3) of this section.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the used motor vehicle dealer or its agent fails to repair the same defect after three attempts, the dealer shall accept return of the vehicle from the purchaser and refund the full repurchase price, less a reasonable allowance for use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of the number of defects, if the used motor vehicle is out of service for a total of 45 days during the warranty period, the dealer shall accept return of the vehicle from the consumer and refund the full purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for use. The 45-day period does not include the time from when the defect manifested and when the purchaser notified the used car dealer of same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On September 30, 2023, and on each September 30th thereafter, the attorney general shall calculate an adjusted maximum cumulative payment for repair, reasonable allowance for use, and minimum applicable purchase price by increasing the current year's rates by the rate of inflation. The adjusted maximum rate shall be calculated to the nearest cent using the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, CPI-W, or a successor index, for the 12 months before each September 1st as calculated by the United States department of labor. Each adjustment calculated under this subsection takes effect on the following January 1st.</p>
