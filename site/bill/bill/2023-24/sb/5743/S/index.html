<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the regular legislative session of 2022, the legislature passed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5974 (chapter 182, Laws of 2022), a significant transportation resources bill intended to provide needed transportation funding throughout the state. However, since the enactment of that act, certain drafting errors and omissions were identified within the act resulting in some provisions being enacted contrary to legislative intent. Additionally, some corrective changes were identified that would better conform certain provisions with original legislative intent. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to simply correct manifest drafting errors and omissions and adopt corrective changes in order to conform certain provisions with the original legislative intent of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5974 (chapter 182, Laws of 2022). It is not the intent of the legislature to alter the intended substantive policy enacted in Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5974 (chapter 182, Laws of 2022), but rather to make certain nonsubstantive, corrective changes.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Cities that operate transit systems, county transportation authorities, metropolitan municipal corporations, public transportation benefit areas, high capacity transportation corridor areas, and regional transit authorities may submit an authorizing proposition to the voters and if approved by a majority of persons voting, fix and impose a sales and use tax in accordance with the terms of this chapter, solely for the purpose of providing high capacity transportation service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tax authorized pursuant to this section is in addition to the tax authorized by RCW 82.14.030 and must be collected from those persons who are taxable by the state pursuant to chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW upon the occurrence of any taxable event within the taxing district.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Except for the tax imposed under (b) of this subsection by regional transit authorities that include a county with a population of more than 1,500,000, the maximum rate of such tax must be approved by the voters and may not exceed one percent of the selling price (in the case of a sales tax) or value of the article used (in the case of a use tax). The maximum rate of such tax that may be imposed may not exceed nine-tenths of one percent in any county that imposes a tax under RCW 82.14.340, or within a regional transit authority if any county within the authority imposes a tax under RCW 82.14.340.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum rate of such tax that may be imposed by a regional transit authority that includes a county with a population of more than 1,500,000 must be approved by the voters and may not exceed 1.4 percent.

To be eligible to receive regional mobility grant program funds, a regional transit authority must have adopted, at a minimum, a zero-fare policy that allows passengers 18 years of age and younger to ride free of charge on all modes provided by the authority by October 1, 2022.</p>

<p>Property taxes imposed under this section may be imposed for the period of time required to pay the cost to plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain the transit facilities set forth in the approved proposition. Property taxes pledged to repay bonds may be imposed at the pledged amount until the bonds are retired. After the bonds are retired, property taxes authorized under this section must be:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Reduced to the level required to operate and maintain the regional transit authority's transit facilities; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminated, unless the taxes have been extended by public vote.</p>

<li>
<p>The legislature finds that many communities across Washington state have not equitably benefited from investments in the active transportation network. The legislature also finds that legacy state transportation facilities designed primarily for vehicle use caused disconnections in safe routes for people who walk, bike, and roll to work and to carry out other daily activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To address these investment gaps, and to honor the legacy of community advocacy of Sandy Williams, the Sandy Williams connecting communities program is established within the department. The purpose of the program is to improve active transportation connectivity in communities by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Providing safe, continuous routes for pedestrians, bicyclists, and other nonvehicle users carrying out their daily activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mitigating for the health, safety, and access impacts of transportation infrastructure that bisects communities and creates obstacles in the local active transportation network;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investing in greenways providing protected routes for a wide variety of nonvehicular users; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitating the planning, development, and implementation of projects and activities that will improve the connectivity and safety of the active transportation network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must select projects to propose to the legislature for funding. In selecting projects, the department must consider, at a minimum, the following criteria:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Access to a transit facility, community facility, commercial center, or community-identified assets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of minority and women-owned businesses and community-based organizations in planning, community engagement, design, and construction of the project;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the project will serve:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Overburdened communities as defined in RCW 70A.02.010 to mean a geographic area where vulnerable populations face combined, multiple environmental harms and health impacts, and includes, but is not limited to, highly impacted communities as defined in RCW 19.405.020;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerable populations as defined in RCW 70A.02.010 to mean population groups that are more likely to be at higher risk for poor health outcomes in response to environmental harms, due to adverse socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment, high housing, and transportation costs relative to income, limited access to nutritious food and adequate health care, linguistic isolation, and other factors that negatively affect health outcomes and increase vulnerability to the effects of environmental harms; and sensitivity factors, such as low birth weight and higher rates of hospitalization. Vulnerable populations include, but are not limited to: Racial or ethnic minorities, low-income populations, populations disproportionately impacted by environmental harms, and populations of workers experiencing environmental harms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Household incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with disabilities;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environmental health disparities, such as those indicated by the diesel pollution burden portion of the Washington environmental health disparities map developed by the department of health, or other similar indicators;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Location on or adjacent to tribal lands or locations providing essential services to tribal members;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crash experience involving pedestrians and bicyclists; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identified need by the community, for example in the state active transportation plan or a regional, county, or community plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that the Sandy Williams connecting communities program comply with the requirements of chapter 314, Laws of 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall submit a report to the transportation committees of the legislature by December 1, 2022, and each December 1st thereafter identifying the selected connecting communities projects for funding by the legislature. The report must also include the status of previously funded projects.</p>
