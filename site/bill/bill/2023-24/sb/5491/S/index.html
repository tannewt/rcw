<p>The legislative body of a county or city, in exercising the authority provided under RCW 19.27.060 to amend the code enumerated in RCW 19.27.031(1)(b), may adopt amendments that allow for up to five stories of group R-2 occupancy to be served by a single exit under the following conditions:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The building does not contain a boarding house;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The building does not contain a state licensed facility as defined in WAC 246-314-010;</p>

<p>An exterior stairway or interior exit stairway is provided. The interior exit stairway, including any related exit passageway, must be pressurized in accordance with section 909.20 of the International Building Code. Doors in the stairway must swing into the interior exit stairway regardless of the occupant load served, provided that doors from the interior exit stairway to the building exterior are permitted to swing in the direction of exit travel;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A corridor separates each dwelling unit entry/exit door from the door to an interior exit stairway, including any related exit passageway, on each floor. Dwelling unit doors must not open directly into an interior exit stairway. Dwelling unit doors are permitted to open directly into an exterior stairway;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are not more than 20 feet of travel to the exit stairway from the entry/exit door of any dwelling unit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel distance measured in accordance with section 1017 of the International Building Code does not exceed 125 feet;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exit does not terminate in an egress court where the court depth exceeds the court width unless it is possible to exit in either direction to the public way;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elevators are pressurized in accordance with section 909.21 of the International Building Code or open into elevator lobbies that comply with section 713.14 of the International Building Code. Where approved by the building official, natural ventilation is permitted to be substituted for pressurization where the ventilation would prevent the accumulation of smoke or toxic gases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Other occupancies are permitted in the same building provided they comply with all other requirements of this subsection (1). Except as provided in (m)(ii) of this subsection, other occupancies must not communicate with the group R occupancy portion of the building or with the single-exit stairway;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parking garages and occupied roofs accessory to the group R occupancy are permitted to communicate with the exit stairway;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exit serving the group R occupancy does not discharge through any other occupancy, including an accessory parking garage; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no openings within 10 feet of unprotected openings into the stairway other than required exit doors having a one-hour fire-resistance rating.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The city is served by a municipal fire department or fire district; and</p>

<li>
<p>This section expires July 1, 2026.</p>
