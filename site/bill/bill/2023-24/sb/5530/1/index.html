<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington residents would benefit from having a quick and seamless digital way to connect to public and private services. The legislature further finds that the work group created in this act will have the expertise and experience to bring together ideas for developing a &quot;Whole WA&quot; mobile application that may assist Washington residents in gaining access to a variety of existing services, such as social, behavioral health, and housing services. While many providers, both public and private, offer these types of services in Washington, the residents of our state do not always have an easy way to learn more about, and use, those services. It is the intent of the legislature that the work group created in this act will produce a plan for developing a &quot;Whole WA&quot; mobile application that will easily connect Washingtonians to the services they may need.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
