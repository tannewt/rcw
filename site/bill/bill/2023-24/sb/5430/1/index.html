<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Washington is developing a multimodal transportation system using a complete streets approach. The safety of people who drive, bike, walk, roll, and access transit on public roadways is paramount. When the legislature enacted RCW 46.20.075 in 2000, it recognized the need to develop a graduated licensing system in light of the disproportionately high incidence of motor vehicle crashes involving youthful motorists. The intent was to improve highway safety by progressively developing and improving the skills of younger drivers in the safest possible environment, thereby reducing the number of vehicle crashes. Under the safe system approach, the legislature finds that drivers who understand and follow the rules of the road are a protective factor to avoid collisions that cause property damage, bodily injury, and death, benefiting all Washington road users. Novice drivers, including those ages 16 to 25 years, account for a disproportionate number of crashes. Data compiled by the department of licensing show, however, that young drivers who are licensed during the intermediate licensing phase and complete a driver safety course before licensure have lower crash rates compared to their counterparts. Completing an accredited driver safety course and obtaining a license under intermediate licensing requirements may help mitigate the risks of crashes involving novice drivers. Most public schools no longer offer driver education programs, and the cost of driver education from private companies can pose a barrier to obtaining a driver's license for young people in low-income households and those from historically marginalized communities. Many of these communities are also disproportionately represented among victims of serious and fatal crashes. Whereas driving provides opportunities related to education, vocational training, and employment to young people, and whereas safe roads depend upon drivers who know how to use public transportation facilities as they are intended, the legislature finds there is a public interest to support driver education for low-income novice drivers.</p>
