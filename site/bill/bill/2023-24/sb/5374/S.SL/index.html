<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The growth management act has been in place for over 30 years. As time has passed, the legislature has found that the act needs to be adjusted to accommodate difficulties that have been encountered over time. The legislature finds that small cities should be able to adopt the critical areas ordinances of the counties pursuant to the advice of the work group engaged to make such positive changes to the act.</p>
