<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Naturopathic physicians, licensed under chapter 18.36A RCW since 1987 and chapter 18.36 RCW since 1919, are recognized as primary care providers in both statute and rule, and have served in this role for many years through private health plans, in apple health (medicaid), and with the Indian health service systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington has a shortage of primary care services that poses a significant risk to public health resulting in increased human suffering and increased costs. The coronavirus pandemic has added strain on an already overburdened health care system, further exposing the need to empower primary care providers to practice to the full scope of their training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some areas, naturopathic physicians are the only available health care providers. As such, they need authority for all appropriate primary care services consistent with their education and patient populations. This act supports better patient care, prevents duplication of services, reduces emergency department visits, and is more cost-effective for patients, health plans, and state agencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naturopathic medical training emphasizes behavioral health, counseling, and lifestyle medicine in addition to conventional medical diagnostics and treatments, including pharmaceutical prescriptions. Many patients seek care with naturopathic physicians in order to stop taking or lower their doses of prescription medications. Most controlled substances cannot be stopped without a careful dosage taper. Enabling naturopathic physicians to practice to the full extent of their training, to include authority to prescribe and deprescribe controlled substances, allows them to play a more significant role in addressing the ongoing opioid and benzodiazepine crises facing our communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature first granted naturopathic physicians limited prescriptive authority in 1987 and expanded this in 2005 to include all legend drugs and limited controlled substances in Schedules III through V of the uniform controlled substances act. Licensed naturopathic physicians in neighboring states currently have prescriptive authority beyond what those in Washington have. Licensed naturopathic physicians have demonstrated competence and safety in prescribing controlled substances both here and in surrounding states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This act recognizes the board of naturopathy (established by the legislature in 2011), and its role in rule making for determination of specific clinical parameters and educational requirements in the same manner as other boards and commissions with primary care authority.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subject to the requirements of this section, a naturopathic physician may prescribe and administer legend drugs and controlled substances contained in Schedules II through V of the uniform controlled substances act, chapter 69.50 RCW, as necessary in the practice of naturopathy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A naturopathic physician who prescribes controlled substances shall register with the department to access the prescription monitoring program established in chapter 70.225 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By rule, the board shall establish education and training requirements related to prescribing legend drugs and controlled substances. A naturopathic physician may prescribe and administer drugs pursuant to subsection (1) of this section only if he or she satisfies the education and training requirements established by the board.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>A naturopathic physician may sign and attest to any certificates, cards, forms, or other required documentation that a physician may sign, so long as it is within the naturopathic physician's scope of practice. This includes, but is not limited to, disability determinations, physician orders for life-sustaining treatment, hospice orders, student athletic forms, guardianships, powers of attorney, and similar legal documents.</p>
