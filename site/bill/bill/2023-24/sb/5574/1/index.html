<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Beginning July 1, 2027, before accepting an application for an initial annual vehicle registration or renewal, the department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director must require the applicant to pay a per mile fee as specified in this section. This fee is in addition to all other fees and taxes required by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rate of the per mile fee will be established in subsequent legislation and will be based on the annual miles driven as manually reported by the applicant pursuant to (c) of this subsection.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Any miles driven on private property, on farmlands, outside the state of Washington, or as any other nonpublic highway travel, must be excluded from the per mile fee by affidavit signed by the applicant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miles driven on farmland may be excluded from the per mile fee only if the applicant maintains a log of the applicant's annual miles driven on farmland. Each log of annual miles driven on farmland must be maintained by the applicant for a minimum of three years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of vehicle registration or renewal, the applicant must manually report the annual miles driven by submitting a copy of the vehicle's odometer. The difference in mileage between the mileage being currently reported on the application, and the mileage reported the previous year, constitutes the annual miles driven for purposes of paying the fee under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of making this calculation, the department shall adopt rules for determining the mileage reported for the previous year for vehicles being registered in the state for the first time because of a new vehicle purchase, a transfer of ownership, or being registered in Washington for the first time after being registered in another state. Prior to allowing a transfer of ownership, the department shall verify that all per mile fee obligations have been paid by the vehicle owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The per mile funding system must be implemented by allowing the applicant to establish an account for the prepayment or monthly payment of the applicant's per mile fee obligation. The account may be reviewed by the following in order to determine if the applicant currently owes fees under this section:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The department, county auditor or other agent, or subagent appointed by the director; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle dealers under chapter 46.70 RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proceeds from the per mile fee imposed under this section must be used for preservation and maintenance and must be deposited in the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In administering the per mile fee system, the department shall only expend funds specifically appropriated for this purpose. These amounts must be separately identified in each transportation omnibus appropriations act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The per mile system established to collect the per mile fee under section 1 of this act may not involve the collection of any personally identifying information beyond what is necessary to properly calculate, report, and collect the per mile fee, unless the vehicle owner provides his or her express written consent for the collection of additional information.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Per mile reporting methods shall not report specific location data to the department or any subdivision of the state, including travel patterns, origins, destinations, waypoint locations, or times of travel unless a vehicle owner specifically consents to the recording or reporting of such location data.</p>
