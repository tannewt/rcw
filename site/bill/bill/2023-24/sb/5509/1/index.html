<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that there exists in the state of Washington billions of dollars of critical local projects for the planning, acquisition, construction, repair, replacement, rehabilitation, or improvement of streets and roads, bridges, water systems, storm and sanitary sewage systems, solid waste handling, communications systems, housing, and other public infrastructure and economic development projects. But while some local governments successfully borrow for infrastructure and economic development capital projects through private sector lenders and the bond markets, other government entities do not have the same access to capital at attractive rates to be used in building out public infrastructure.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage self-reliance by local and tribal governments in meeting their public works and economic development needs, and to assist in the financing of critical public works and economic development projects by providing effective mechanisms for making and financing loans and providing financing guarantees that do not create state debt. It is also the policy of the state to provide technical assistance to government entities for these projects.</p>
<p>It is further the policy of the state to foster and promote by all reasonable means the provision of adequate capital markets and facilities for borrowing money by local governments in the state to finance infrastructure improvements, and to the greatest extent possible to reduce costs of borrowed money to taxpayers and residents of the state.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that a Washington state public infrastructure bank would provide opportunities for local and tribal government entities to competitively finance a broad array of public infrastructure and economic development projects, including housing, at competitive rates with low administrative costs. A state public infrastructure bank will complement the existing banking system by filling gaps that the system cannot or will not fill, and it will be uniquely positioned to provide specialized technical assistance to the diverse needs of local and tribal government entities.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a Washington state public infrastructure bank to act as a financial conduit that, without creating state debt, can receive funds from federal, state, local, and tribal government entities, issue and make loans to those entities, and issue bonds in a manner that does not create state debt, to help facilitate access to needed capital by local and tribal government entities on reasonable terms and rates.</p>
<p>The state public infrastructure bank will have full powers to borrow money and to issue its bonds and notes in a manner that does not create state debt in order to make capital funds available for borrowing by local and tribal government entities, and those powers will enable the state public infrastructure bank to carry out the declared policies of this act, which are in the public interest of the state and its taxpayers and residents.</p>
