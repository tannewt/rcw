<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many cities in Washington are actively planning for growth under the growth management act, chapter 36.70A RCW;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The construction industry provides living wage jobs for families across Washington;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the current economic climate, the creation of additional affordable housing units is essential to the economic health of our cities and our state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is critical that Washington state promote its cities and its property owners that will provide affordable housing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A meaningful, fair, and predictable economic incentive should be created to stimulate the redevelopment of underdeveloped property in targeted urban areas through a limited sales and use tax deferral program as provided by this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This limited tax deferral will help the owners of underdeveloped property and housing equity property achieve the highest and best use of land and enable cities to more fully realize their planning goals and will help ensure limited resources are narrowly focused on affordable housing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data regarding the number of additional affordable units created due to the limited tax deferral will be evaluated to determine if this tool could be used to increase affordable housing in other areas of the state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to encourage the redevelopment of underdeveloped land in targeted urban areas, thereby increasing affordable housing, employment opportunities, and helping accomplish the other planning goals of Washington cities. Additionally, it is the purpose of this chapter to support investments by regional affordable housing collaborators by maximizing the use of these funds directly for affordable housing. The legislative authorities of cities to which this chapter applies may authorize a sales and use tax deferral for an investment project within the city if the legislative authority of the city finds that it has housing equity property or there are significant areas of underdeveloped land and a lack of affordable housing in areas proximate to the land. If a conditional recipient maintains the property for qualifying purposes for at least 10 years, deferred sales and use taxes need not be repaid.</p>

<p>This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in chapter . . ., Laws of 2023 (this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to expand affordable housing options for very low to moderate-income households, specifically in underdeveloped urban areas and urban areas where a substantial influx of employees related to a small number of very large employers have contributed to a lack of affordable housing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To measure the effectiveness of the tax preference in this act, the joint legislative audit and review committee must evaluate the number of increased housing units on housing equity property. If a review finds that the number of affordable housing units has not increased, then the legislature intends to repeal this tax preference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The review must be provided to the fiscal committees of the legislature by December 31, 2030.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any available data source, including data collected by the department under RCW 82.92.080.</p>
