<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that the words &quot;We the People&quot; are central to our system of government. Universal civic duty voting would give us a system where every vote counts, and the people who represent us would have to speak to all of us. People would be able to vote without obstruction or suppression. Washington voters who now solemnly accept their responsibilities to sit on juries, defend our country, and pay taxes should take the obligation to the work of government just as seriously. People must register for the selective service, serve on a jury, and pay taxes; they should also be required to cast a ballot. With this act the legislature creates an election system designed to enable citizens to perform their most basic civic duty with ease. Civic duty voting declares that everyone counts and that everyone has a responsibility to have their vote counted.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every person who is eligible to vote under Article VI, section 1 of the state Constitution must register to vote using one of the methods prescribed in this title unless the person obtains a waiver from the obligation to register to vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A waiver from the obligation to register to vote is permanent unless withdrawn by the person who has obtained the waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person is not required to provide a reason for seeking the waiver from the obligation to register to vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person may withdraw their waiver from the obligation to register to vote at any time by registering to vote under any of the methods prescribed in this chapter. If a person withdraws their waiver and registers to vote, the person shall become eligible to vote according to the timelines in RCW 29A.08.140.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary shall create a form to allow persons to waive the obligation to register to vote. The form shall be clear, concise, and minimize the risk that the applicant for the waiver of the obligation to register will make any errors. The form must be made available online on the secretary's website and the website of county elections officials. The form must also be transmitted to state agencies conducting voter registration as designated under RCW 29A.08.310.</p>

<li>
<p>The secretary of state shall prescribe the method of voter registration for each designated agency.

</li>
<li>
<p>The person providing service at the agency shall offer voter registration services to every client whenever he or she applies for service or assistance and with each renewal, recertification, or change of address.

</li>
<li>
<p>The person providing service at the agency shall determine if the prospective applicant wants to register to vote or update his or her voter registration by asking the following question:</p>

If the applicant answers in the negative to either question, the agent shall  provide the applicant with a form for the waiver from the obligation to register to vote.</p>
<ol start="4">

<p>If an agency uses a computerized application process, it may, in consultation with the secretary of state, develop methods to capture simultaneously the information required for voter registration during a person's computerized application process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each designated agency shall transmit the applications and waivers to the secretary of state or appropriate county auditor within three business days and must be received by the election official by the required voter registration deadline.</p>
