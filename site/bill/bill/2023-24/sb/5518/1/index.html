<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that Washington state branches of government, agencies, boards, and commissions manage and protect highly sensitive data to best serve constituents. The data managed by public entities is a high value target for domestic and international perpetrators of for-profit ransomware and other malicious cyber activities. Breaches in data security prevent state agencies from protecting confidential and sensitive information stored in technology systems.</p>
<p>In the absence of immutable data protection capabilities and reliable disaster recovery practices, the legislature finds that a breach of state agency information technology systems may result in the reduction of critical constituent services and increased risk of financial harm related to identity theft.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that state agencies have implemented enterprise technology programs, standards, and policies for data backup and recovery practices to protect confidential and sensitive information contained in enterprise and individual state agencies' information technology systems. The legislature further finds that combining these data protection practices with preventative practices, such as an enterprise identity management solution, the active promotion of cybersecurity awareness practices, and maintaining the readiness of state resources for incident management is the best protection that the state can offer to combat the effects of ransomware and other malicious cyber activities.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that action must be taken at each state agency to ensure data protection and disaster recovery practices are consistent with enterprise technology standards and is aware that additional investments in technology, training, and personnel will be needed. The legislature further recognizes that adequate funding must be provided to support agency efforts to protect confidential and sensitive data stored in technology systems.</p>
