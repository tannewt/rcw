<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter may be known and cited as the childhood protection act.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Section 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that important information relating to a child should not be withheld, either inadvertently or purposefully, from his or her parent, including information relating to the child's health, well-being, and education, while the child is in the custody of the school district. The legislature further finds it is necessary to establish a consistent mechanism for parents to be notified of information relating to the health and well-being of their children and that it is a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children, and for children to be protected by their parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this chapter, the term &quot;parent&quot; means a person who has legal custody of a minor child as a natural or adoptive parent or a legal guardian.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section-3">Section 3 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3">¶</a></h2>
<p>The state, any of its political subdivisions, any other governmental entity, or any other institution may not infringe on the fundamental right of a minor child to have his or her parent direct the child's upbringing, education, health care, and mental health without demonstrating that such action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and that such action is narrowly tailored and is not otherwise served by a less restrictive means.</p>

<h2 id="section-7">Section 7 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7">¶</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>School districts must adopt a policy and procedure for notifying a student's parent if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being and the school's ability to provide a safe and supportive learning environment for the student. The policy and procedure must reinforce the fundamental right of a minor child to have his or her parents make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children by requiring school district staff to encourage a student to discuss issues relating to his or her well-being with his or her parent or to facilitate discussion of the issue with the parent. The policy and procedure may not prohibit parents from accessing any of their student's education records created, maintained, or used by the school district, as required by RCW 28A.605.030 and any of their student's health records created, maintained, or used by the school district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A school district may not adopt a policy or procedure that prohibits school district staff from notifying a parent about his or her student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being, or a change in related services or monitoring, or that encourage or have the effect of encouraging a student to withhold from a parent such information. School district staff may not discourage or prohibit parental notification of and involvement in critical decisions affecting a student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being. This subsection does not prohibit a school district from adopting a policy or procedure that permits school district staff to withhold such information from a parent if a reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect, as those terms are defined in RCW 13.34.030 and 26.44.020.</p>

<p>Classroom instruction by school district staff or third parties on sexual orientation including gender expression or identity may not occur in kindergarten through third grade or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state learning standards.</p>

<li>
<p>At the beginning of the school year, each school district must notify parents of each health care service offered at their student's school and the option to withhold consent or decline any specific service unless parental consent is not required by law. Parental consent to a health care service does not waive the right of a minor child to have his or her parent access his or her child's educational or health records or to be notified about a change in his or her child's services or monitoring as provided by this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before administering a questionnaire, screening form, or diagnostic assessment related to student well-being or health to a student in kindergarten through third grade, the school district must provide the questionnaire, screening form, or diagnostic assessment to the parent and obtain the permission of the parent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each school district shall adopt a policy and procedure for a parent to notify the principal, or his or her designee, regarding concerns under this section at his or her student's school and the process for resolving those concerns within seven calendar days after notification by the parent.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>At a minimum, the policy and procedure must require that within 30 days after notification by the parent that the concern remains unresolved, the school district must either resolve the concern or provide a statement of the reasons for not resolving the concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a concern is not resolved by the school district, a parent may:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Request the superintendent of public instruction to appoint a special magistrate who is a member of the Washington state bar association in good standing and who has at least five years' experience in administrative law. The special magistrate must determine facts relating to the dispute over the school district policy, procedure, or practice, consider information provided by the school district, and render a recommended decision for resolution to the state board of education within 30 days after receipt of the request by the parent. The state board of education must approve or reject the recommended decision at its next regularly scheduled meeting that is more than seven calendar days and no more than 30 days after the date the recommended decision is transmitted. The costs of the special magistrate must be borne by the school district. The state board of education must adopt rules, including forms, necessary to implement this subsection; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring an action against the school district to obtain a declaratory judgment that the school district policy, procedure, or practice violates this section and seek injunctive relief. A court may award damages and must award reasonable attorney fees and court costs to a parent who receives declaratory or injunctive relief.</p>
