<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The department of licensing shall develop a comprehensive implementation plan for the expansion of the current driver training education requirement to obtain a driver's license to persons between the ages of 18 and 24. The target date for implementation of the new driver training education expansion is July 1, 2026. The driver training education expansion plan must be provided to the transportation committees of the legislature by October 1, 2024, and must include, but need not be limited to, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consideration of courses that could satisfy the new driver training education requirement, including a condensed course option and a self-paced, online course option, with attention to the educational value, monetary and time costs required, and possible accessibility constraints for each course option considered;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of public and private resources necessary to support the new driver training education requirement to ensure sufficient course availability and accessibility. The assessment must include, but need not be limited to, an inventory of the current number, and an estimate of the increased number required to meet the anticipated need, of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Licensed driver training schools and traffic safety education programs in the state, by geographical region;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licensed driver training school and traffic safety education instructors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licensed driver trainer instructors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Driver training education course spaces available per year, by course option and for both classroom and behind-the-wheel instruction;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In consultation with the office of equity, evaluation of access to driver training education courses and consideration of opportunities to improve access to driver training education for young drivers. The assessment must address, but should not be limited to, potential obstacles for young drivers for whom the cost of driver training education may pose a hardship, obstacles related to accessibility for young drivers who reside in rural areas, and obstacles for young drivers whose primary language is not English. The assessment must also include strategies that can be used to mitigate these potential obstacles, including possible exceptions to, or substitutions for, a driver training education requirement in cases where access-related obstacles cannot be overcome, such as when a behind-the-wheel driver training program may not be available within a reasonable distance of a person's residence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A plan for broad and accessible public outreach and education to communicate to Washington state residents new driver training education requirements, including a plan for the development of tools to assist residents in accessing driver training education courses that meet the new requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration with educational service districts to determine the extent to which educational service districts can facilitate the coordination between school districts or secondary schools of a school district and driver training schools to increase access to driver training education courses by students who reside within the boundaries of an applicable school district;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An examination of opportunities to address the financial need of persons for whom the cost of driver training education courses licensed by the department of licensing may pose a hardship, through a voucher or other financial assistance program. The examination must include quantified estimates of the extent to which the cost of driver training education could pose a significant obstacle, as well as possible approaches to help reduce or eliminate this obstacle;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An examination, in consultation with the office of the superintendent of public instruction, of opportunities to address the financial need of students for whom the cost of driver training education offered as part of a traffic safety education program may pose a hardship, through a grant or other financial assistance program. The examination must include quantified estimates of the extent to which the cost of driver training education could pose a significant obstacle, as well as possible approaches to help reduce or eliminate this obstacle; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of approaches used by other states that require driver training by persons age 18 and older, including examination of how this has impacted traffic safety in the state and the extent to which the requirement may have decreased access to driver's licenses, including through examination of the rate of driver's license holders by age and other demographic characteristics compared to that of neighboring, or otherwise similarly situated, states.</p>
