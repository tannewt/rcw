<p>This chapter applies to a transfer that refers to this chapter in the designation under RCW 11.114.090(1) by which the transfer is made if at the time of the transfer, the transferor, the minor, or the custodian is a resident of this state or the custodial property is located in this state. The custodianship so created remains subject to this chapter despite a subsequent change in residence of a transferor, the minor, or the custodian, or the removal of custodial property from this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person designated as custodian under this chapter is subject to personal jurisdiction in this state with respect to any matter relating to the custodianship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer that purports to be made and which is valid under the uniform transfers to minors act, the uniform gifts to minors act, or a substantially similar act of another state is governed by the law of the designated state and may be executed and is enforceable in this state if at the time of the transfer, the transferor, the minor, or the custodian is a resident of the designated state or the custodial property is located in the designated state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A matter**, whether at law or in equity, involving an account established** under this chapter <strong>shall be addressed, resolved, and settled under the procedures provided under chapter 11.96A RCW</strong>.</p>

<li>A person having the right to designate the recipient of property transferable upon the occurrence of a future event may revocably nominate a custodian to receive the property for a minor beneficiary upon the occurrence of the event by naming the custodian followed in substance by the words: &quot;. . . . . . as custodian for . . . . . . (name of minor) under the Washington uniform transfers to minors act.&quot; The nomination may name one or more persons as substitute custodians to whom the property shall be transferred, in the order named, if the first nominated custodian dies before the transfer or is unable, declines, or is ineligible to serve. The nomination may be made in a will, a trust, a deed, an instrument exercising a power of appointment, or in a writing designating a beneficiary of contractual rights which is registered with or delivered to the payor, issuer, or other obligor of the contractual rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an alternative to naming a specific person as custodian, the nomination may provide that the custodian may be designated by the legal representative of, or other person specified by, the person having the right to designate the recipient of the property described in this subsection. The person having the right of designation of the custodian is authorized to designate himself or herself as custodian, if he or she falls within the class of persons eligible to serve as custodian under RCW 11.114.090(1).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>A custodian nominated under this section shall be a person to whom a transfer of property of that kind may be made under RCW 11.114.090(1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of designating one specific minor, the designation may specify multiple persons or a class or classes of persons, but when the custodial property is actually created under subsection (4) of this section, it must be constituted as a separate custodianship for each beneficiary, and each beneficiary's interest in it must be determined in accordance with the governing instrument and applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nomination of a custodian under this section does not create custodial property until the nominating instrument becomes irrevocable or a transfer to the nominated custodian is completed under RCW 11.114.090. Unless the nomination of a custodian has been revoked, upon the occurrence of the future event the custodianship becomes effective and the custodian shall enforce a transfer of the custodial property pursuant to RCW 11.114.090.</p>

<li>
<p>Take control of custodial property;</p>

<li>
<p>Register or record title to custodial property if appropriate; and</p>

<p>In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care applicable to fiduciaries under chapter 11.100 RCW. If a custodian has a special skill or expertise or is named custodian on the basis of representations of a special skill or expertise, the custodian shall use that skill or expertise. A custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor's estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor according to the same standards as apply to a fiduciary holding trust funds under RCW 11.100.060.

<p>A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on (a) the life of the minor only if the minor or the minor's estate is the sole beneficiary, or (b) the life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest only to the extent that the minor, the minor's estate, or the custodian in the capacity of custodian, is the irrevocable beneficiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the minor. Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is so identified if the minor's interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed. Custodial property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration is so identified if it is either registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words: &quot;. . . . . . as custodian for . . . . . . (name of minor) under the Washington uniform transfers to minors act.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
