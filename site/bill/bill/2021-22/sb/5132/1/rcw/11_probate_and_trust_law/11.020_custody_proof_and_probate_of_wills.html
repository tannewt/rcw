<li>
<p>Applications for the probate of a will and for letters testamentary, or either, may be made to the judge of the court having jurisdiction and the court may immediately hear the proofs and either probate or reject such will as the testimony may justify. Upon such hearing the court shall make and cause to be entered a formal order, either establishing and probating such will, or refusing to establish and probate the same, and such order shall be conclusive except in the event of a contest of such will as hereinafter provided. All testimony in support of the will shall be reduced to writing, signed by the witnesses, and certified by the judge of the court. If the application for probate of a will does not request the appointment of a personal representative and the court enters an adjudication of testacy establishing such will no further administration shall be required except as commenced pursuant to RCW 11.28.330 or 11.28.340.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the foregoing procedure for the proof of wills, any or all of the attesting witnesses to a will may, at the request of the testator or, after his or her decease, at the request of the executor or any person interested under it, make an affidavit before any person authorized to administer oaths, stating such facts as they would be required to testify to in court to prove such will, which affidavit may be written on the will or may be <strong>affixed or logically associated with</strong> the will or  a photographic copy of the will <strong>or an electronic will</strong>. The sworn statement of any witness so taken shall be accepted by the court as if it had been taken before the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An electronic will, the custody of which has not been maintained by a qualified custodian, must be treated as a lost or destroyed will under RCW 11.20.070.</strong></p>

<p>The subsequent incompetency from whatever cause of one or more of the subscribing witnesses, or their inability to testify in open court or pursuant to commission, or their absence from the state, shall not prevent the probate of the will.

<p>If a will has been lost or destroyed under circumstances such that the loss or destruction does not have the effect of revoking the will, <strong>or is an electronic will, custody of which has not been maintained by a qualified custodian,</strong> the court may take proof of the execution and validity of the will and establish it, notice to all persons interested having been first given.
