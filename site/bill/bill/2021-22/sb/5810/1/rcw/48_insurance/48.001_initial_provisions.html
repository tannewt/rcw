<p>An issuer and an employee welfare benefit plan, whether insured or self funded, as defined in the employee retirement income security act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1101 et seq. may not deny enrollment of a child under the health plan of the child's parent on the grounds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The child was born out of wedlock;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child is not claimed as a dependent on the parent's federal tax return; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child does not reside with the parent or in the issuer's, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan's service area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a child has health coverage through an issuer, or an insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan of a noncustodial parent, the issuer, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan, shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Provide such information to the custodial parent as may be necessary for the child to obtain benefits through that coverage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permit the provider or the custodial parent to submit claims for covered services without the approval of the noncustodial parent. If the provider submits the claim, the provider will obtain the custodial parent's assignment of insurance benefits or otherwise secure the custodial parent's approval.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For purposes of this subsection the health care authority as the state medicaid agency under RCW 74.09.500 may reassign medical insurance rights to the provider for custodial parents whose children are eligible for services under RCW 74.09.500; and</p>
<ol type="a" start="3">
<li>Make payments on claims submitted in accordance with (b) of this subsection directly to the custodial parent, to the provider, or to the health care authority as the state medicaid agency under RCW 74.09.500.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Where a child does not reside in the issuer's service area, an issuer shall cover no less than urgent and emergent care. Where the issuer offers broader coverage, whether by policy or reciprocal agreement, the issuer shall provide such coverage to any child otherwise covered that does not reside in the issuer's service area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a parent is required by a court order to provide health coverage for a child, and the parent is eligible for family health coverage, the issuer, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan, shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Permit the parent to enroll, under the family coverage, a child who is otherwise eligible for the coverage without regard to any enrollment season restrictions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enroll the child under family coverage upon application of the child's other parent, health care authority as the state medicaid agency under RCW 74.09.500, or child support enforcement program, if the parent is enrolled but fails to make application to obtain coverage for such child; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not disenroll, or eliminate coverage of, such child who is otherwise eligible for the coverage unless the issuer or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan is provided satisfactory written evidence that:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The court order is no longer in effect; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child is or will be enrolled in comparable health coverage through another issuer, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan, which will take effect not later than the effective date of disenrollment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>An issuer, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan, that has been assigned the rights of an individual eligible for medical assistance under medicaid and coverage for health benefits from the issuer, or insured or self funded employee welfare benefit plan, may not impose requirements on the health care authority that are different from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of any other individual so covered.</p>
