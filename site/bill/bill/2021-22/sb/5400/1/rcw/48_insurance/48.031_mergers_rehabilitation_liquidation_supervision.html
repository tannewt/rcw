<li>
<p>Documents, materials, or other information that the commissioner obtains under this chapter in the commissioner's capacity as a receiver as defined in RCW 48.99.010(12), are records under the jurisdiction and control of the receivership court. These records are confidential by law and privileged, are not subject to chapter 42.56 or 40.14 RCW, and are not subject to subpoena directed to the commissioner or any person who received documents, materials, or other information while acting under the authority of the commissioner. The commissioner is authorized to use such documents, materials, or other information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as a part of the commissioner's official duties. The confidentiality and privilege created by this section and RCW 42.56.400(17) is not waived if confidential and privileged information under this section is shared with any person acting under the authority of the commissioner, representatives of insurance guaranty associations that may have statutory obligations as a result of the insolvency of an insurer, the national association of insurance commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries, regulatory and law enforcement officials of other states and nations, the federal government, and international authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither the commissioner nor any person who received documents, materials, or other information while acting under the authority of the commissioner as receiver is required to testify in any private civil action concerning any confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information subject to subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person who can demonstrate a legal interest in the receivership estate or a reasonable suspicion of negligence or malfeasance by the commissioner related to an insurer receivership may file a motion in the receivership matter to allow inspection of private company information or documents otherwise not subject to disclosure under subsection (1) of this section. The court shall conduct an in-camera review after notifying the commissioner and every party that produced the information. The court may order the commissioner to allow the petitioner to have access to the information provided the petitioner maintains the confidentiality of the information. The petitioner must not disclose the information to any other person, except upon further order of the court. After conducting a hearing, the court may order that the information can be disclosed publicly if the court finds that there is a public interest in the disclosure of the information and protection of the information from public disclosure is clearly unnecessary to protect any individual's right of privacy, or any company's proprietary information, and the commissioner has not demonstrated that disclosure would impair any vital governmental function, or the receiver's ability to manage the estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The confidentiality and privilege of documents, materials, or other information obtained by the receiver set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section does not apply to litigation to which the insurer in receivership is a party.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Is insolvent; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has refused to submit its books, records, accounts, or affairs to the reasonable examination of the commissioner; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has failed to comply with the commissioner's order, made pursuant to law, to make good an impairment of capital (if a stock insurer) or an impairment of assets (if a mutual or reciprocal insurer) within the time prescribed by law; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has transferred or attempted to transfer substantially its entire property or business, or has entered into any transaction the effect of which is to merge substantially its entire property or business in that of any other insurer without first having obtained the written approval of the commissioner; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is found, after examination, to be in such condition that its further transaction of business will be hazardous to its policyholders, or to its creditors, or to its members, subscribers, or stockholders, or to the public; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has willfully violated its charter or any law of this state; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has an officer, director, or manager who has refused to be examined under oath, concerning its affairs, for which purpose the commissioner is authorized to conduct and to enforce by all appropriate and available means any such examination under oath in any other state or territory of the United States, in which any such officer, director, or manager may then presently be, to the full extent permitted by the laws of any such other state or territory, this special authorization considered; or</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>There is reasonable cause to believe that there has been embezzlement from the insurer, wrongful sequestration or diversion of the insurer's assets, forgery or fraud affecting the insurer, or other illegal conduct in, by, or with respect to the insurer that, if established, would endanger assets in an amount threatening the solvency of the insurer; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insurer has failed to remove a person who in fact has executive authority in the insurer, whether an officer, manager, general agent, employee, or other person, if the person has been found after notice and hearing by the commissioner to be dishonest or untrustworthy in a way affecting the insurer's business; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control of the insurer, whether by stock ownership or ownership or otherwise, and whether direct or indirect, is in a person or persons found after notice and hearing to be untrustworthy; or</p>

<p>The commissioner, or any interested person upon due notice to the commissioner, at any time may apply for an order terminating the rehabilitation proceeding and permitting the insurer to resume possession of its property and the conduct of its business, but no such order shall be granted except when, after a full hearing, the court has determined that the purposes of the proceedings have been fully accomplished.</p>

<li>
<p>An order to rehabilitate the business of a domestic insurer, or an alien insurer domiciled in this state, shall appoint the commissioner and his or her successors in office as the rehabilitator, and shall direct the rehabilitator to immediately take possession of the assets of the insurer, and to administer them under the general supervision of the court. The filing or recording of the order with the recorder of deeds of the county in this state in which the principal business of the company is conducted, or the county in this state in which the company's principal office or place of business is located, imparts the same notice as a deed or other evidence of title duly filed or recorded with that recorder of deeds would have imparted. The order to rehabilitate the insurer by operation of law vests title to all assets of the insurer in the rehabilitator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An order issued under this section requires accountings to the court by the rehabilitator. Accountings must be done at such intervals as the court specifies in its order, but no less frequently than semiannually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entry of an order of rehabilitation does not constitute an anticipatory breach of contracts of the insurer nor may it be grounds for retroactive revocation or retroactive cancellation of contracts of the insurer, unless the revocation or cancellation is done by the rehabilitator.</p>

The rehabilitator shall take such action respecting the pending litigation as he or she deems necessary in the interests of justice and for the protection of creditors, policyholders, and the public.

<p>The priority of distribution of claims from the insurer's estate is as follows: Every claim in a class must be paid in full or adequate funds retained for payment before the members of the next class receive any payment; no subclasses may be established within a class; and no claim by a shareholder, policyholder, or other creditor may circumvent the priority classes through the use of equitable remedies. The order of distribution of claims is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Class 1. The costs and expenses of administration during rehabilitation and liquidation, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The actual and necessary costs of preserving or recovering the assets of the insurer;</p>

<p>Class 2. Loss claims. For purposes of this section, loss claims are all claims under policies, including claims of the federal or a state or local government, for losses incurred, including third-party claims, and all claims of a guaranty association or foreign guaranty association. All claims under life insurance and annuity policies, whether for death proceeds, annuity proceeds, or investment values, are loss claims. That portion of any loss indemnification that is provided for by other benefits or advantages recovered by the claimant, is not included in this class, other than benefits or advantages recovered or recoverable in discharge of familial obligations of support or by way of succession at death or as proceeds of life insurance, or as gratuities. No payment by an employer to an employee may be treated as a gratuity. Loss claims also include claims under nonassessable policies for unearned premium or other premium refunds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class 3. Claims of the federal government, other than claims which are included as loss claims under subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class 4. Reasonable compensation to employees for services performed to the extent that they do not exceed two months of monetary compensation and represent payment for services performed within one year before the filing of the petition for liquidation or, if rehabilitation preceded liquidation, within one year before the filing of the petition for rehabilitation; except, where there are no claims and no potential claims of the federal government in the estate, in which case claims in this class shall have priority over claims in class 2 and below. Principal officers and directors are not entitled to the benefit of this priority except as otherwise approved by the liquidator and the court. This priority is in lieu of any other similar priority that may be authorized by law as to wages or compensation of employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class 5. Claims of general creditors including claims of ceding and assuming companies in their capacity as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class 6. Claims of any state or local government, except those under subsection (2) of this section. Claims, including those of any governmental body for a penalty or forfeiture, are allowed in this class only to the extent of the pecuniary loss sustained from the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose, with reasonable and actual costs occasioned thereby. The remainder of such claims are postponed to the class of claims under subsection (9) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class 7. Claims filed late or any other claims other than claims under subsections (8) and (9) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class 8. Surplus or contribution notes, or similar obligations, and premium refunds on assessable policies. Payments to members of domestic mutual insurance companies are limited in accordance with law.</p>
