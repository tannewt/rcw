<li>
<p>In order to enforce collection of the tax hereby levied, the department of revenue must design and have printed stamps of such size and denominations as may be determined by the department. The stamps must be affixed on the smallest container or package that will be handled, sold, used, consumed, or distributed, to permit the department to readily ascertain by inspection, whether or not such tax has been paid or whether an exemption from the tax applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, only a wholesaler may cause to be affixed on every package of cigarettes, stamps of an amount equaling the tax due thereon or stamps identifying the cigarettes as exempt before he or she sells, offers for sale, uses, consumes, handles, removes, or otherwise disturbs and distributes the same. However, where it is established to the satisfaction of the department that it is impractical to affix such stamps to the smallest container or package, the department may authorize the affixing of stamps of appropriate denomination to a large container or package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, only wholesalers may purchase or obtain cigarette stamps. Wholesalers may not sell or provide stamps to any other wholesaler or person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each roll of stamps, or group of sheets, must have a separate serial number, which is legible at the point of sale. The department of revenue must keep records of which wholesaler purchases each roll or group of sheets. If the department of revenue permits wholesalers to purchase partial rolls or sheets, in no case may stamps bearing the same serial number be sold to more than one wholesaler. The remainder of the roll or sheet, if any, must either be retained for later purchases by the same wholesaler or destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting any otherwise lawful activity under a cigarette tax compact pursuant to chapter 43.06 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to enforce collection of the tax in the case of roll-your-own cigarettes, a retailer must affix a stamp or stamps to each box or similar container provided by the retailer to the consumer. The box or similar container must be used by a consumer to transport roll-your-own cigarettes from the retailer's place of business. A retailer must provide cigarette tubes to a consumer in one or more twenty unit denominations. Stamps must be for an amount equaling the tax due under this chapter. Each cigarette tube or paper provided to the consumer is deemed a cigarette for purposes of imposing and collecting taxes under this chapter. Stamps for roll-your-own cigarettes must be issued and affixed in a manner determined by the department but as consistent as practicable with the stamping requirements for wholesalers.</p>

<li>
<p>It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to levy a tax on all of the articles taxed under this chapter, sold, used, consumed, handled, possessed, or distributed within this state and to collect the tax from the person who first sells, uses, consumes, handles, possesses (either physically or constructively, in accordance with RCW 82.24.020) or distributes them in the state. It is further the intent and purpose of this chapter that whenever any of the articles taxed under this chapter is given away for advertising or any other purpose, it shall be taxed in the same manner as if it were sold, used, consumed, handled, possessed, or distributed in this state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the intent and purpose of this chapter that the tax shall be imposed at the time and place of the first taxable event and upon the first taxable person within this state. Any person whose activities would otherwise require payment of the tax imposed by subsection (1) of this section but who is exempt from the tax nevertheless has a precollection obligation for the tax that must be imposed on the first taxable event within this state. A precollection obligation may not be imposed upon a person exempt from the tax who sells, distributes, or transfers possession of cigarettes to another person who, by law, is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter or upon whom the obligation for collection of the tax may not be imposed. Failure to pay the tax with respect to a taxable event shall not prevent tax liability from arising by reason of a subsequent taxable event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event of an increase in the rate of the tax imposed under this chapter, it is the intent of the legislature that the first person who sells, uses, consumes, handles, possesses, or distributes previously taxed articles after the effective date of the rate increase shall be liable for the additional tax, or its precollection obligation as required by this chapter, represented by the rate increase. The failure to pay the additional tax with respect to the first taxable event after the effective date of a rate increase shall not prevent tax liability for the additional tax from arising from a subsequent taxable event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature that, in the absence of a cigarette tax contract or agreement under chapter 43.06 RCW, applicable taxes imposed by this chapter be collected on cigarettes sold by an Indian tribal organization to any person who is not an enrolled member of the federally recognized Indian tribe within whose jurisdiction the sale takes place consistent with collection of these taxes generally within the state. The legislature finds that applicable collection and enforcement measures under this chapter are reasonably necessary to prevent fraudulent transactions and place a minimal burden on the Indian tribal organization, pursuant to the United States supreme court's decision in Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134 (1980).</p>

<p>The licenses issuable under this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A wholesaler's license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A retailer's license.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application for the licenses must be made through the business licensing system under chapter 19.02 RCW. The board must adopt rules regarding the regulation of the licenses. The board may refrain from the issuance of any license under this chapter if the board has reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has willfully withheld information requested for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the applicant to receive a license, or if the board has reasonable cause to believe that information submitted in the application is false or misleading or is not made in good faith. In addition, for the purpose of reviewing an application for a wholesaler's license or retailer's license and for considering the denial, suspension, or revocation of any such license, the board may consider any prior criminal conduct of the applicant, including an administrative violation history record with the board and a criminal history record information check within the previous five years, in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions, and the provisions of RCW 9.95.240 and chapter 9.96A RCW do not apply to such cases. The board may, in its discretion, grant or refuse the wholesaler's license or retailer's license, subject to the provisions of RCW 82.24.550.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may qualify for a wholesaler's license or a retailer's license under this section without first undergoing a criminal background check. The background check must be performed by the board and must disclose any criminal conduct within the previous five years in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions. A person who possesses a valid license on July 22, 2001, is subject to this subsection and subsection (2) of this section beginning on the date of the person's business license expiration under chapter 19.02 RCW, and thereafter. If the applicant or licensee also has a license issued under chapter 66.24, 82.26, or 70.345 RCW, the background check done under the authority of chapter 66.24, 82.26, or 70.345 RCW satisfies the requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each such license expires on the business license expiration date, and each such license must be continued annually if the licensee has paid the required fee**, plus any temporary license fee surcharge that may apply under section 13 of this act for retailers,** and complied with all the provisions of this chapter and the rules of the board made pursuant thereto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each license and any other evidence of the license that the board requires must be exhibited in each place of business for which it is issued and in the manner required for the display of a business license.</p>

<p>A fee of six hundred fifty dollars must accompany each wholesaler's license application or license renewal application. If a wholesaler sells or intends to sell cigarettes at two or more places of business, whether established or temporary, a separate license with a license fee of one hundred fifteen dollars is required for each additional place of business. Each license, or certificate thereof, and such other evidence of license as the department of revenue requires, must be exhibited in the place of business for which it is issued and in such manner as is prescribed for the display of a business license issued under chapter 19.02 RCW. The board must require each licensed wholesaler to file with the department of revenue a bond in an amount not less than one thousand dollars to guarantee the proper performance of the duties and the discharge of the liabilities under this chapter. The bond must be executed by such licensed wholesaler as principal, and by a corporation approved by the department of revenue and authorized to engage in business as a surety company in this state, as surety. The bond must run concurrently with the wholesaler's license.</p>
