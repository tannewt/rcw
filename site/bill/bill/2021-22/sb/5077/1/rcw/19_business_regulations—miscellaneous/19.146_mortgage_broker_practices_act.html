<p>The legislature finds and declares that the brokering of residential real estate loans substantially affects the public interest, requiring that all actions in mortgage brokering be actuated by good faith, and that mortgage brokers, designated brokers, loan originators, and other persons subject to this chapter abstain from deception, and practice honesty and equity in all matters relating to their profession. The practices of mortgage brokers and loan originators have had significant impact on the citizens of the state and the banking and real estate industries. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a state system of licensure in addition to rules of practice and conduct of mortgage brokers and loan originators to promote honesty and fair dealing with citizens and to preserve public confidence in the lending and real estate community.</p>

<p>Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, each applicant for a mortgage broker's license must file and maintain a surety bond, in an amount which the director deems adequate to protect the public interest, executed by the applicant as obligor and by a surety company authorized to do a surety business in this state as surety. The bonding requirement as established by the director must take the form of a range of bond amounts which vary according to the annual loan origination volume of the licensee. The bond must run to the state of Washington as obligee, and must run first to the benefit of the borrower and then to the benefit of the state and any person or persons who suffer loss by reason of the applicant's or its loan originator's violation of any provision of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter. The bond must be conditioned that the obligor as licensee will faithfully conform to and abide by this chapter and all rules adopted under this chapter, and must reimburse all persons who suffer loss by reason of a violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter. Borrowers must be given priority over the state and other persons. The state and other third parties must be allowed to receive distribution pursuant to a valid claim against the remainder of the bond. In the case of claims made by any person or entity who is not a borrower, no final judgment may be entered prior to one hundred eighty days following the date the claim is filed. The bond must be continuous and may be canceled by the surety upon the surety giving written notice to the director of its intent to cancel the bond. The cancellation must be effective thirty days after the notice is received by the director. Whether or not the bond is renewed, continued, reinstated, reissued, or otherwise extended, replaced, or modified, including increases or decreases in the penal sum, it is considered one continuous obligation, and the surety upon the bond is not liable in an aggregate or cumulative amount exceeding the penal sum set forth on the face of the bond. In no event is the penal sum, or any portion thereof, at two or more points in time be added together in determining the surety's liability. The bond is not be [is not] liable for any penalties imposed on the licensee , including, but not limited to, any increased damages or attorneys' fees, or both, awarded under RCW 19.86.090. The applicant may obtain the bond directly from the surety or through a group bonding arrangement involving a professional organization comprised of mortgage brokers if the arrangement provides at least as much coverage as is required under this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the director determines that the bond required in (a) of this subsection is not reasonably available, the director must waive the requirements for such a bond. The mortgage recovery fund account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. The director is authorized to charge fees to fund the account. All fees charged under this section, except those retained by the director for administration of the account, must be deposited into the mortgage recovery fund account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for the same purposes as the surety bond as described in (a) of this subsection. Only the director or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. A person entitled to receive payment from the mortgage recovery account may only receive reimbursement after a court of competent jurisdiction has determined the actual damages caused by the licensee. The director may determine by rule the procedure for recovery; the amount each mortgage broker must pay through the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry for deposit in the mortgage recovery account; and the amount necessary to administer the account.</p>

<p>For the purposes of investigating violations or complaints arising under this chapter, the director may at any time, either personally or by a designee, investigate the business, including but not limited to the books, accounts, records, and files used therein, of every licensee and of every person engaged in the business of mortgage brokering, whether such a person acts or claims to act under, or without the authority of, this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director may visit, either personally or by designee, the licensee's place or places of business to conduct an examination. The scope of the examination is limited to documents and information necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and attendant rules. In general, the examination scope may include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A review for trust accounting compliance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loan file review to determine the mortgage broker's compliance with this chapter and applicable federal regulations covering the business of mortgage brokering and lending;</p>

<li>
<p>Interviews for the purpose of understanding business and solicitation practices, transactional events, disclosure compliance, complaint resolution, or determining specific compliance with this chapter and the attendant rules; and</p>

<p>A review of general business books and records, including employee records, for the purpose of determining specific compliance with this chapter and the attendant rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of an examination is to make certain that licensees are conducting business in compliance with the law. Therefore, protocols for examination findings and corrective action directed from an examination must be established by rule of the director. To accomplish this purpose, these protocols must include the following:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the examination findings clearly identify the need to expand the scope of the examination, the director or a designee, upon five days' written notification to the licensee with an explanation of the need, may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Expand the examination review to locations other than the examined location regardless of the number of years a location has held a license; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand the time period of the examination beyond the five-year period of licensing, provided the expansion of time does not exceed a date certain identified in the written notification in this subsection.</p>

<li>
<p>The director or a designee may consider reports made by independent certified professionals for the mortgage broker covering the same general subject matter as the examination. The director or a designee may incorporate all or part of the report in the report of the examination.</p>
