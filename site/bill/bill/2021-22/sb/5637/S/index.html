<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The public should know about forest practices in the state and needs access to information. The legislature also finds that the forestland owners subject to the forest practices act in the state benefit from having a data system that reflects the forest practices that they conduct as it allows for public involvement in protecting public resources and allowing for a viable forest products industry. The department of natural resources manages an information system that allows for public review of proposed forest practices and that system is in need of an upgrade and maintenance. It is the intent of the legislature to have landowners who submit forest applications and notification to share in covering the cost of the upgrade as well as provide revenue to support the ongoing maintenance of the new forest practices online review system through increased fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additional revenue raised from fees must be used to help cover the cost of the new data system upgrade as well as cover the full cost of ongoing maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost of implementing the forest practices program, including the forest practices online review system, increases over time and the department should have the ability to increase fees consistent with established fiscal growth factors to help cover the increased costs.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>(A) The fee for applications and notifications  submitted to the department <strong>is $165</strong> for class II applications and notifications, class III applications, and class IV forest practices that have a potential for a substantial impact on the environment and therefore require an evaluation by the department as to whether or not a detailed statement must be prepared pursuant to the state environmental policy act, chapter 43.21C RCW, when the application or notification is submitted by a landowner who satisfies the definition of small forestland owner provided in RCW 76.09.450 and the application or notification applies to a single contiguous ownership consisting of one or more parcels;</p>
