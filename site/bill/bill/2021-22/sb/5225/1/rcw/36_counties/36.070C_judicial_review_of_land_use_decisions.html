<p>The purpose of this chapter is to reform the process for judicial review of land use decisions made by local jurisdictions, by establishing uniform, expedited appeal procedures and uniform criteria for reviewing such decisions, in order to provide consistent, predictable, and timely judicial review.</p>
<p>[ <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1995-96/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1724-S.SL.pdf?cite=1995%20c%20347%20%C2%A7%20702">1995 c 347 § 702</a>; ]</p>

<p>Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Energy overlay zone&quot; means a formal plan enacted by the county legislative authority that establishes suitable areas for siting renewable resource projects based on currently available resources and existing infrastructure with sensitivity to adverse environmental impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Land use decision&quot; means a final determination by a local jurisdiction's body or officer with the highest level of authority to make the determination, including those with authority to hear appeals, on:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An application for a project permit or other governmental approval required by law before real property may be improved, developed, modified, sold, transferred, or used, but excluding applications for permits or approvals to use, vacate, or transfer streets, parks, and similar types of public property; excluding applications for legislative approvals such as area-wide rezones and annexations; and excluding applications for business licenses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interpretative or declaratory decision regarding the application to a specific property of zoning or other ordinances or rules regulating the improvement, development, modification, maintenance, or use of real property; and</p>
</li>
<li>

However, when a local jurisdiction is required by law to enforce the ordinances in a court of limited jurisdiction, a petition may not be brought under this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Where a local jurisdiction allows or requires a motion for reconsideration to the highest level of authority making the determination, and a timely motion for reconsideration has been filed, the land use decision occurs on the date a decision is entered on the motion for reconsideration, and not the date of the original decision for which the motion for reconsideration was filed.</p>

<li>
<p>For land use decisions other than those described in subsection (1) of this section, the record for judicial review may be supplemented by evidence of material facts that were not made part of the local jurisdiction's record.</p>

<li>
<p>The court may require or permit corrections of ministerial errors or inadvertent omissions in the preparation of the record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parties may not conduct pretrial discovery except with the prior permission of the court, which may be sought by motion at any time after service of the petition. The court shall not grant permission unless the party requesting it makes a prima facie showing of need. The court shall strictly limit discovery to what is necessary for equitable and timely review of the issues that are raised under subsections (2) and (3) of this section. If the court allows the record to be supplemented, the court shall require the parties to disclose before the hearing or trial on the merits the specific evidence they intend to offer. If any party, or anyone acting on behalf of any party, requests records under chapter 42.56 RCW relating to the matters at issue, a copy of the request shall simultaneously be given to all other parties and the court shall take such request into account in fashioning an equitable discovery order under this section.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The superior court, acting without a jury, shall review the record and such supplemental evidence as is permitted under RCW 36.70C.120. The court may grant relief only if the party seeking relief has carried the burden of establishing that one of the standards set forth in (a) through (f) of this subsection has been met. The standards are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The body or officer that made the land use decision engaged in unlawful procedure or failed to follow a prescribed process, unless the error was harmless;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The land use decision is an erroneous interpretation of the law, after allowing for such deference as is due the construction of a law by a local jurisdiction with expertise;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The land use decision is not supported by evidence that is substantial when viewed in light of the whole record before the court;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The land use decision is a clearly erroneous application of the law to the facts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The land use decision is outside the authority or jurisdiction of the body or officer making the decision; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The land use decision violates the constitutional rights of the party seeking relief.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to grant relief under this chapter, it is not necessary for the court to find that the local jurisdiction engaged in arbitrary and capricious conduct. A grant of relief by itself may not be deemed to establish liability for monetary damages or compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land use decisions made by a local jurisdiction concerning renewable resource projects within a county energy overlay zone are presumed to be reasonable if they are in compliance with the requirements and standards established by local ordinance for that zone. However, for land use decisions concerning wind power generation projects, either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The local ordinance for that zone is consistent with the department of fish and wildlife's wind power guidelines; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local jurisdiction prepared an environmental impact statement under chapter 43.21C RCW on the energy overlay zone; and</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The local ordinance for that zone requires project mitigation, as addressed in the environmental impact statement and consistent with local, state, and federal law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local ordinance for that zone requires site specific fish and wildlife and cultural resources analysis; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local jurisdiction has adopted an ordinance that addresses critical areas under chapter 36.70A RCW.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a local jurisdiction has taken action and adopted local ordinances consistent with subsection (3)(b) of this section, then wind power generation projects permitted consistently with the energy overlay zone are deemed to have adequately addressed their environmental impacts as required under chapter 43.21C RCW.</p>
