Immediately below the lettering identifying the public entity and agency operating the vehicle or below an approved insignia shall appear the words &quot;for official use only&quot; in letters at least one inch high in a color contrasting with the color of the vehicle. The appropriate governing body may provide by rule or ordinance for marking of passenger motor vehicles as prescribed in subsection (2) of this section or for exceptions to the marking requirements for local governmental agencies for the same purposes and under the same circumstances as permitted for state agencies under subsection (3) of this section.</p>

Markings must be on a transparent adhesive material and conform to the standards established by the department of enterprise services. For the purposes of this section, &quot;passenger motor vehicles&quot; means sedans, station wagons, vans, light trucks, or other motor vehicles under ten thousand pounds gross vehicle weight.</p>

The exceptions in this subsection, subsection (4) of this section, and those provided for in RCW 46.08.066 shall be the only exceptions permitted to the requirements of subsection (2) of this section.</p>
