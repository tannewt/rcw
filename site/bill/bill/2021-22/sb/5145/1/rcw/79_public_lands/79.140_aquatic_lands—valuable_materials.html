<p>The financial and technical ability of the bidder to perform the contract;</p>

<p>Whether the bidder was the &quot;highest responsible bidder&quot; for a sale within the previous five years but failed to complete the sale, such as by not entering into a resulting contract or by not paying the difference between the deposit and the total amount due. However, sales that were bid prior to January 1, 2003, may not be considered for the purposes of this subsection (1)(d);</p>

<p>Sales by public auction under this chapter shall be conducted under the direction of the department, by its authorized representative. The department's representatives are referred to as auctioneers.</p>

<p>On or before the time specified in the notice of sale each bidder shall deposit with the auctioneer, in cash or by certified check, cashier's check, or postal money order payable to the order of the department, or by bid guarantee in the form of bid bond acceptable to the department, an amount equal to the deposit specified in the notice of sale. The deposit shall include a specified amount of the appraised price for the valuable materials offered for sale, together with any fee required by law for the issuance of contracts or bills of sale. The deposit may, when prescribed in the notice of sale, be considered an opening bid of an amount not less than the minimum appraised price established in the notice of sale. The successful bidder's deposit will be retained by the auctioneer and the difference, if any, between the deposit and the total amount due shall on the day of the sale be paid in cash, certified check, cashier's check, draft, postal money order, or by personal check made payable to the department. If a bid bond is used, the share of the total deposit due guaranteed by the bid bond shall, within ten days of the day of sale, be paid in cash, certified check, cashier's check, draft, or postal money order payable to the department. Other deposits, if any, shall be returned to the respective bidders at the conclusion of each sale.</p>

<p>When gravel, rock, sand, silt, or other material from any state-owned aquatic lands is removed by any public agency or under public contract for channel or harbor improvement, or flood control, use of the material may be authorized by the department for a public purpose on land owned or leased by the state or any municipality, county, or public corporation. However, when no public land site is available for deposit of the material, its deposit on private land with the landowner's permission is authorized and may be designated by the department to be for a public purpose. Prior to removal and use, the state agency, municipality, county, or public corporation contemplating or arranging the use shall first obtain written permission from the department. No payment of royalty shall be required for the gravel, rock, sand, silt, or other material used for the public purpose, but a charge will be made if the material is subsequently sold or used for some other purpose. Further, the department may authorize the public agency or private landowner to dispose of the material without charge when necessary to implement disposal of material. No charge shall be required for any use of the material obtained under the provisions of this chapter when used solely on an authorized site. No charge shall be required for any use of the material obtained under the provisions of this chapter if the material is used for public purposes by local governments. Public purposes include, but are not limited to, construction and maintenance of roads, dikes, and levies. Nothing in this section shall repeal or modify the provisions of *RCW 77.55.100 or eliminate the necessity of obtaining a permit for the removal from other state or federal agencies as otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that an extraordinary volume of material washed down onto beds of navigable waters and shorelands in the Toutle river, Coweeman river, and portions of the Cowlitz river following the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the owners of private lands located near the impacted rivers were authorized to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any dredge spoils removed from the river between the years of 1980 and 1995 without the necessity of any charge by the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the dredging activities following the eruption of Mount St. Helens are no longer adequate to protect engineered structures on the affected rivers or the public health and safety of the communities located in proximity to the affected rivers. Future river dredging will be necessary as part of managing the post-eruption state of the rivers, and with the commencement of new dredging activities, the underlying conditions leading to the previous authority for private landowners to dispose of the dredged materials without the necessity of any charge by the department are replicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that just as between the years of 1980 and 1995, the dredge spoils placed upon adjacent publicly and privately owned property in the affected areas, if further disposed, will be of nominal value to the state and that it is in the best interests of the state to allow further disposal without charge.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All dredge spoil or materials removed from the state-owned beds and shores of the Toutle river, Coweeman river, and that portion of the Cowlitz river from two miles above the confluence of the Toutle river to its mouth deposited on adjacent public and private lands before December 31, 2035, as a result of dredging the affected rivers for navigation and flood control purposes that as of June 10, 2010, have not been sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by owners of the lands, may be sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of by owners of the lands without the necessity of any charge by the department and free and clear of any interest of the department.</p>
