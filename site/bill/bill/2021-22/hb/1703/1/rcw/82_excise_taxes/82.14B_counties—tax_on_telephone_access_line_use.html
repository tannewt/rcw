<p>The legislature finds that the state and counties should be provided with an additional revenue source to fund  911 emergency communications systems throughout the state on a multicounty or countywide basis. The legislature further finds that the most efficient and appropriate method of deriving additional revenue for this purpose is to impose an excise tax on the use of switched access lines, radio access lines, and interconnected voice over internet protocol service lines.</p>

<p>The department must administer and adopt rules as may be necessary to enforce and administer the state and county  911 excise taxes imposed or authorized by this chapter. Chapter 82.32 RCW, with the exception of RCW 82.32.045, 82.32.145, and 82.32.380, applies to the administration, collection, and enforcement of the state and county  911 excise taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state and county  911 excise taxes imposed or authorized by this chapter, along with reports and returns on forms prescribed by the department, are due at the same time the taxpayer reports other taxes under RCW 82.32.045. If no other taxes are reported under RCW 82.32.045, the taxpayer must remit tax on an annual basis in accordance with RCW 82.32.045.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may relieve any taxpayer or class of taxpayers from the obligation of remitting monthly and may require the return to cover other longer reporting periods, but in no event may returns be filed for a period greater than one year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state and county  911 excise taxes imposed or authorized by this chapter are in addition to any taxes imposed upon the same persons under chapters 82.08, 82.12, and 82.14 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>Counties imposing the  911 excise tax under RCW 82.14B.030 must contract with the department for the administration and collection of the tax.
