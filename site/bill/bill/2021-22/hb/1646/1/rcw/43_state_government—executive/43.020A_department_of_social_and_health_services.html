<p>The department of social and health services is designed to integrate and coordinate all those activities involving provision of care for individuals who, as a result of their economic, social or health condition, require financial assistance, institutional care, rehabilitation or other social and health services. In order to provide for maximum efficiency of operation consistent with meeting the needs of those served or affected, the department will encompass substantially all of the powers, duties and functions vested by law on June 30, 1970, in the department of public assistance, the department of institutions, the veterans' rehabilitation council and the division of vocational rehabilitation of the coordinating council on occupational education. The department will concern itself with changing social needs, and will expedite the development and implementation of programs designed to achieve its goals. In furtherance of this policy, it is the legislative intent to set forth only the broad outline of the structure of the department, leaving specific details of its internal organization and management to those charged with its administration.</p>

<p>Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an individual provider or home care agency provider who has resided in the state less than three years before applying for employment involving unsupervised access to a vulnerable adult as defined in chapter 74.34 RCW must be fingerprinted for the purpose of investigating conviction records through both the Washington state patrol and the federal bureau of investigation.

<li>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department of social and health services reviewed the person's otherwise disqualifying criminal history through the department of social and health services' background assessment review team process conducted in 2002 and determined that such person could remain in a position covered by this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conviction is no longer automatically disqualifying pursuant to RCW 43.20A.715;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applicant has received a certificate of restoration of opportunity for the convictions pursuant to RCW 9.97.020, and the department of social and health services has not disqualified the applicant based on character, competence, and suitability review; or</p>

<li>
<p>The conviction or disposition has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, or other equivalent procedure.</p>

<p>Any program that provides domestic violence treatment to perpetrators of domestic violence must be certified by the department of social and health services and meet minimum standards for domestic violence treatment purposes. The department of social and health services shall adopt rules for standards of approval of domestic violence perpetrator programs. The treatment must meet the following minimum qualifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All treatment must be based upon a full, complete clinical intake including but not limited to: Current and past violence history; a lethality risk assessment; history of treatment from past domestic violence perpetrator treatment programs; a complete diagnostic evaluation; a substance abuse assessment; criminal history; assessment of cultural issues, learning disabilities, literacy, and special language needs; and a treatment plan that adequately and appropriately addresses the treatment needs of the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate communication necessary for periodic safety checks and case monitoring, the program must require the perpetrator to sign the following releases:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A release for the program to inform the victim and victim's community and legal advocates that the perpetrator is in treatment with the program, and to provide information, for safety purposes, to the victim and victim's community and legal advocates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A release to prior and current treatment agencies to provide information on the perpetrator to the program; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A release for the program to provide information on the perpetrator to relevant legal entities including: Lawyers, courts, parole, probation, child protective services, and child welfare services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment must be for a minimum treatment period defined by the secretary of the department of social and health services by rule. The weekly treatment sessions must be in a group unless there is a documented, clinical reason for another modality. Any other therapies, such as individual, marital, or family therapy, substance abuse evaluations or therapy, medication reviews, or psychiatric interviews, may be concomitant with the weekly group treatment sessions described in this section but not a substitute for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treatment must focus primarily on ending the violence, holding the perpetrator accountable for his or her violence, and changing his or her behavior. The treatment must be based on nonvictim-blaming strategies and philosophies and shall include education about the individual, family, and cultural dynamics of domestic violence. If the perpetrator or the victim has a minor child, treatment must specifically include education regarding the effects of domestic violence on children, such as the emotional impacts of domestic violence on children and the long-term consequences that exposure to incidents of domestic violence may have on children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Satisfactory completion of treatment must be contingent upon the perpetrator meeting specific criteria, defined by rule by the secretary of the department of social and health services, and not just upon the end of a certain period of time or a certain number of sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program must have policies and procedures for dealing with reoffenses and noncompliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All evaluation and treatment services must be provided by, or under the supervision of, qualified personnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of the department of social and health services may adopt rules and establish fees as necessary to implement this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of social and health services may conduct on-site monitoring visits as part of its plan for certifying domestic violence perpetrator programs and monitoring implementation of the rules adopted by the secretary of the department of social and health services to determine compliance with the minimum qualifications for domestic violence perpetrator programs. The applicant or certified domestic violence perpetrator program shall cooperate fully with the department of social and health services in the monitoring visit and provide all program and management records requested by the department of social and health services to determine the program's compliance with the minimum certification qualifications and rules adopted by the department of social and health services.</p>
