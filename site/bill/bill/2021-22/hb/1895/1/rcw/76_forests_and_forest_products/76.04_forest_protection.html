<li>
<p>The department may, at its discretion, appoint trained personnel possessing the necessary qualifications to carry out the duties and supporting functions of the department and may determine their respective salaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall have direct charge of and supervision of all matters pertaining to the forest fire service of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enforce all laws within this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be empowered to take charge of and, consistent with RCW 76.04.021, direct the work of suppressing forest fires;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Investigate the origin and cause of all forest fires to determine whether either a criminal act or negligence by any person, firm, or corporation caused the starting, spreading, or existence of the fire. In conducting investigations, the department shall work cooperatively, to the extent possible, with utilities, property owners, and other interested parties to identify and preserve evidence. Except as provided otherwise in this subsection, the department in conducting investigations is authorized, without court order, to take possession or control of relevant evidence found in plain view and belonging to any person, firm, or corporation. To the extent possible, the department shall notify the person, firm, or corporation of its intent to take possession or control of the evidence. The person, firm, or corporation shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to view the evidence and, before the department takes possession or control of the evidence, also shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to examine, document, and photograph it. If the person, firm, or corporation objects in writing to the department's taking possession or control of the evidence, the department must either return the evidence within seven days after the day on which the department is provided with the written objections or obtain a court order authorizing the continued possession or control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absent a court order authorizing otherwise, the department may not take possession or control of evidence over the objection of the owner of the evidence if the evidence is used by the owner in conducting a business or in providing an electric utility service and the department's taking possession or control of the evidence would substantially and materially interfere with the operation of the business or provision of electric utility service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absent a court order authorizing otherwise, the department may not take possession or control of evidence over the objection of an electric utility when the evidence is not owned by the utility but has caused damage to property owned by the utility. However, this subsection (3)(c)(iii) does not apply if the department has notified the utility of its intent to take possession or control of the evidence and provided the utility with reasonable time to examine, document, and photograph the evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only personnel qualified to work on electrical equipment may take possession or control of evidence owned or controlled by an electric utility;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furnish notices or information to the public calling attention to forest fire dangers and the penalties for violation of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be familiar with all timbered and cut-over areas of the state, areas where forest health treatments were undertaken on state, federal, or private land, public general transportation roads and public and private logging roads, water bodies, and other features on the landscape relevant in planning a fire response and include those features on a geographic information system for use by fire response personnel to assist in response decision making;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximize the effective utilization of local fire suppression assets consistent with RCW 76.04.181; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulate and control the official actions of its employees, the wardens, and the rangers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Authorize all needful and proper expenditures for forest protection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt rules consistent with this section for the prevention, control, and suppression of forest fires as it considers necessary including but not limited to: Fire equipment and materials; use of personnel; and fire prevention standards and operating conditions including a provision for reducing these conditions where justified by local factors such as location and weather;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove at will the commission of any ranger or suspend the authority of any warden;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inquire into:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The extent, kind, value, and condition of all timberlands within the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which timberlands are being destroyed by fire and the damage thereon;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide fire detection, prevention, presuppression, or suppression services on nonforested public lands managed by the department or another state agency, but only to the extent that providing these services does not interfere with or detract from the obligations set forth in subsection (3) of this section. If the department provides fire detection, prevention, presuppression, or suppression services on nonforested public lands managed by another state agency, the department must be fully reimbursed for the work through a cooperative agreement as provided for in RCW 76.04.135(1).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any rules adopted under this section for the suppression of forest fires must include a mechanism by which a local fire mobilization radio frequency, consistent with RCW 43.43.963, is identified and made available during the initial response to any forest fire that crosses jurisdictional lines so that all responders have access to communications during the response. Different initial response frequencies may be identified and used as appropriate in different geographic response areas. If the fire radio communication needs escalate beyond the capability of the identified local radio frequency, the use of other available designated interoperability radio frequencies may be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the department considers it to be in the best interest of the state, it may cooperate with any agency of another state, the United States or any agency thereof, the Dominion of Canada or any agency or province thereof, and any county, town, corporation, individual, or Indian tribe within the state of Washington in forest firefighting and patrol.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that forestlands within the state are increasingly being used for residential purposes; that the risk to life and property is increasing from forest fires which may destroy developed property; that, based on the primary missions for the respective fire control agencies established in this chapter, adjustment of the geographic areas of responsibility has not kept pace with the increasing use of forestlands for residential purposes; and that the department should work with the state's other fire control agencies to define geographic areas of responsibility that are more consistent with their respective primary missions.</p>

<li>
<p>To accomplish the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, the department shall establish a procedure to clarify its geographic areas of responsibility. The areas of department protection shall be called forest protection zones. The forest protection zones shall include all forestland which the department is obligated to protect but shall not include forestland within rural fire districts or municipal fire districts which affected local fire control agencies agree, by mutual consent with the department, is not appropriate for department protection.

<p>The legislature hereby finds and declares that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Forest wildfires are a threat to public health and safety and can cause catastrophic damage to public and private resources, including clean air, clean water, fish and wildlife habitat, timber resources, forest soils, scenic beauty, recreational opportunities, economic and employment opportunities, structures, and other improvements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forestland owners and the public have a shared interest in protecting forests and forest resources by preventing and suppressing forest wildfires;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recent independent analysis of the state fire program considered it imperative to restore a more equitable split between the general fund and forest protection assessments;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without a substantial increase in forest protection funds, the state's citizens will be paying much more money for emergency fire suppression; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is therefore the intent of the legislature that the costs of fire protection be equitably shared between the forest protection assessment account and state contributions to ensure that there will be sufficient firefighters who are equipped and trained to respond quickly to fires in order to keep fires small and manage those large fires that do occur. In recognition of increases in landowner assessments, the legislature declares its intent that increases in the state's share for forest protection should be provided to stabilize the funding for the forest protection program, and that sufficient state funds should be committed to the forest protection program so that the recommendations contained in the 1997 tridata report can be implemented on an equitable basis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature hereby finds and declares that it is in the public interest to establish and maintain a complete, cooperative, and coordinated forest fire protection and suppression program for the state; that, second only to saving lives, the primary mission of the department is protecting forest resources and suppressing forest wildfires; that a primary mission of rural fire districts and municipal fire departments is protecting improved property and suppressing structural fires; and that the most effective way to protect structures is for the department to focus its efforts and resources on aggressively suppressing forest wildfires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature also acknowledges the natural role of fire in forest ecosystems, and finds and declares it in the public interest to use fire under controlled conditions to prevent wildfires by maintaining healthy forests and eliminating sources of fuel.</p>

<p>To maximize the effective utilization of local fire suppression assets, the department is required to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Actively engage in ongoing prefire season outreach and recruitment of qualified wildland fire suppression contractors and equipment owners who have valid incident qualifications for the type of contracted work to be performed and compile and annually update a master list of the qualified contractors.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Over the last decade, forestland and rangeland wildfires have grown larger and increased in intensity and destructiveness throughout Washington state. The annual acres burned in our state illustrates this alarming trend. In the 1990s, an average of 86,000 acres burned annually. In the 2000s, the average annual acres burned increased to 189,000. In the last five years, the annual average grew to more than 488,000 acres burned. This trajectory of escalation continued last year, with wildfires burning more than 812,000 acres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recent wildfires have devastated state, federal, tribal, and private lands, destroyed homes and property, and taken lives. These fires have also released greenhouse gases, destroyed critical fish and wildlife habitat, filled our skies with harmful smoke, polluted our waters, damaged our economy, increased the risk of flooding and landslides, created a critical need for reforestation, and threatened the natural resources needed for essential industries and rural economies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catastrophic wildfires have significant negative impacts on fish and wildlife habitat, including the loss and degradation of places to shelter and feed, water quality and quantity, and soil nutrients. Washington's fish and wildlife are part of a fire-adapted landscape, but catastrophic wildfires threaten their health and recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increase in these uncharacteristic wildfires are the result of a combination of climate change-driven drought, hotter temperature, and windstorms; human development patterns and land use planning and activities; and where uncharacteristic fires occur in forests, by past fire suppression and departures from native ecosystem structure and function. Uncharacteristic wildfire risk is addressed through scientifically informed landscape-level treatments designed to restore forest ecosystem and watershed resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wildfires result in significant greenhouse gas emissions. Wildfires have become one of the largest sources of black carbon in the last five years. From 2014-2018, wildfires in Washington state generated 39.2 million metric tons of carbon, the equivalent of more than 8.5 million cars on the road a year. In 2015, when 1.13 million acres burned in Washington, wildfires were the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, second only to transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature has recognized our forests, as well as the manufacturing and utilization of wood products, as a natural carbon solution and critical component of our state's carbon reduction strategy pursuant to chapter 120, Laws of 2020. Uncharacteristic wildfires threaten the ability of our forests to sequester carbon, and they threaten the stability and long-term viability of our forest products industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington state department of natural resources' 20-year forest health strategic plan and climate risk assessment finds that carbon emissions from wildfires are anticipated to increase if there is no change in forest management practices. Unless the state significantly increases active forest management across land ownerships to reduce the risk and intensity of wildfires, wildfire emissions will erode efforts to achieve our state's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. In addition to reducing fuel loads, many effective forest health treatments retain and restore older, large fire-resilient trees across the landscape that play an important role in carbon sequestration, enhancing climate resilience and ecosystem services, and mitigating climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wildfires inflict huge costs to the state budget, the budgets of partner agencies, and our economy. From 2014-2019, agencies in Washington annually spent nearly $150 million fighting wildfires. In 2015, firefighting costs were more than $342 million. In 2019, firefighting costs were more than $172 million. And suppression costs are only a small portion of the full economic impact. According to a 2018 report by the nonprofit headwater's economics, suppression costs account for only nine percent of the total cost of wildfires when factoring in disaster recovery, lost business, lost infrastructure, and timber damage, and public health impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over one-half of Washington is forested, providing significant environmental and economic value. Over $4,900,000,000 in wages and $200,000,000 in taxes are paid by the forest products' sector each year. Opportunities exist to boost our rural economies through wildfire preparation and preparedness that maintain and attract private sector investments and employment in rural communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wildfires are significant threats to life and property. Over the last five years, wildfires in Washington have taken five lives, including four firefighters and the life of a one-year old boy. In 2020 alone, 298 homes were destroyed by wildfires in our state. More than 1,100 homes have been destroyed this decade. Communities in every corner of Washington have felt the impact and devastation of flames and smoke. In 2020, the town of Malden, Washington was forever scarred by rangeland wildfire. Approximately 80 percent of the town's structures burned down in the Babb Road fire, including the city hall, post office, and fire station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wildfire smoke has significant negative impacts on public health. For the second time in the last three years, Washington state had the worst air quality in the world due to wildfires. Communities in every corner of the state felt the impact. Exposure to particulate matter in wildfire smoke has been associated with a wide range of damaging health effects. The particulates in this smoke make those breathing the air wheeze, cough, shorten their breath, and experience sore eyes and throats, diminishing health and quality of life. Other adverse health outcomes are more severe, including increases in asthma-related hospitalizations, chronic and acute respiratory and cardiovascular health problems, and premature death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historical forest management, legacy wildfire suppression responses, and a rapidly changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic wildfires throughout the state. It is the policy of the state to encourage prudent and responsible forest resource management to maintain the health of forests and ecosystems in Washington state. Increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration through fuel reduction, thinning, and the use of prescribed fire on federal, state, tribal, and private lands pursuant to the 20-year forest health strategic plan, the wildland fire protection 10-year strategic plan, and RCW 79.10.520 will reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, more than 1,300,000 acres of national forest system land in eastern Washington were considered in need of treatments to restore forest health and reduce the risk of wildfire hazard potential. Many of these lands are adjacent to populated communities, private lands, and state trust lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2020, 166,000 acres of department of natural resources' land and 74,000 acres of other state-owned lands in eastern Washington were in need of forest health treatment. These forestlands provide critical fish and wildlife habitat, natural and cultural resources, recreation, raw materials for the forest industry, and funding for counties and schools. From 2011-2020, 102,700 forested acres of department of natural resources' managed trust lands have burned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tribal lands and communities have been significantly impacted by wildfires and unhealthy forests. Approximately 494,000 acres of tribal lands in eastern Washington need forest health treatments. These forestlands provide critical fish and wildlife habitat, natural and cultural resources, and economic opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Washington state has nearly eight million acres of private forestlands. Forested acres are declining statewide with a loss of 394,000 acres between 2007 and 2019. Small forestland owners account for 15 percent of total forest acres. Small forestland owner forested acres declined 3.7 percent from 2,990,000 acres in 2007 to 2,880,000 million acres in 2019. The number of small forestland owners increased 8.5 percent from 201,000 in 2007 to 218,000 in 2019. The number of small forestland owner parcels increased 2.1 percent from 256,500 to 261,800. This rapid land use change creates significant challenges for implementing forest health and wildfire response actions in the wildland urban interface. In eastern Washington alone, approximately 288,000 acres owned by small forestland owners are in need of immediate forest health treatment. These forestlands provide critical raw materials for the forest industry, rural economic opportunities, fish and wildlife habitat, cultural resources, and recreation. A coordinated interagency response is needed to address the multifaceted challenge posed by increasing parcelization, forest fragmentation, loss of economic viability, and changes in landowner assistance needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that increasing the pace and scale of science-based forest health activities to reduce hazardous fuels and restore fire resilient forests, including through mechanical thinning and prescribed burning, on federal, state, tribal, and private lands, will reduce the risk and severity of wildfires, protect cultural and archaeological resources, improve fish and wildlife habitat, expand recreational opportunities, protect air and water quality, create rural economic opportunities, provide critical wood products, and increase long-term carbon sequestration on our natural resource lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased development in the wildland urban interface has also increased the number of people living in areas that are at risk of wildfire. In Washington, over 2,000,000 homes are currently at risk of wildfire. Communities and homeowners can take actions that reduce the risk of loss in the event of wildfire including, but not limited to, home hardening, creating defensible space, and building potential control lines or strategic fuel breaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term, sustainable investment in wildfire response, forest restoration, and community resilience is of utmost importance to the health and safety of our environment, our economy, our communities, and the well-being of every resident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to take immediate action to fully fund the wildland fire protection 10-year strategic plan. Strategies to accomplish these goals include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Upgrading our capability to attack wildfires with critical air and ground resources;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing needed wildfire resources to state wildfire response and local fire service districts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with each state utility, local publicly owned electric utility, and electrical cooperative to reduce wildfire risk and develop consistent approaches and shared data related to fire prevention, safety, vegetation management, and energy distribution systems; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving wildfire detection in areas at risk of wildfire through new technologies and equipment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature to take immediate action to increase the pace and scale of forest management across different land ownerships and fully fund the 20-year forest health strategic plan and activities developed to facilitate implementation of the Washington state forest action plan. Strategies to accomplish these goals include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Restoring to health a minimum of 1,250,000 acres of forestland in need of immediate action to become more resilient and improve watershed health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing prescribed fire and other fuel reduction projects through proven forestry practices and the operation of prescribed fire crews;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing potential control lines and strategic fuel breaks around communities with high wildfire risk;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing funding for the small forestland owner office for technical assistance and support for small forestland owners and funding an integrated small forestland owner forest health program in support of extending management and control of wildfire from homes through the wildland urban interface to small forestland owner holdings; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring forest health conditions and effectiveness of treatments throughout the state, including ecological function and reducing catastrophic wildfires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature to take immediate action to help communities become more resilient to wildfire. Strategies to accomplish these goals include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Increasing funding for cost share programs for home hardening, fuels reduction, and community resilience programs in communities at risk of wildfire;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing wildfire risk to wildland urban interfaces; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring our state's most vulnerable populations are not disproportionately burdened by the impact and consequences of wildfire.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature intends to provide $125,000,000 per biennium over the next four biennia for a total of $500,000,000 and that these investments will help protect the state's people, environment, and economy.</p>

Assessments shall be known and designated as assessments of the year in which the amounts became reimbursable. Upon the collection of assessments the county treasurer shall place fifty cents of the total assessments paid on a parcel for fire protection into the county current expense fund to defray the costs of listing, billing, and collecting these assessments. The treasurer shall then transmit the balance to the department. Collections shall be applied against expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section, including necessary and reasonable administrative costs incurred by the department in the enforcement of these provisions. The department may also expend sums collected from owners of forestlands or received from any other source for necessary administrative costs in connection with the enforcement of RCW 76.04.660.

The department may, when moneys are available from the landowner contingency forest fire suppression account, expend moneys for summarily abating, isolating, or reducing an extreme fire hazard under RCW 76.04.660. All moneys recovered as a result of the department's actions, from the owner or person responsible, under RCW 76.04.660 shall be deposited in the landowner contingency forest fire suppression account.</p>
<p>When a determination is made that the fire was started by other than a landowner operation, moneys expended from this account in the suppression of such fire shall be recovered from the general fund appropriations as may be available for emergency fire suppression costs. The department shall deposit in the landowner contingency forest fire suppression account moneys paid out of the account which are later recovered, less reasonable costs of recovery.</p>
<p>This account shall be established and renewed by an annual special forest fire suppression account assessment paid by participating landowners at a rate to be established by the department. In establishing assessments, the department shall seek to establish and thereafter reestablish a balance in the account of three million dollars. The department may establish a flat fee assessment of no more than seven dollars and fifty cents for participating landowners owning parcels of fifty acres or less. For participating landowners owning parcels larger than fifty acres, the department may charge the flat fee assessment plus a per acre assessment for every acre over fifty acres. The per acre assessment established by the department may not exceed fifteen cents per acre per year. The assessments may differ to equitably distribute the assessment based on emergency fire suppression cost experience necessitated by landowner operations. Amounts assessed for this account shall be a lien upon the forestlands with respect to which the assessment is made and may be collected as directed by the department in the same manner as forest protection assessments. Payment of emergency costs from this account shall in no way restrict the right of the department to recover costs pursuant to RCW 76.04.495 or other laws.</p>
<p>When the department determines that a forest fire was started in the course of or as a result of a landowner operation, the determination shall be final, unless, within ninety days of the notification, or an interested party serves a request for a hearing before the department. The hearing shall constitute an adjudicative proceeding under chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act, and an appeal shall be in accordance with RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.</p>

<p>The owner of land on which there is an additional fire hazard, when the hazard is the result of a landowner operation or the land is within an area covered by a forest health hazard warning issued under RCW 76.06.180, shall take reasonable measures to reduce the danger of fire spreading from the area and may abate the hazard by burning or other satisfactory means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An extreme fire hazard shall exist within areas covered by a forest health hazard order issued by the commissioner of public lands under RCW 76.06.180 in which there is an additional fire hazard caused by disturbance agents and the landowner has failed to take such action as required by the forest health hazard order. The duties and liability of such landowner under this chapter are as described in subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt rules defining areas of extreme fire hazard that the owner and person responsible shall abate. The areas shall include but are not limited to high risk areas such as where life or buildings may be endangered, areas adjacent to public highways, and areas of frequent public use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department may adopt rules defining other conditions of extreme fire hazard with a high potential for fire spreading to lands in other ownerships. The department may prescribe additional measures that shall be taken by the owner and person responsible to isolate or reduce the extreme fire hazard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The owner or person responsible for the existence of the extreme fire hazard is required to abate, isolate, or reduce the hazard. The duty to abate, isolate, or reduce, and liability under this chapter, arise upon creation of the extreme fire hazard. Liability shall include but not be limited to all fire suppression expenses incurred by the department, regardless of fire cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the owner or person responsible for the existence of the extreme fire hazard or forest debris subject to RCW 76.04.650 refuses, neglects, or unsuccessfully attempts to abate, isolate, or reduce the same, the department may summarily abate, isolate, or reduce the hazard as required by this chapter and recover twice the actual cost thereof from the owner or person responsible. Landowner contingency forest fire suppression account moneys may be used by the department, when available, for this purpose. Moneys recovered by the department pursuant to this section shall be returned to the landowner contingency forest fire suppression account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such costs shall include all salaries and expenses of people and equipment incurred therein, including those of the department. All such costs shall also be a lien upon the land enforceable in the same manner with the same effect as a mechanic's lien.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The summary action may be taken only after ten days' notice in writing has been given to the owner or reputed owner of the land on which the extreme fire hazard or forest debris subject to RCW 76.04.650 exists. The notice shall include a suggested method of abatement and estimated cost thereof. The notice shall be by personal service or by registered or certified mail addressed to the owner or reputed owner at the owner's last known place of residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A landowner or manager may make a written request to the department to inspect their property and provide a written notice that they have complied with a forest health hazard warning or forest health hazard order, or otherwise adequately abated, isolated, or reduced an additional or extreme fire hazard.

<p>Any fire on or threatening any forestland burning uncontrolled and without proper action being taken to prevent its spread, notwithstanding the origin of the fire, is a public nuisance by reason of its menace to life and property.

If the person has not suppressed the fire and the fire is on or threatening forestland within a forest protection zone, the department shall summarily suppress the fire. If the owner, lessee, other possessor of such land, or an agent or contractor of the owner, lessee, or possessor, having knowledge of the fire, has not made a reasonable effort to suppress the fire, the cost thereof may be recovered from the owner, lessee, or other possessor of the land and the cost of the work shall also constitute a lien upon the real property or chattels under the person's ownership.

For real property, the state-certified general real estate appraiser must identify and analyze all relevant characteristics and uses of the property including cultural, recreational, and environmental characteristics and uses, to the extent such characteristics or uses contribute to the fair market value of the property based on the highest and best use of the property.

<li>
<p>The department must, consistent with this section, establish a voluntary, incentive-based working and nonworking forest conservation and reforestation plan that endeavors to, by the year 2040, conserve at least 1,000,000 acres of working forestland and reforest at least 1,000,000 acres. The plan must respect the full diversity of landowner management and investment objectives and must proactively and systematically utilize or develop voluntary, incentive-based strategies that address:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The prevention of actual and potential permanent loss of working and nonworking forestland loss across the state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities to implement incentive-based carbon compensation programs for avoided conversion and reforestation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reforestation on forestland impacted by wildfire, pests, disease, landslides, land-use change, and other stressors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tree planting and increased tree canopy coverage in urban areas, prioritizing highly impacted or overburdened communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must use the plan to assess and prioritize conservation and reforestation actions each biennium. The plan must consist of three elements: Assessment; implementation; and progress review and reporting.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department must: Develop a framework to identify and prioritize working and nonworking forested areas in greatest need of conservation to prevent permanent forest loss; evaluate and promote opportunities for carbon compensation programs; identify and prioritize areas in greatest need of reforestation; and identify and prioritize urban areas lacking equitable tree canopy cover. The framework must address:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Conservation of working and nonworking forestland. Map and prioritize working and nonworking forest areas across the state based on criteria that include risk of permanent loss, or critical environmental, economic, cultural, equity, or health benefits including, but not limited to, value to local economy, carbon sequestration, landscape-level habitat connectivity, or salmon recovery and important wildlife habitat;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon sequestration. Evaluate and promote existing opportunities for carbon compensation programs and other incentive-based carbon emissions reducing programs to assist forestland owners interested in voluntarily engaging in carbon markets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reforestation. Map and prioritize historically forested areas, including postwildfire areas and areas where reforestation or afforestation efforts may support environmental restoration, local economic development, or tribal restoration objectives, and conduct an analysis of the regional reforestation pipeline, including seed collection, nursery capacity, and workforce needs, to ensure an adequate supply to meet goals and the growing public and private need based on increased wildfires, forest health, and lack of equitable urban green spaces. Reforestation analyses must also include an ecological assessment of advantages and disadvantages of intervention, as well as an evaluation of strategies that are best for maintaining and restoring ecological integrity and resilience to climate change;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urban tree canopy. Map and prioritize urban and community areas where tree planting may provide environmental, economic, or health benefits particularly to highly impacted or overburdened communities; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategic plan development. Conduct the necessary analysis for the prioritization and strategic plan development related to, but not limited to, identification and application of specific criteria to prioritize the conservation of working and nonworking forests at risk of conversion, the reforestation pipeline, updated analysis of the state's private sector logging and milling capacity, and analysis of equity and environmental justice impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must identify, prioritize, utilize, and develop voluntary tools, financing opportunities, and incentive-based activities consistent with the plan using appropriations provided for that specific purpose. The department must:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Ensure that the plan utilizes and builds upon the evaluation of economic and other drivers of forest conversion from the report to the legislature produced pursuant to chapter 457, Laws of 2019 entitled &quot;Washington's Small Forestland Owners in 2020&quot;; &quot;The Future of Washington's Forests and Forest Industries&quot; report from 2007; any relevant recommendations from the carbon sequestration advisory group's final report to the legislature in 2020 conducted pursuant to chapter 415, Laws of 2019 and the &quot;Washington Forest Ecosystem Carbon Inventory: 2002-2016&quot;; the small forestland owner work group created in the climate commitment act pursuant to section 21, chapter 316, Laws of 2021; and any relevant recommendations from the trust land transfer proviso report to the legislature, pursuant to chapter 333, Laws of 2021;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct an assessment and inventory of existing voluntary tools, financing opportunities, and incentive-based activities relevant to retaining working and nonworking forestlands, preventing permanent loss of forests, increasing reforestation, afforestation of formerly forested lands and urban tree canopy, and retaining milling infrastructure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify new, existing, or amended voluntary tools, financing opportunities, and incentive-based activities that would support the goals of the plan created under this section, including:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Utilizing tools including, but not limited to, payment for ecological services, technical or financial support to small forestland owners, tax or market incentives, conservation and working forest easements, fee simple land acquisition, or transfer of development rights;</p>
<p>(B) Identifying the limitations and barriers of existing voluntary tools, financing opportunities, and incentive-based activities, and making recommendations to improve, accelerate, or expand existing tools and incentives to maximize their effectiveness;</p>
<p>(C) Identifying new or existing voluntary tools, financing opportunities, and incentives that address underlying economic stressors that contribute to forest conversion including, but not limited to, the retention of milling infrastructure, market access, and workforce development;</p>
<p>(D) Identifying new and existing voluntary tools, financing opportunities, and incentive-based activities that give financial value to the underlying environmental, health, equity, and cultural values of working forestlands; and</p>
<p>(E) Providing support to small working forestland owners to achieve the objectives and goals they set for their working forestland; and</p>
<pre><code>    iv. Develop a pilot rapid response fund to test opportunities and barriers to acquire from willing sellers private working forestlands at imminent risk of conversion. Working forests acquired from private willing sellers must be maintained as working forests.

c. By December 1, 2022, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the department must submit a report to the office of financial management and the appropriate committees of the legislature that includes a map and justification of identified priority areas, determines an approach to monitoring that the forested acres are meeting the criteria of success established in the plan, and describes activities to be undertaken consistent with the plan. The strategic plan must be finalized and submitted to the office of financial management and the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1, 2023. Each following biennium, the department must submit a report to the legislature that reviews previous activities undertaken consistent with the plan and future activities to be undertaken to reach the goals. The biennial report must include:

    i. A list and brief summary of voluntary tools and incentives to be used in the following biennium under the plan with the requested appropriations, including relevant information from the prioritization process;

    ii. A list and brief summary of voluntary tools, financing opportunities, and incentives utilized under the plan in the preceding biennium, including total funding available, costs for the voluntary tools and incentives, and their outcomes and effectiveness, and highlight the utilization of any tools and incentives that contributed to more equitable outcomes, including equity in forestland ownership, access to green spaces, and urban tree cover canopy. The summary must include any barriers to framework implementation and legislative or administrative recommendations to address those barriers, and a comparison of the requested funding for plan implementation the previous biennium and the actual funding provided with, if possible, an analysis of the additional progress that would have been expected with full funding;

    iii. Identification of potential partnerships between the state and the forest products industry to promote the use of forest products as a way towards maintaining the state's forestland base and reaching the state's greenhouse gas emissions goals;

    iv. Identification of potential partnership opportunities between the state and federally recognized tribes, state agencies, nonprofit organizations, local governments, forestland owners, conservation districts, forest collaboratives, and community-based organizations to implement tools and activities consistent with the working and nonworking forest conservation and reforestation plan;

v. Criteria by which a forested acre can be considered to be protected from conversion to nonforestland use. The criteria must incorporate both working and nonworking forests and provide a minimum time frame under which a forested acre may be considered prevented from conversion;

vi. An update on the numbers of acres of forestland by region, both working and nonworking forestlands, including gain or loss in forested area and including, when possible, the identification of any potential reasons for significant movement in acreage in either direction;

vii. An update on the status of the state's private sector logging and milling capacity as it relates to conserving working forests, including gain or loss, and including, when possible, the identification of any potential reasons for significant movement in capacity in either direction;

viii. An update on the quantity and quality of jobs created or sustained through conservation and reforestation activities;

    ix. An update on location and acres reforested, including postburn forested areas, afforestation of formerly forested lands, and tree canopy coverage in urban and other community areas; and

x. An update on consultation with highly impacted communities by region.
