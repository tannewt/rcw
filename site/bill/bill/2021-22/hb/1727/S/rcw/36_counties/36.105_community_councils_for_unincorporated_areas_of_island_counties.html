<p>Voters of the unincorporated areas of the state are authorized to establish community councils as provided in this chapter.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to provide voters of unincorporated areas in counties with a population of over thirty thousand that are made up entirely of islands with direct input on the planning and zoning of their community by establishing a governmental mechanism to adopt proposed community comprehensive plans and proposed community zoning ordinances that are consistent with an overall guide and framework adopted by the county legislative authority. In addition, it is the purpose of this chapter to have community councils serve as forums for the discussion of local issues.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The process to create a community council shall be initiated by the filing of petitions with the county auditor of the county in which the community is located which: (a) Call for the creation of a community council; (b) set forth the boundaries for the community; (c) indicate the number of community councilmembers, which shall be five, seven, nine, or eleven; and (d) contain signatures of voters residing within the community equal in number to at least ten percent of the voters residing in the community who voted at the last state general election. The county auditor shall determine if the petitions contain a sufficient number of valid signatures and certify the sufficiency of the petitions within fifteen days of when the petitions were filed. If the petitions are certified as having sufficient valid signatures, the county auditor shall transmit the petitions and certificate to the county legislative authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county legislative authority shall hold a public hearing within the community on the creation of the proposed community council no later than sixty days after the petitions and certificate of sufficiency were transmitted to the county legislative authority. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the community for at least once a week for two consecutive weeks, with the last date of publication no more than ten days prior to the date of the public hearing. At least ten days before the public hearing, additional notice shall be posted conspicuously in at least five places within the proposed community in a manner designed to attract public attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After receiving testimony on the creation of the proposed community council, the county legislative authority may alter the boundaries of the community, but the boundaries may not be altered to reduce the number of persons living within the community by more than ten percent or below the minimum number of residents who must reside within the community at the time of the creation of the community council. If territory is added to the community, another public hearing on the proposal shall be held.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county legislative authority shall call a special election within the community to determine whether the proposed community council shall be created, and to elect the initial community councilmembers, at the next state general election occurring seventy-five or more days after the initial public hearing on the creation of the proposed community council. The community council shall be created if the ballot proposition authorizing the creation of the community is approved by a simple majority vote of the voters voting on the proposition.</p>

<p>Within ninety days of the election at which a community council is created, the county legislative authority shall adopt an ordinance establishing policies and conditions and designating portions or components of the county comprehensive plan and zoning ordinances that serve as an overall guide and framework for the development of proposed community comprehensive plans and proposed community zoning ordinances. The conditions and policies shall conform with the requirements of chapter 36.70A RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposed community comprehensive plans and proposed community zoning ordinances that are adopted by a community council shall be submitted to the county legislative authority for its review of the consistency of the proposed plans and proposed ordinances with the ordinance adopted under subsection (1) of this section.

The unamended community comprehensive plans and unamended community zoning ordinances shall remain in effect in the community until the proposed amendment has been approved as provided in this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the county legislative authority amends the ordinance it adopted under subsection (1) of this section, a community council shall be given at least one hundred twenty days to amend its community comprehensive plans and community zoning ordinances to be consistent with this amended ordinance.
