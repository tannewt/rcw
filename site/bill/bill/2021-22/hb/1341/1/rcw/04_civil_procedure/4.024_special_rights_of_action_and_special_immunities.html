<p>The legislature finds and declares application of this section to pending claims and actions clarifies existing state law rather than changes it. Public employees who paid agency or fair share fees as a condition of public employment in accordance with state law and supreme court precedent before June 27, 2018, had no legitimate expectation of receiving that money under any available cause of action. Public employers and employee organizations who relied on, and abided by, state law and supreme court precedent in deducting and accepting those fees were not liable to refund them. Agency or fair share fees paid for collective bargaining representation that employee organizations were obligated by state law to provide to public employees. Application of this section to pending claims will preserve, rather than interfere with, important reliance interests.</p>

<p>Information provided by citizens concerning potential wrongdoing is vital to effective law enforcement and the efficient operation of government.

The costs of defending against such suits can be severely burdensome. The purpose of RCW 4.24.500 through 4.24.520 is to protect individuals who make good-faith reports to appropriate governmental bodies.</p>

The agency may disclose, upon request, relevant, necessary, and accurate information to any victim or witness to the offense, any individual community member who lives near the residence where the offender resides, expects to reside, or is regularly found, and any individual who requests information regarding a specific offender; (b) for offenders classified as risk level II, the agency may also disclose relevant, necessary, and accurate information to public and private schools, child day care centers, family day care providers, public libraries, businesses and organizations that serve primarily children, women, or vulnerable adults, and neighbors and community groups near the residence where the offender resides, expects to reside, or is regularly found; (c) for offenders classified as risk level III, the agency may also disclose relevant, necessary, and accurate information to the public at large; and (d) because more localized notification is not feasible and homeless and transient offenders may present unique risks to the community, the agency may also disclose relevant, necessary, and accurate information to the public at large for offenders registered as homeless or transient.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In developing the policy, the association shall consult with representatives of the following agencies and professions: (a) The department of corrections; (b) the department of social and health services; (c) the indeterminate sentence review board; (d) the Washington state council of police officers; (e) local correctional agencies; (f) the Washington association of prosecuting attorneys; (g) the Washington public defender association; (h) the Washington association for the treatment of sexual abusers; (i) the office of the superintendent of public instruction; (j) the criminal justice training commission; (k) the Washington association of criminal defense lawyers; (l) the association of Washington cities; (m) the Washington coalition of sexual assault programs; and (n) victim advocates.</p>

Following the adoption of a model policy, the sex offender model policy work group shall conduct a series of meetings around the state with local law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice personnel to review the model policy and conduct training as needed. The sex offender model policy work group shall then be dissolved, and, when funded, the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs shall be responsible for the continued promotion of the model policy, including annual or biennial regional workshops with local law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice personnel to encourage sex offender registration, community notification, and strategies for sex offender management policies and practices that best fit the needs, characteristics, and risks of each community.</p>

The treatment provider is not liable for civil damages resulting from the reoffense of a client unless the treatment provider's acts or omissions constituted gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. This limited liability provision does not eliminate the treatment provider's duty to warn of and protect from a client's threatened violent behavior if the client communicates a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably ascertainable victim or victims. In addition to any other requirements to report violations, the sex offender treatment provider is obligated to report an offender's expressions of intent to harm or other predatory behavior, whether or not there is an ascertainable victim, in progress reports and other established processes that enable courts and supervising entities to assess and address the progress and appropriateness of treatment. This limited liability provision applies only to the conduct of certified sex offender treatment providers, and certified affiliate sex offender treatment providers who have completed at least fifty percent of the required hours under the supervision of a certified sex offender treatment provider, and not the conduct of the state.</p>

<p>Every agritourism professional must post and maintain signs that contain the warning notice specified in subsection (2) of this section. The sign must be placed in a clearly visible location at the entrance to the agritourism location and at the site of the agritourism activity. The warning notice must consist of a sign in black letters, with each letter to be a minimum of one inch in height. Every written contract entered into by an agritourism professional for the providing of professional services, instruction, or the rental of equipment to a participant, whether or not the contract involves agritourism activities on or off the location or at the site of the agritourism activity, must contain in clearly readable print the warning notice specified in subsection (2) of this section.</p>

<p>&quot;WARNING</p>
<p>Under Washington state law, there is limited liability for an injury to or death of a participant in an agritourism activity conducted at this agritourism location if such an injury or death results exclusively from the inherent risks of the agritourism activity. Inherent risks of agritourism activities include, among others, risks of injury inherent to land, equipment, and animals, as well as the potential for you to act in a negligent manner that may contribute to your injury or death. We are required to ensure that in any activity involving minor children, only age-appropriate access to activities, equipment, and animals is permitted. You are assuming the risk of participating in this agritourism activity.&quot;</p>

<li>Failure to comply with the requirements concerning warning signs and notices provided in this section prohibits an agritourism professional from invoking the privilege of immunity provided by this section, section 1, chapter 227, Laws of 2017, and RCW 4.24.830 and 4.24.832 and may be introduced as evidence in any claim for damages.</li>

<li>
<p>In any civil judicial or administrative action relating to sexual harassment or sexual assault, a nondisclosure policy or agreement that purports to limit the ability of any person to produce evidence regarding past instances of sexual harassment or sexual assault by a party to the civil action does not affect discovery or the availability of witness testimony relating to that civil action. Any provision of a nondisclosure policy or agreement including any arbitration agreement or decision that would limit, prevent, or punish such disclosure is contrary to public policy and unenforceable. However, the court or presiding officer shall enter appropriate orders upon motion of any party supported by affidavit or sworn declaration, or without motion but on the court's or presiding officer's own accord, to ensure that the identity of any person who is or is alleged to be a victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault is not made public as a result of a disclosure made under this section, unless such person consents.</p>

<li>
<p>The provisions of this section do not alter admissibility standards of evidence for the court or presiding officer to decide whether the probative value of evidence offered outweighs the potential prejudice.</p>
