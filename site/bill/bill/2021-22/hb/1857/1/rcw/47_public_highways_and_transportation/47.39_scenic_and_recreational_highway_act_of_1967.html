<p>There is hereby created a scenic and recreational highway system. Highways in this system shall be developed and maintained in accordance with general standards for state highways of comparable classification and usage.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century establishes a national &quot;scenic byway&quot; program that could benefit state and local roadways, the Washington state scenic byway designation program is revised to address state and local transportation routes. Byways in this program must be designated and maintained in accordance with the criteria developed by the department under this chapter. However, a highway so designated under RCW 47.39.069 does not become part of the scenic and recreational highway system unless approved by the legislature. Corridors within the scenic and recreational highway system that showcase the state's historic agricultural areas and promote the maintenance and enhancement of agricultural areas may be designated as agricultural scenic corridors.</p>

<li>
<p>The department, in consultation with the department of <strong>commerce</strong>, the department of natural resources, the parks and recreation commission, affected cities, towns, and counties, federally recognized tribes, regional transportation planning organizations, Washington-based automobile clubs, statewide bicycling organizations, and other interested parties, shall develop by December 31, 1999, criteria for assessing scenic byways and heritage tour routes and an appropriate method of nomination and application for the designation and removal of the designation of the byways. Factors the department may take into consideration, but is not limited by, are: (a) Scenic quality of the byway; (b) natural aspects, such as geological formations, water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife; (c) historic elements; (d) cultural features such as the arts, crafts, music, customs, or traditions of a distinct group of people; (e) archaeological features; (f) recreational activities; (g) roadway safety including accommodations for bicycle and pedestrian travel, tour buses, and automobiles; (h) scenic byway and local and regional byway management plans; and (i) local public involvement and support for the byway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The criteria developed in subsection (1) of this section must not impose nor require regulation of privately owned lands or property rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person may nominate a roadway, path, or trail for inclusion in the scenic byway program. The department shall assess nominations in accordance with the criteria developed under subsection (1) of this section. The department shall submit its recommendations for scenic byway and heritage tour route designations to the commission for its approval and official designation of the roadway, path, or trail as a scenic byway or a heritage tour route. All decisions made by the commission relating to scenic byway and heritage tour route designations are final.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall apply the criteria in subsection (1) of this section to state highways that are currently not a part of the designated scenic and recreational highway system. The department shall respond to local requests for route evaluation as defined in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the commission has designated a roadway as a scenic byway, the department may submit an individual nomination to the federal highway administration for its consideration of whether the roadway qualifies to be designated as a national scenic byway or an All-American Roadway.</p>

<p>Recognizing that the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century establishes a national &quot;Scenic Byways&quot; grant program and a new apportionment program called &quot;Transportation Enhancement Activities,&quot; the department of transportation shall place high priority on obtaining funds from those sources for further development of a scenic and recreational highways program, including enhancement projects on the designated scenic and recreational highway system. The department shall consider the use of the designated system by bicyclists and pedestrians in connection with nonmotorized routes in the state trail plan, and the state bicycle plan which are also eligible for TEA-21 funding. Appropriate signage may be used at intersections of nonmotorized and motorized systems to demonstrate the access, location, and the interconnectivity of various modes of travel for transportation and recreation. For the purposes of leveraging national scenic byway planning grant funds, the commission may designate eligible state highways as scenic byways on an interim basis.</p>

<li>
<p>The department shall determine whether a roadway designated as a national scenic byway or an All-American Roadway is being properly maintained in accordance with the roadway's byway management plan, including preserving the intrinsic qualities that originally supported the designation.

</li>
<li>
<p>Local, regional, or other governmental bodies may notify the commission of the removal of a designated route if they determine it no longer meets the designation criteria, or community support for the designation no longer exists, or it no longer possesses the intrinsic qualities that supported its original designation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State or local removal of a designated route will result in discontinued state support of the designated route and can include, but is not limited to, state matching assistance for grant applications, the removal of signs directly related to the byway, free promotional information in the state-owned safety rest areas, and inclusion in maps, brochures, and electronic media.</p>
