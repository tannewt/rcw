<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that minors in need of behavioral health care and treatment receive an appropriate continuum of culturally relevant care and treatment, including prevention and early intervention, self-directed care, parent-directed care, and involuntary treatment. To facilitate the continuum of care and treatment to minors in out-of-home placements, all divisions of the authority and the department that provide behavioral health services to minors shall jointly plan and deliver those services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the purpose of this chapter to protect the rights of adolescents to confidentiality and to independently seek services for behavioral health disorders. Mental health and substance use disorder professionals shall guard against needless hospitalization and deprivations of liberty, enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs in accordance with sound professional judgment, and encourage the use of voluntary services. Mental health and substance use disorder professionals shall, whenever clinically appropriate, offer less restrictive alternatives to inpatient treatment. Additionally, all behavioral health care and treatment providers shall assure that minors' parents are given an opportunity to participate in the treatment decisions for their minor children. The behavioral health care and treatment providers shall, to the extent possible, offer services that involve minors' parents or family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to enhance continuity of care for minors with serious behavioral health disorders that can be controlled or stabilized in a less restrictive alternative commitment. Within the guidelines stated in In re LaBelle, 107 Wn.2d 196 (1986), the legislature intends to encourage appropriate interventions at a point when there is the best opportunity to restore the minor to or maintain satisfactory functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For minors with a prior history or pattern of repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions due to decompensation, the consideration of prior behavioral health history is particularly relevant in determining whether the minor would receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the legislature finds that for minors who are currently under a commitment order, a prior history of decompensation leading to repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions should be given great weight in determining whether a new less restrictive alternative commitment should be ordered. The court must also consider any school behavioral issues, the impact on the family, the safety of other children in the household, and the developmental age of the minor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the purpose of this chapter to protect the health and safety of minors suffering from behavioral health disorders and to protect public safety through use of the parens patriae and police powers of the state. Accordingly, when construing the requirements of this chapter the court must focus on the merits of the petition, except where requirements have been totally disregarded, as provided in In re C.W., 147 Wn.2d 259, 281 (2002). A presumption in favor of deciding petitions on their merits furthers both public and private interests because the mental and physical well-being of minors as well as public safety may be implicated by the decision to release a minor and discontinue his or her treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also the purpose of this chapter to assure the ability of parents to exercise reasonable, compassionate care and control of their minor children when there is a medical necessity for treatment and without the requirement of filing a petition under this chapter, including the ability to request and receive medically necessary treatment for their adolescent children without the consent of the adolescent.</p>

<p>The authority shall assure that, for any adolescent admitted to inpatient treatment under RCW 71.34.600, a review is conducted by a physician or other mental health professional who is employed by the authority, or an agency under contract with the authority, and who neither has a financial interest in continued inpatient treatment of the adolescent nor is affiliated with the facility providing the treatment.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>For adolescents receiving inpatient treatment, the physician or other mental health professional shall conduct the review not less than seven nor more than fourteen days following the date the adolescent was brought to the facility under RCW 71.34.600 to determine whether it is a medical necessity to continue the adolescent's treatment on an inpatient basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For adolescents receiving inpatient treatment in a residential treatment facility, the physician or other mental health professional shall conduct an additional medical necessity review every thirty days after the initial review while the adolescent remains in treatment under RCW 71.34.600.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In making a determination under subsection (1) of this section, the authority shall consider the opinion of the treatment provider, the safety of the adolescent, and the likelihood the adolescent's mental health will deteriorate if released from inpatient treatment. The authority shall consult with the parent in advance of making its determination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, after any review conducted by the authority under this section, the authority determines it is no longer a medical necessity for an adolescent to receive inpatient treatment, the authority shall immediately notify the parents and the facility. The facility shall release the adolescent to the parents within twenty-four hours of receiving notice. If the professional person in charge and the parent believe that it is a medical necessity for the adolescent to remain in inpatient treatment, the adolescent shall be released to the parent on the second judicial day following the authority's determination in order to allow the parent time to file an at-risk youth petition under chapter 13.32A RCW. If the authority determines it is a medical necessity for the adolescent to receive outpatient treatment and the adolescent declines to obtain such treatment, such refusal shall be grounds for the parent to file an at-risk youth petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the evaluation conducted under RCW 71.34.600 is done by the authority, the reviews required by subsection (1) of this section shall be done by contract with an independent agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority may, subject to available funds, contract with other governmental agencies to conduct the reviews under this section. The authority may seek reimbursement from the parents, their insurance, or medicaid for the expense of any review conducted by an agency under contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the review required under this section, the authority may periodically determine and redetermine the medical necessity of treatment for purposes of payment with public funds.</p>
</li>

<p>At any time during the minor's period of fourteen-day commitment, the professional person in charge may petition the court for an order requiring the minor to undergo an additional one hundred eighty-day period of treatment.

<p>The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall contain the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The name and address of the petitioner or petitioners;</p>

<p>The date of the fourteen-day commitment order; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A summary of the facts supporting the petition.</p>

<li>
<p>The petition shall be supported by accompanying affidavits signed by: (a) Two examining physicians, one of whom shall be a child psychiatrist, or two psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioners, one of whom shall be a child and adolescent or family psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner. If the petition is for substance use disorder treatment, the petition may be signed by a substance use disorder professional instead of a mental health professional and by an advanced registered nurse practitioner instead of a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner, or two physician assistants, one of whom must be supervised by a child psychiatrist; (b) one children's mental health specialist and either an examining physician, physician assistant, or a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner; or (c) two among an examining physician, physician assistant, and a psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner, one of which needs to be a child psychiatrist, a physician assistant supervised by a child psychiatrist, or a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse practitioner. The affidavits shall describe in detail the behavior of the detained minor which supports the petition and shall state whether a less restrictive alternative to inpatient treatment is in the best interests of the minor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall be filed with the clerk of the court at least three days before the expiration of the fourteen-day commitment period. The petitioner or the petitioner's designee shall within twenty-four hours of filing serve a copy of the petition on the minor and notify the minor's attorney and the minor's parent. A copy of the petition shall be provided to such persons at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of filing, the court shall set a date within seven days for the hearing on the petition. If the hearing is not commenced within thirty days after the filing of the petition, including extensions of time requested by the detained person or his or her attorney or the court in the administration of justice under RCW 71.34.735, the minor must be released.

<li>
<p>Is suffering from a mental disorder or substance use disorder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is in need of further treatment that only can be provided in a one hundred eighty-day commitment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If commitment is for a substance use disorder, the court must find that there is an available approved substance use disorder treatment program that has adequate space for the minor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether an inpatient or less restrictive alternative commitment is appropriate, great weight must be given to evidence of a prior history or pattern of decompensation and discontinuation of treatment resulting in: (a) Repeated hospitalizations; or (b) repeated peace officer interventions resulting in juvenile charges. Such evidence may be used to provide a factual basis for concluding that the minor would not receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Empty]</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the court finds that the criteria for commitment are met and that less restrictive treatment in a community setting is not appropriate or available, the court shall order the minor committed to the custody of the director for further inpatient mental health treatment, to an approved substance use disorder treatment program for further substance use disorder treatment, or to a private treatment and evaluation facility for inpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment if the minor's parents have assumed responsibility for payment for the treatment. If the court finds that a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the minor, the court shall order less restrictive alternative treatment upon such conditions as necessary.</p>

At any hearing conducted by video, the technology used must permit the judicial officer, counsel, all parties, and the witnesses to be able to see, hear, and speak, when authorized, during the hearing; to allow attorneys to use exhibits or other materials during the hearing; and to allow the respondent's counsel to be in the same location as the respondent unless otherwise requested by the respondent or the respondent's counsel. Witnesses in a proceeding may also appear in court through other means, including telephonically, pursuant to the requirements of superior court civil rule 43. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court, upon its own motion or upon a motion for good cause by any party, may require all parties and witnesses to participate in the hearing in person rather than by video. In ruling on any such motion, the court may allow in-person or video testimony; and the court may consider, among other things, whether the respondent's alleged behavioral health disorder affects the respondent's ability to perceive or participate in the proceeding by video.</p>
