</li>
<li>
<p>After a foster parent has provided care for the child for six months, and every six months thereafter, the department shall negotiate an appropriate maintenance payment with the foster parent who is caring for a child meeting the description provided in subsection (3) of this section with the goal of maintaining stability for the child and based on factors listed in subsection (3) of this section that exist at the time the payment amount is reviewed.</p>

<p>This section modifies existing section <a href="/rcw/74_public_assistance/74.13_child_welfare_services.html">74.13.031</a>. Here is the <a href="rcw/74_public_assistance/74.13_child_welfare_services.html">modified chapter</a> for context.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop, administer, supervise, and monitor a coordinated and comprehensive plan that establishes, aids, and strengthens services for the protection and care of runaway, dependent, or neglected children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within available resources, the department shall recruit an adequate number of prospective adoptive and foster homes, both regular and specialized, i.e. homes for children of ethnic minority, including Indian homes for Indian children, sibling groups, children with disabilities or behavioral health conditions, teens, pregnant and parenting teens, and the department shall annually report to the governor and the legislature concerning the department's success in: (a) Meeting the need for adoptive and foster home placements; (b) reducing the foster parent turnover rate; (c) completing home studies for legally free children; and (d) implementing and operating the passport program required by RCW 74.13.285. The report shall include a section entitled &quot;Foster Home Turn-Over, Causes and Recommendations.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall investigate complaints of any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker that results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, or sexual abuse or exploitation, or that presents an imminent risk of serious harm, and on the basis of the findings of such investigation, offer child welfare services in relation to the problem to such parents, legal custodians, or persons serving in loco parentis, and/or bring the situation to the attention of an appropriate court, or another community agency. An investigation is not required of nonaccidental injuries which are clearly not the result of a lack of care or supervision by the child's parents, legal custodians, or persons serving in loco parentis. If the investigation reveals that a crime against a child may have been committed, the department shall notify the appropriate law enforcement agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As provided in RCW 26.44.030, the department may respond to a report of child abuse or neglect by using the family assessment response.</p>

<p>The department shall offer, on a voluntary basis, family reconciliation services to families who are in conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall monitor placements of children in out-of-home care and in-home dependencies to assure the safety, well-being, and quality of care being provided is within the scope of the intent of the legislature as defined in RCW 74.13.010 and 74.15.010. Under this section children in out-of-home care and in-home dependencies and their caregivers shall receive a private and individual face-to-face visit each month. The department shall randomly select no less than <strong>10</strong> percent of the caregivers currently providing care to receive one unannounced face‑to‑face visit in the caregiver's home per year. No caregiver will receive an unannounced visit through the random selection process for two consecutive years. If the caseworker makes a good faith effort to conduct the unannounced visit to a caregiver and is unable to do so, that month's visit to that caregiver need not be unannounced. The department is encouraged to group monthly visits to caregivers by geographic area so that in the event an unannounced visit cannot be completed, the caseworker may complete other required monthly visits. The department shall use a method of random selection that does not cause a fiscal impact to the department.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The department shall conduct the monthly visits with children and caregivers to whom it is providing child welfare services.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>The department shall have authority to accept custody of children from parents and to accept custody of children from juvenile courts, where authorized to do so under law, to provide child welfare services including placement for adoption, to provide for the routine and necessary medical, dental, and mental health care, or necessary emergency care of the children, and to provide for the physical care of such children and make payment of maintenance costs if needed**, including those required under section 1 of this act**. Except where required by Public Law 95-608 (25 U.S.C. Sec. 1915), no private adoption agency which receives children for adoption from the department shall discriminate on the basis of race, creed, or color when considering applications in their placement for adoption.</p>

A nonminor dependent whose dependency case was dismissed by the court may request extended foster care services before reaching age <strong>21</strong> years. Eligible nonminor dependents may unenroll and reenroll in extended foster care through a voluntary placement agreement an unlimited number of times between ages <strong>18</strong> and <strong>21</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall develop and implement rules regarding youth eligibility requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall make efforts to ensure that extended foster care services maximize medicaid reimbursements. This must include the department ensuring that health and mental health extended foster care providers participate in medicaid, unless the condition of the extended foster care youth requires specialty care that is not available among participating medicaid providers or there are no participating medicaid providers in the area. The department shall coordinate other services to maximize federal resources and the most cost-efficient delivery of services to extended foster care youth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall allow a youth who has received extended foster care services, but lost his or her eligibility, to reenter the extended foster care program an unlimited number of times through a voluntary placement agreement when he or she meets the eligibility criteria again.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall refer cases to the division of child support whenever state or federal funds are expended for the care and maintenance of a child, including a child with a developmental disability who is placed as a result of an action under chapter 13.34 RCW, unless the department finds that there is good cause not to pursue collection of child support against the parent or parents of the child. Cases involving individuals age <strong>18</strong> through <strong>20</strong> shall not be referred to the division of child support unless required by federal law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall have authority within funds appropriated for foster care services to purchase care for Indian children who are in the custody of a federally recognized Indian tribe or tribally licensed child-placing agency pursuant to parental consent, tribal court order, or state juvenile court order. The purchase of such care is exempt from the requirements of chapter 74.13B RCW and may be purchased from the federally recognized Indian tribe or tribally licensed child-placing agency, and shall be subject to the same eligibility standards and rates of support applicable to other children for whom the department purchases care.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of RCW 13.32A.170 through 13.32A.200, 43.185C.295, 74.13.035, and 74.13.036, or of this section all services to be provided by the department under subsections (4), (7), and (8) of this section, subject to the limitations of these subsections, may be provided by any program offering such services funded pursuant to Titles II and III of the federal juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act of 1974.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The department shall, within current funding levels, place on its public web site a document listing the duties and responsibilities the department has to a child subject to a dependency petition including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Reasonable efforts, including the provision of services, toward reunification of the child with his or her family;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sibling visits subject to the restrictions in RCW 13.34.136(2)(b)(ii);</p>

<p>The department shall have the authority to purchase legal representation for parents or kinship caregivers, or both, of children who are at risk of being dependent, or who are dependent, to establish or modify a parenting plan under RCW 13.34.155 or chapter 26.09, 26.26A, or 26.26B RCW or secure orders establishing other relevant civil legal relationships authorized by law, when it is necessary for the child's safety, permanence, or well-being. The department's purchase of legal representation for kinship caregivers must be within the department's appropriations. This subsection does not create an entitlement to legal representation purchased by the department and does not create judicial authority to order the department to purchase legal representation for a parent or kinship caregiver. Such determinations are solely within the department's discretion. The term &quot;kinship caregiver&quot; as used in this section means a caregiver who meets the definition of &quot;kin&quot; in RCW 74.13.600(1), unless the child is an Indian child as defined in RCW 13.38.040 and 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1903. For an Indian child as defined in RCW 13.38.040 and 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1903, the term &quot;kinship caregiver&quot; as used in this section means a caregiver who is an &quot;extended family member&quot; as defined in RCW 13.38.040(8).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department is encouraged to work with the office of public defense parent representation program and the office of civil legal aid to develop a cost-effective system for providing effective civil legal representation for parents and kinship caregivers if it exercises its authority under this subsection.</p>
