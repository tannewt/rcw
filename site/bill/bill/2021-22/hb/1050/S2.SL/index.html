<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that hydrofluorocarbons are air pollutants that pose significant threats to our environment. Although hydrofluorocarbons currently represent a small proportion of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, emissions of hydrofluorocarbons have been rapidly increasing in the United States and worldwide, and they are hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. In 2019, the legislature took a significant step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from hydrofluorocarbons by transitioning to the use of less damaging hydrofluorocarbons or suitable substitutes in certain new foam, aerosol, and refrigerant uses. However, significant sources of hydrofluorocarbon emissions in Washington remain unaddressed by the 2019 legislation, including legacy uses of hydrofluorocarbons as a refrigerant in infrastructure that was installed prior to the effective dates of the restrictions in the 2019 law, and from sources like stationary air conditioners and heat pumps that were not covered by the 2019 law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to reduce hydrofluorocarbon emissions, including by:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Authorizing the establishment of a maximum global warming potential threshold for hydrofluorocarbons used as a refrigerant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorizing the regulation of hydrofluorocarbons in air conditioning and heat pumps;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying the same basic emission control requirements to hydrofluorocarbons that have long applied to ozone-depleting substances used as refrigerants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a program to reduce leaks and encourage refrigerant recovery from large refrigeration and air conditioning systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directing the state building code council to adopt codes that are consistent with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with hydrofluorocarbons;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a state procurement preference for recycled refrigerants; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing consideration of the global warming potential of refrigerants used in equipment incentivized under utility conservation programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature that the ice rink used by Seattle's newest hockey franchise, the Seattle Kraken, should be as cold as possible, but also should be refrigerated using climate-friendly refrigerants, so that on opening night of the 2021-2022 National Hockey League season, as many fans as possible can simultaneously yell the Pacific Northwest's favorite new phrase: 'Release the Kraken!'</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A process for wholesalers, distributors, reclaimers, and refrigeration and air conditioning equipment operators to apply to the department for an exemption from some or all of the requirements of this section. Exemptions may be granted by the department on the basis of economic hardship, natural disaster, or after considering a calculation of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the granting of an exemption that will allow an identified leak to go unrepaired for a finite period of time.</p>

<p>The department may determine, assess, and collect annual fees from the owners or operators of refrigeration and air conditioning systems regulated under this section in an amount sufficient to cover the direct and indirect costs of administering and enforcing the provisions of this section. All fees collected under this subsection must be deposited in the refrigerant emission management account created in section 12 of this act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 1, 2029, and every five years thereafter, the department must consider the greenhouse gas emissions reductions achieved under the program created in this section and the criteria of section 11(3) of this act, and make a determination whether to continue to implement the program for the following five years. The department must notify the appropriate committees of the house of representatives and the senate of its determination.</p>

    i. Beginning January 1, 2016, only a qualifying utility that owns or is directly interconnected to a qualified biomass energy facility may use qualified biomass energy to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection.

    ii. A qualifying utility may no longer use electricity and associated renewable energy credits from a qualified biomass energy facility if the associated industrial pulping or wood manufacturing facility ceases operation other than for purposes of maintenance or upgrade.

k. An industrial facility that hosts a qualified biomass energy facility may only transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy generated at its facility to the qualifying utility with which it is directly interconnected with facilities owned by such a qualifying utility and that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage. The qualifying utility may only use an amount of renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy that are equivalent to the proportionate amount of its annual targets under (a)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection that was created by the load of the industrial facility. A qualifying utility that owns a qualified biomass energy facility may not transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy to another person, entity, or qualifying utility.

l. Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying utility may use eligible renewable resources as identified under RCW 19.285.030(12) (g) and (h) to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection (2). A qualifying utility may not transfer or sell these eligible renewable resources to another utility for compliance purposes under this chapter.

m.
