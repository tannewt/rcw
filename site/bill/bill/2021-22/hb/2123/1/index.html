<h2 id="section-1">Section 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Due to advancements in research and development in the cannabis industry nationwide, the legislature finds there is a need to provide consumers legal access to products that have been tested and which meet standards for quality and safety, while preventing intoxicating products from being sold outside of the regulated adult use marketplace, such as delta-8 THC, THC-O, and HHC. The legislature further finds that a comprehensive scientific review of cannabinoid science is needed to inform the legislature as to the appropriate statutory framework for the regulated industry.</p>
