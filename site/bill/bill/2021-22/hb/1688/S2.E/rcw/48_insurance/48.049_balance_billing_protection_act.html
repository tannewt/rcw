<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Consumers receive surprise bills or balance bills for services provided at <strong>nonparticipating</strong> facilities or by <strong>nonparticipating</strong> health care providers at in-network facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumers must not be placed in the middle of contractual disputes between providers and health insurance carriers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilities, providers, and health insurance carriers all share responsibility to ensure consumers have transparent information on network providers and benefit coverage, and the insurance commissioner is responsible for ensuring that provider networks include sufficient numbers and types of contracted providers to reasonably ensure consumers have in-network access for covered benefits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the intent of the legislature to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Ban balance billing of consumers enrolled in fully insured, regulated insurance plans and plans offered to public employees under chapter 41.05 RCW for the services described in RCW 48.49.020, and to provide self-funded group health plans with an option to elect to be subject to the provisions of <strong>this</strong> chapter ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove consumers from balance billing disputes and require that <strong>nonparticipating</strong> providers and carriers negotiate <strong>nonparticipating provider</strong> payments in good faith under the terms of <strong>this</strong> chapter ;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Align Washington state law with the federal balance billing prohibitions and transparency protections in sections 2799A-1 et seq. of the public health service act (P.L. 116-260) and implementing federal regulations in effect on the effective date of this section, while maintaining provisions of this chapter that provide greater protection for consumers; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an environment that encourages self-funded groups to negotiate  payments in good faith with <strong>nonparticipating</strong> providers and facilities in return for balance billing protections.</p>

<p>The enrollee satisfies his or her obligation to pay for the health care services if he or she pays the in-network cost-sharing amount specified in the enrollee's or applicable group's health plan contract.

To initiate arbitration, the carrier or <strong>nonparticipating provider, facility, or behavioral health emergency services provider</strong> must provide written notification to the commissioner and the noninitiating party no later than ten calendar days following completion of the period of good faith negotiation under RCW 48.49.030.

</li>
<li>
<p>Within seven calendar days of receipt of notification from the initiating party, the commissioner must provide the parties with a list of approved arbitrators or entities that provide arbitration. The arbitrators on the list must be trained by the American arbitration association or the American health lawyers association and <strong>must</strong> have experience in matters related to medical or health care services. The parties may agree on an arbitrator from the list provided by the commissioner. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator, they must notify the commissioner who must provide them with the names of five arbitrators from the list. Each party may veto two of the five named arbitrators. If one arbitrator remains, that person is the chosen arbitrator. If more than one arbitrator remains, the commissioner must choose the arbitrator from the remaining arbitrators. The parties and the commissioner must complete this selection process within twenty calendar days of receipt of the original list from the commissioner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each party must make written submissions to the arbitrator in support of its position no later than thirty calendar days after the final selection of the arbitrator. <strong>Each</strong> party must include in <strong>their</strong> written submission the evidence and methodology for asserting that the amount proposed to be paid is or is not commercially reasonable. A party that fails to make timely written submissions under this section without good cause shown shall be considered to be in default and the arbitrator shall require the party in default to pay the final offer amount submitted by the party not in default and may require the party in default to pay expenses incurred to date in the course of arbitration, including the arbitrator's expenses and fees and the reasonable attorneys' fees of the party not in default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the parties agree on an out-of-network rate for the services at issue after providing the arbitration initiation notice to the commissioner but before the arbitrator has made their decision, the amount agreed to by the parties for the service will be treated as the out-of-network rate for the service.

</li>
<li>
<p>In reviewing the submissions of the parties and making a decision related to whether payment should be made at the final offer amount of the initiating party or the noninitiating party, the arbitrator must consider the following factors:</p>

<li>
<p>The arbitrator may also consider other information that a party believes is relevant to the factors included in (b) of this subsection or other factors the arbitrator requests and information provided by the parties that is relevant to such request, including the Washington state all-payer claims database data set developed under RCW 43.371.100.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Expenses incurred in the course of arbitration, including the arbitrator's expenses and fees, but not including attorneys' fees, must be divided equally among the parties to the arbitration. <strong>The commissioner may establish allowable arbitrator fee ranges or an arbitrator fee schedule by rule. Arbitrator fees must be paid to the arbitrator by a party within 30 calendar days following receipt of the arbitrator's decision by the party.</strong> The enrollee is not liable for any of the costs of the arbitration and may not be required to participate in the arbitration proceeding as a witness or otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within <strong>10</strong> business days of a party notifying the commissioner and the noninitiating party of intent to initiate arbitration, both parties shall agree to and execute a nondisclosure agreement. The nondisclosure agreement must not preclude the arbitrator from submitting the arbitrator's decision to the commissioner under subsection (6) of this section or impede the commissioner's duty to prepare the annual report under RCW 48.49.050.</p>

<p><strong>The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding on the parties to the arbitration and is not subject to judicial review.</strong></p>
