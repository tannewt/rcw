<p>In addition to other powers authorized in Title 54 RCW, public utility districts may annex territory as provided in this section.</p>
<p>The boundaries of a public utility district may be enlarged and new contiguous territory added pursuant to the procedures for annexation by cities and towns provided in RCW 35.13.015 through 35.13.110. The provisions of these sections concerning community municipal corporations, review boards, and comprehensive plans, however, do not apply to public utility district annexations. For purposes of conforming with such procedures, the public utility district is deemed to be the city or town and the board of commissioners is deemed to be the city or town legislative body.</p>
<p>Annexation procedures provided in this section may only be used to annex territory that is both: (1) Contiguous to the annexing public utility district; and (2) located within the service area of the annexing public utility district. As used in this section, a public utility district's &quot;service area&quot; means those areas whether located within or outside of the annexing public utility district's boundaries that were generally served with electrical energy by the annexing public utility district on January 1, 1987. Such service area may, or may not, have been recognized in an agreement made under chapter 54.48 RCW, but no area may be included within such service area that was generally served with electrical energy on January 1, 1987, by another public utility as defined in RCW 54.48.010. An area proposed to be annexed may be located in the same or a different county as the annexing public utility district.</p>
<p>If an area proposed to be annexed is located within the boundaries of another public utility district, annexation may be initiated only upon petition of registered voters residing in the area in accordance with RCW 35.13.020 and adoption by the boards of commissioners of both districts of identical resolutions stating (a) the boundaries of the area to be annexed, (b) a determination that annexation is in the public interest of the residents of the area to be annexed as well as the public interest of their respective districts, (c) approval of annexation by the board, (d) the boundaries of the districts after annexation, (e) the disposition of any assets of the districts in the area to be annexed, (f) the obligations to be assumed by the annexing district, (g) apportionment of election costs, and (h) that voters in the area to be annexed will be advised of lawsuits that may impose liability on the annexed territory and the possible impact of annexation on taxes and utility rates.</p>
<p>If annexation is approved, the area annexed shall cease to be a part of the one public utility district at the same time that it becomes a part of the other district. The annexing public utility district shall assume responsibility for providing the area annexed with the services provided by the other public utility district in the area annexed.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Unless otherwise provided in an agreement between the public utility district and the city or town, taxes or assessments levied or assessed against property located in an area withdrawn from a public utility district shall remain a lien and be collected as by law (a) if the taxes or assessments were levied or assessed before the withdrawal or (b) if the levies or assessments were made to pay or secure an obligation of the district duly incurred or issued before the withdrawal. The withdrawal of an area from the boundaries of a district does not exempt any property therein from taxation or assessment for the purpose of paying the costs of retiring or redeeming any obligation of the district duly incurred or issued before the withdrawal.</p>

<li>
<p>As used in this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>&quot;Attachment&quot; means the affixation or installation of any wire, cable, or other physical material capable of carrying electronic impulses or light waves for the carrying of intelligence for telecommunications or television, including, but not limited to cable, and any related device, apparatus, or auxiliary equipment upon any pole owned or controlled in whole or in part by one or more locally regulated utilities where the installation has been made with the necessary consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Licensee&quot; means any person, firm, corporation, partnership, company, association, joint stock association, or cooperatively organized association, which is authorized to construct attachments upon, along, under, or across public ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Locally regulated utility&quot; means a public utility district not subject to rate or service regulation by the utilities and transportation commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Nondiscriminatory&quot; means that pole owners may not arbitrarily differentiate among or between similar classes of licensees approved for attachments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>All rates, terms, and conditions made, demanded, or received by a locally regulated utility for attachments to its poles must be just, reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and sufficient. A locally regulated utility shall levy attachment space rental rates that are uniform for the same class of service within the locally regulated utility service area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A just and reasonable rate must be calculated as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>One component of the rate shall consist of the additional costs of procuring and maintaining pole attachments, but may not exceed the actual capital and operating expenses of the locally regulated utility attributable to that portion of the pole, duct, or conduit used for the pole attachment, including a share of the required support and clearance space, in proportion to the space used for the pole attachment, as compared to all other uses made of the subject facilities and uses that remain available to the owner or owners of the subject facilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other component of the rate shall consist of the additional costs of procuring and maintaining pole attachments, but may not exceed the actual capital and operating expenses of the locally regulated utility attributable to the share, expressed in feet, of the required support and clearance space, divided equally among the locally regulated utility and all attaching licensees, in addition to the space used for the pole attachment, which sum is divided by the height of the pole; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The just and reasonable rate shall be computed by adding one-half of the rate component resulting from (a) of this subsection to one-half of the rate component resulting from (b) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purpose of establishing a rate under subsection (3)(a) of this section, the locally regulated utility may establish a rate according to the calculation set forth in subsection (3)(a) of this section or it may establish a rate according to the cable formula set forth by the federal communications commission by rule as it existed on June 12, 2008, or such subsequent date as may be provided by the federal communications commission by rule, consistent with the purposes of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except in extraordinary circumstances, a locally regulated utility must respond to a licensee's application to enter into a new pole attachment contract or renew an existing pole attachment contract within forty-five days of receipt, stating either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The application is complete; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application is incomplete, including a statement of what information is needed to make the application complete.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within sixty days of an application being deemed complete, the locally regulated utility shall notify the applicant as to whether the application has been accepted for licensing or rejected. In extraordinary circumstances, and with the approval of the applicant, the locally regulated utility may extend the sixty-day timeline under this subsection. If the application is rejected, the locally regulated utility must provide reasons for the rejection. A request to attach may only be denied on a nondiscriminatory basis (a) where there is insufficient capacity; or (b) for reasons of safety, reliability, or the inability to meet generally applicable engineering standards and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed or is intended to confer upon the utilities and transportation commission any authority to exercise jurisdiction over locally regulated utilities.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to chapter 48.62 RCW, any public utility district engaged in the operation of electric or water utilities may enter into contracts of group insurance for the benefit of its employees, and pay all or any part of the premiums for such insurance. Such premiums shall be paid out of the revenues derived from the operation of such properties: PROVIDED, That if the premium is to be paid by the district and employees jointly, and the benefits of the policy are offered to all eligible employees, not less than seventy-five percent of such employees may be so insured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public utility district engaged in the operation of electric or water utilities may establish and maintain for the benefit of its eligible employees and officials any plan of deferred compensation or supplemental savings plan for retirement, and make contributions or pay benefits thereunder out of the revenue derived from the operation of its properties. For purposes of this section, &quot;contributions&quot; includes contributions on behalf of an eligible employee equal to the amount by which the employee agrees to a reduction in salary or wages and also includes contributions made by the public utility district separate from amounts otherwise intended as salary or wages. Coverage of an employee under a plan under this section does not render the employee or official ineligible for simultaneous membership and participation in any pension system for public employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributions must be deposited in designated accounts, held in trust, or remitted to an insurer. When deposited to an account or held in trust, the account or trust fund is considered a public retirement fund within the meaning of Article XXIX, section 1 of the state Constitution, for the purpose of determining eligible investments and deposits of money into the account or trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributions may be deposited or invested in a credit union, savings and loan association, bank, mutual savings bank, purchase life insurance, shares of an investment company, or fixed or variable annuity contracts from any insurance company or any investment company licensed to contract business in this state. To the extent a plan is an individual account plan, participants in the plan may be permitted to self-direct the investment of assets allocated to their account through the selection of investment options authorized under the plan, and an employee, official, or commissioner of the district is not liable for any loss or deficiency resulting from participant investments. An &quot;individual account plan&quot; is a plan that provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based upon the amount contributed to the participant's account, and any income, expenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts or other participants which may be allocated to that participant's account.</p>

Every such person who was covered at the time of acquisition by a plan with the private utility shall have added and accredited to his or her period of employment his or her period of immediately preceding continuous service with such private utility if he or she remains in the service of the municipal corporation until such plan for which he or she seeks admission becomes applicable to him or her.</p>
<p>No such person shall have added and accredited to his or her period of employment his or her period of service with said private utility unless he or she or a third party shall pay to the appropriate officer or fund of the plan to which he or she requests admission his or her contribution for the period of such service with the private utility at the rate provided in or for such plan to which he or she desires admission, or if he or she shall be entitled to any private benefits, as a result of such private service, unless he or she agrees at the time of his or her employment with the district to accept a reduction in the payment of any benefits payable under the plan to which he or she requests entry that are based in whole or in part on such added and accredited service by the amount of benefits received. For the purposes of contributions, the date of entry of service shall be deemed the date of entry into service with the private utility, which service is accredited by this section, and the amount of contributions for the period of accredited service shall be based on the wages or salary of such person during that added and accredited period of service with the private utility.</p>
<p>The district may receive such payments from a third party and shall make from such payments contributions with respect to such prior service as may be necessary to enable it to assume its obligations.</p>
<p>After such contributions have been made and such service added and accredited such employee shall be established in the plan to which he or she seeks admission with all rights, benefits, and privileges that he or she would have been entitled to had he or she been a member of the plan from the beginning of his or her immediately preceding continuous employment with the private utility or of his or her eligibility.</p>
