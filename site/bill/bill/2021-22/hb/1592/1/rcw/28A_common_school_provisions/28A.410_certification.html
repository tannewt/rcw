<p>The Washington professional educator standards board shall establish, publish, and enforce rules determining eligibility for and certification of personnel employed in the common schools of this state, including certification for emergency or temporary, substitute or provisional duty and under such certificates or permits as the board shall deem proper or as otherwise prescribed by law. The rules shall require that the initial application for certification shall require, at the applicant's expense, a criminal history record check of the applicant through the Washington state patrol criminal identification system under RCW 43.43.830 through 43.43.834, 10.97.030, and 10.97.050 and through the federal bureau of investigation. The record check shall include a fingerprint check using a complete Washington state criminal identification fingerprint card. An individual who holds a valid portable background check clearance card issued by the department of children, youth, and families consistent with RCW 43.216.270 is exempt from the office of the superintendent of public instruction fingerprint background check if the individual provides a true and accurate copy of his or her Washington state patrol and federal bureau of investigation background report results to the office of the superintendent of public instruction. The superintendent of public instruction may waive the record check for any applicant who has had a record check within the two years before application. The superintendent of public instruction shall use the fingerprint criminal history record check information solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for a certificate under this section. The rules shall permit a holder of a lapsed certificate but not a revoked or suspended certificate to be employed on a conditional basis by a school district with the requirement that the holder must complete any certificate renewal requirements established by the state board of education within two years of initial reemployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In establishing rules pertaining to the qualifications of instructors of American sign language the board shall consult with the national association of the deaf, &quot;sign instructors guidance network&quot; (s.i.g.n.), and the Washington state association of the deaf for evaluation and certification of sign language instructors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board shall develop rules consistent with RCW 18.340.020 for the certification of spouses of military personnel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction shall act as the administrator of any such rules and have the power to issue any certificates or permits and revoke the same in accordance with board rules.</p>

<p>A school psychologist is a professional educator who holds a valid school psychologist certification as defined by the professional educator standards board. Pursuant to the national association of school psychologists' model for comprehensive and integrated school psychological services, school psychologists deliver services across ten domains of practice. Two domains permeate all areas of service delivery: Data-based decision making; and consultation and collaboration. Five domains encompass direct and indirect services to children and their families: Student-level services, interventions, and instructional supports to develop academic skills; student-level interventions and mental health services to develop social and life skills; systems-level school-wide practices to promote learning; systems-level preventive and responsive services; and systems-level family school collaboration services. The three foundational domains include: Knowledge and skills related to diversity in development and learning; research and program evaluation; and legal and ethical practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A school social worker is a professional in the fields of social work and education who holds a valid school social worker certification as defined by the professional educator standards board. The purpose and role of the school social worker is to provide an integral link between school, home, and community in helping students achieve academic and social success. This is accomplished by removing barriers and providing services that include: Mental health and academic counseling, support for students and parents, crisis prevention and intervention, professional case management, collaboration with other professionals, organizations, and community agencies, and advocacy for students and parents. School social workers work directly with school administrators as well as students and families, at various levels and as part of an interdisciplinary team in the educational system, including at the building, district, and state level. School social workers provide leadership and professional expertise regarding the formation of school discipline policies and procedures, and through school-based mental health services, crisis management, the implementation of social-emotional learning, and other support services that impact student academic and social-emotional success. School social workers also facilitate community involvement in the schools while advocating for student success.</p>

<p>The legislature finds that the current economic environment requires that the state, when appropriate, charge for some of the services provided directly to the users of those services. The office of the superintendent of public instruction is currently supported with state funds to process certification fees. In addition, the legislature finds that the processing of certifications should be moved to an online system that allows educators to manage their certifications and provides better information to policymakers. The legislature intends to assess a certification processing fee to eliminate state-funded support of the cost to issue educator certificates.</p>

<p>In addition to the certification fee established under RCW 28A.410.060 for certificated instructional staff as defined in RCW 28A.150.203, the superintendent of public instruction shall charge an application processing fee for initial educator certificates and subsequent actions, and paraeducator certificates and subsequent actions. The superintendent of public instruction shall establish the amount of the fee by rule under chapter 34.05 RCW. The superintendent shall set the fee at a sufficient level to defray the costs of administering the educator certification program under RCW 28A.300.040(9) and the paraeducator certificate program under chapter 28A.413 RCW. Revenue generated through the processing fee shall be deposited in the educator certification processing account.</p>

Moneys in the account may be spent only for the processing of educator certificates and subsequent actions and paraeducator certificates and subsequent actions. Disbursements from the account shall be on authorization of the superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent's designee.

<li>
<p>The superintendent of public instruction may initiate and conduct investigations as may be reasonably necessary to establish the existence of any alleged violations of or noncompliance with this chapter or any rules adopted under it. For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this chapter, the superintendent or any officer designated by the superintendent may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records that the superintendent deems relevant and material to the inquiry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigations conducted by the superintendent of public instruction concerning alleged sexual misconduct towards a child shall be completed within one year of the initiation of the investigation or within thirty days of the completion of all proceedings, including court proceedings, resulting from an investigation conducted by law enforcement or child protective services if there is such an investigation. The superintendent of public instruction may take, for reasonable cause, additional time for completion of the investigation after informing the victim, the individual being investigated, and the school district that employs the individual being investigated of the reasons additional time is needed and the amount of additional time needed. Written notification must be provided to each of the parties who must be informed. The sole remedy for a failure to complete an investigation of sexual misconduct within the time allowed by this subsection is a civil penalty of fifty dollars per day for each day beyond the allowed time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any person fails to obey a subpoena or obeys a subpoena but refuses to give evidence, any court of competent jurisdiction, upon application by the superintendent, may issue to that person an order requiring him or her to appear before the court and to show cause why he or she should not be compelled to obey the subpoena, and give evidence material to the matter under investigation. The failure to obey an order of the court may be punishable as contempt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once an investigation has been initiated by the superintendent of public instruction, the investigation shall be completed regardless of whether the individual being investigated has resigned his or her position or allowed his or her teaching certificate to lapse. The superintendent shall make a written finding regarding each investigation indicating the actions taken, including a statement of the reasons why a complaint was dismissed or did not warrant further investigation or action by the superintendent, and shall provide such notice to each person who filed the complaint. Written findings under this section are subject to public disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An investigation into sexual or physical abuse of a student by a school employee shall only be initiated by the superintendent of public instruction after the superintendent of public instruction verifies that the incident has been reported to the proper law enforcement agency or the department of social and health services as required under RCW 26.44.030.</p>
