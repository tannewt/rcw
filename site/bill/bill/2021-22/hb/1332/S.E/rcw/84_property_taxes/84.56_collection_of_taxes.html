<p>The interest and penalties for delinquencies on property taxes must be waived by the county treasurer if the notice for these taxes due, as provided in RCW 84.56.050, was not sent to a taxpayer due to error by the county. Where waiver of interest and penalties has occurred, the full amount of interest and penalties must be reinstated if the taxpayer fails to pay the delinquent taxes within thirty days of receiving notice that the taxes are due. Each county treasurer must, subject to guidelines prepared by the department of revenue, establish administrative procedures to determine if taxpayers are eligible for this waiver.</p>

<p>In addition to the waiver under subsection (1) of this section, the interest and penalties for delinquencies on property taxes must be waived by the county treasurer under the following circumstances:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the waivers under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the county treasurer, at his or her discretion, may waive interest and penalties for delinquencies on property taxes where the taxpayer paid an erroneous amount due to apparent taxpayer error and the taxpayer pays the delinquent taxes within thirty days of receiving notice that the taxes are due.</p>

<p>Before allowing a hardship waiver under subsection (2) of this section, the county treasurer may require a copy of the death certificate along with an affidavit signed by the taxpayer.</p>

Traveling fees must be computed from the county seat of the county to the place of making distraint.</p>
</li>

The notice must describe the property, give the name of the owner or reputed owner, the amount of the tax due, with interest, and the time and place of sale. A copy of the notice must also be sent to the owner or reputed owner at his or her last known address, by registered letter at least thirty days prior to the date of sale.</p>

<li>
<p>If the county treasurer has reasonable grounds to believe that any personal property, including mobile homes, manufactured homes, or park model trailers, upon which taxes have been levied, but not paid, is about to be removed from the county where the property has been assessed, or is about to be destroyed, sold, or disposed of, the county treasurer may demand the taxes, without the notice provided for in this section, and if necessary distrain sufficient goods and chattels to pay the same.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The county treasurer must waive outstanding interest and penalties on delinquent taxes due from the title owner of a mobile or manufactured home if the property is subject to an action for distraint under this section and the following requirements are met:</p>

<li>
<p>The title owner is income-qualified under RCW 84.36.381(5)(a), as verified by the county assessor;</p>

<p>The title owner or agent is paying the delinquent base taxes owed on the year or years that the outstanding interest and penalties are being waived and submits a complete application at least fourteen days prior to recording of distraint documents; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The title owner has not previously received a waiver on the property as provided under this section.</p>
</li>

<p>Whenever in the judgment of the assessor or the county treasurer personal property is being removed or is about to be removed from the state, or is being dissipated or about to be dissipated, or is being or about to be sold, disposed of, or removed from the county so as to jeopardize collection of taxes, the treasurer must immediately prepare papers in distraint. The papers must contain a description of the personal property, including mobile homes, manufactured homes, or park model trailers, being or about to be removed, dissipated, sold, disposed of, or removed from the county so as to jeopardize collection of taxes, the amount of the tax, the amount of accrued interest at the rate provided by law from the date of delinquency, and the name of the owner or reputed owner. The treasurer must, without demand or notice, distrain sufficient goods and chattels belonging to the person charged with the taxes to pay the taxes with interest at the rate provided by law from the date of delinquency, together with all accruing costs. The treasurer must advertise and sell the property as provided in RCW 84.56.070 or subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the personal property is being removed or is about to be removed from the state, is being dissipated or about to be dissipated, or is being or about to be sold, disposed of, or removed from the county so as to jeopardize collection of taxes, at any time subsequent to the first day of January in any year, and prior to the levy of taxes thereon, the taxes upon the property so distrained must be computed upon the rate of levy for state, county, and local purposes for the preceding year. All taxes collected in advance of levy under this section and RCW 84.56.120, together with the name of the owner and a brief description of the property assessed, must be entered forthwith by the county treasurer upon the personal property tax rolls of such preceding year, and all collections thereon must be considered and treated in all respects, and without recourse by either the owner or any taxing unit, as collections for such preceding year. Property on which taxes are thus collected are discharged from the lien of any taxes that may thereafter be levied in the year in which payment or collection is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever property has been removed from the county wherein it has been assessed, on which the taxes have not been paid, then the county treasurer, or the treasurer's deputy, has the same power to distrain and sell the property for the satisfaction of the taxes as he or she would have if the property were situated in the county in which the property was taxed. In addition, the treasurer, or the treasurer's deputy, in the distraint and sale of property for the payment of taxes, has the same powers as the sheriff in making levy and sale of property on execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an alternative to the sale procedure specified in RCW 84.56.070, the county treasurer may conduct a public auction sale by electronic media pursuant to RCW 36.16.145.</p>
