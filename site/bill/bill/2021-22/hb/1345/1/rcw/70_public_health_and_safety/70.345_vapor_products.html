<li>
<p>The licenses issuable by the board under this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A vapor product retailer's license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vapor product distributor's license;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A vapor product manufacturer's license; and</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A vapor product delivery sale license.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application for the licenses must be made through the business licensing system under chapter 19.02 RCW. The board may adopt rules regarding the regulation of the licenses <strong>and licensees</strong>. The board may refuse to issue any license under this chapter if the board has reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has willfully withheld information requested for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the applicant to receive a license, or if the board has reasonable cause to believe that information submitted in the application is false or misleading or is not made in good faith. In addition, for the purpose of reviewing an application for a <strong>manufacturer's license,</strong> distributor's license, retailer's license, or delivery seller's license, and for considering the denial, suspension, or revocation of any such license, the board may consider criminal conduct of the applicant, including an administrative violation history record with the board and a criminal history record information check within the previous five years, in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions, and the provisions of RCW 9.95.240 and chapter 9.96A RCW do not apply to such cases. The board may, in its discretion, issue or refuse to issue <strong>a manufacturer's license,</strong> retailer's license, distributor's license, <strong>or</strong> delivery sale license subject to the provisions of RCW 70.155.100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application processes for the retailer license and the distributor license, and any forms used for such processes, must allow the applicant to simultaneously apply for a delivery sale license without requiring the applicant to undergo a separate licensing application process in order to be licensed to conduct delivery sales. However, a delivery sale license obtained in conjunction with a retailer or distributor license under this subsection remains a separate license subject to the delivery sale licensing fee established under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person may qualify for a <strong>manufacturer's license,</strong> retailer's license, distributor's license, or delivery sale license under this section without first undergoing a criminal background check. The background check must be performed by the board and must disclose any criminal conduct within the previous five years in any state, tribal, or federal jurisdiction in the United States, its territories, or possessions. If the applicant or licensee also has a license issued under chapter 66.24, 69.50, 82.24, or 82.26 RCW, the background check done under the authority of chapter 66.24, 69.50, 82.24, or 82.26 RCW satisfies the requirements of this subsection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each license issued under this chapter expires on the business license expiration date. The license must be continued annually if the licensee has paid the required fee and complied with all the provisions of this chapter and the rules of the board adopted pursuant to this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each license and any other evidence of the license required under this chapter must be exhibited in each place of business for which it is issued and in the manner required for the display of a business license.</p>
