<li>
<p>If an entire tract or parcel of land is sold by the acre, it shall not be measured but shall be deemed and taken to contain the number of acres named in the description, and be paid for accordingly; and if the number of acres is not contained in the description, the officer shall declare according to his or her judgment how many acres are contained therein, which shall be deemed and taken to be the true number of acres.</p>

<p>If objections to confirmation are filed, the court shall nevertheless allow the order confirming the sale, unless on the hearing of the motion, it shall satisfactorily appear that there were substantial irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale, to the probable loss or injury of the party objecting. In the latter case, the court shall disallow the motion and direct that the property be resold, in whole or in part, as the case may be, as upon an execution received as of that date.</p>

<p>Upon a resale, the bid of the purchaser at the former sale shall be deemed to be renewed and continue in force, and no bid shall be taken, except for a greater amount. If on resale the property sells for a greater amount to any person other than the former purchaser, the clerk shall first repay to the former purchaser out of the proceeds of the resale the amount of the former purchaser's bid together with interest as is provided in the judgment.</p>

<p>If, after confirmation of the sale and the judgment is satisfied, there are any proceeds of the sale remaining, the clerk shall pay such proceeds, as provided for in (b) of this subsection, to all interests in, or liens against, the property eliminated by sale under this section in the order of priority that the interest, lien, or claim attached to the property, as determined by the court. Any remaining proceeds shall be paid to the judgment debtor, or the judgment debtor's representative, as the case may be, before the order is made upon the motion to confirm the sale only if the party files with the clerk a waiver of all objections made or to be made to the proceedings concerning the sale; otherwise, the excess proceeds shall remain in the custody of the clerk until the sale of the property has been disposed of.</p>

<p>Anyone seeking disbursement of surplus funds shall file a motion requesting disbursement in the superior court for the county in which the surplus funds are deposited. Notice of the motion shall be served upon or mailed to all persons who had an interest in the property at the time of sale, and any other party who has entered an appearance in the proceeding, not less than twenty days prior to the hearing of the motion. The clerk shall not disburse such remaining proceeds except upon order of the superior court of such county.</p>

<p>In all cases where real estate has been, or may hereafter be sold by virtue of an execution or other process, it shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer making such sale to execute and deliver to the purchaser, or other person entitled to the same, a deed of conveyance of the real estate so sold. The deeds shall be issued upon request immediately after the confirmation of sale by the court in those instances where redemption rights have been precluded pursuant to RCW 61.12.093 et seq., or immediately after the time for redemption from such sale has expired in those instances in which there are redemption rights, as provided in RCW 6.23.060. In case the term of office of the sheriff or other officer making such sale shall have expired before a sufficient deed has been executed, then the successor in office of such sheriff shall, within the time specified in this section, execute and deliver to the purchaser or other person entitled to the same a deed of the premises so sold, and such deeds shall be as valid and effectual to convey to the grantee the lands or premises so sold, as if the deed had been made by the sheriff or other officer who made the sale.</p>
