## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the agricultural industry is a significant part of the culture and economy of Washington. Even so, according to the 2017 census of agriculture prepared by the United States department of agriculture, farmers from historically underrepresented groups make up only a small fraction of total farmers. For example, less than 2,000 producers out of 63,298 total, or about three percent, are from American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Black/African American, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities. Additionally, under 3,000 producers report to be of Latin, Hispanic, or Spanish origin.

2. The legislature further recognizes systemic barriers for historically underrepresented groups have kept these groups from accessing opportunities in agriculture. It is critical to provide opportunities to enter and remain in the agricultural industry to people who are underrepresented in agriculture.

3. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure opportunities for historically underrepresented groups to enter and remain in the farming industry. Further, it is the intent of the legislature to ensure that farmers and ranchers from historically underrepresented groups are aware of and have equitable access to federal and state resources available to help them thrive.
