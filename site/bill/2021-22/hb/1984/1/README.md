## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that printing addresses on vehicle registrations provides an opportunity for thieves that break into vehicles to use the information for nefarious purposes that can be avoided if the address is not printed on the vehicle registration certificate.

2. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies have access to databases that include the vehicle registrant's address so such information does not need to be printed on paper vehicle registration certificates.

3. In order to reduce criminal opportunities, the legislature directs the department of licensing to no longer print addresses on vehicle, trailer, and vessel registration certificates.
