## Section 1
Commercial motor vehicle parking shortages are a national safety concern. Washington state has exacerbated the problem in the fall of 2021 by the closure of many state-owned and operated safety rest areas. All vehicle drivers need safe places to stop when they are tired to prevent serious and fatal injuries. Washington's target zero plan reports that drowsy driving was a factor in 44 deaths and 236 serious injuries from 2015-2017. One of the ways Washington's target zero plan addresses this issue is having available rest areas. The closure of state-owned safety rest areas is contrary to state policy to have zero deaths on the roadways.

In addition, commercial truck drivers are required to take federally mandated rest breaks that leads to the need for there to be parking available in many locations throughout the highway system. Safety rest areas are important for supply line integrity and the use by the traveling public. The legislature believes it is essential for this public service to be restored and maintained in the future as quickly as possible.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [47.38](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.38_roadside_areas—safety_rest_areas.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.38_roadside_areas—safety_rest_areas.md) for context.

The department is directed to reconfigure its maintenance operations to assure that its owned and operated safety rest areas are open for use except for seasonal closures or cleaning, maintenance, and repairs. The change in structure may take advantage of the gig economy and restructure existing vacant employee positions to be more in line with current needs. The department may issue short-term contracts to provide cleaning, security, or repairs to the safety rest areas when the department is unable to provide such services using existing employees.
