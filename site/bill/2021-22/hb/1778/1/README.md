1. Prior to certification of the election as required by RCW 29A.60.190, the county auditor shall conduct an audit  using at minimum one of the following methods:

    a.

A risk-limiting audit. A "risk-limiting audit" means an audit protocol that makes use of statistical principles and methods and is designed to limit the risk of certifying an incorrect election outcome. The secretary of state shall:

        i. Set the risk limit. A "risk limit" means the largest statistical probability that an incorrect reported tabulation outcome is not detected in a risk-limiting audit;

        ii. Randomly select for audit at least one statewide contest, and for each county at least one ballot contest other than the selected statewide contest. The county auditor shall randomly select a ballot contest for audit if in any particular election there is no statewide contest; and

        iii. Establish procedures for implementation of risk-limiting audits, including random selection of the audit sample, determination of audit size, and procedures for a  ballot polling risk-limiting audit .

**A** ballot polling risk-limiting audit**means an audit in which individual paper ballots are randomly selected and the voter marking are examined and interpreted manually** until the prespecified risk limit is met; or

    b. **A manual audit of the manual count. The procedures must provide for best practices and uniform procedures across all counties. The manual audit process shall involve a comparison of a manual count of the selected number of ballots to the count from the original manual count of the returned ballots**.

2.

For each audit method, the secretary of state must adopt procedures for expanding the audit to include additional ballots when an audit results in a discrepancy. The procedure must specify under what circumstances a discrepancy will lead to an audit of additional ballots, and the method to determine how many additional ballots will be selected. The secretary of state shall adopt procedures to investigate the cause of any discrepancy found during an audit.

3. **The secretary of state may contract with an independent third-party vendor to conduct an audit under this section.**

4. The secretary of state must establish rules  to implement and administer the auditing methods in this section, including facilitating public observation and reporting requirements.
