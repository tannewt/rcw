## **35.95A.050 - Powers.**
Every authority has the following powers:

1. To acquire by purchase, condemnation, gift, or grant and to lease, construct, add to, improve, replace, repair, maintain, operate, and regulate the use of public **grade-separated** transportation facilities, including passenger terminal and parking facilities and properties, and other facilities and properties as may be necessary for passenger and vehicular access to and from public **grade-separated** transportation facilities, together with all lands, rights-of-way, and property within or outside the authority area, and together with equipment and accessories necessary or appropriate for these facilities, except that property, including but not limited to other types of public transportation facilities, that is owned by any city, county, county transportation authority, public transportation benefit area, metropolitan municipal corporation, or regional transit authority may be acquired or used by an authority only with the consent of the public entity owning the property. The entities are authorized to convey or lease property to an authority or to contract for their joint use on terms fixed by agreement between the entity and the authority;

2. To fix rates, tolls, fares, and charges for the use of facilities and to establish various routes and classes of service. Rates, tolls, fares, or charges may be adjusted or eliminated for any distinguishable class of users including, but not limited to, senior citizens and persons with disabilities;

3. To contract with the United States or any of its agencies, any state or any of its agencies, **any public transportation benefit district, county transportation authority, regional transit authority,** any metropolitan municipal corporation, and other country, city, other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality, or governmental agency, or any private person, firm, or corporation for **: (a) The** purpose of receiving any gifts or grants or securing loans or advances for preliminary planning and feasibility studies**; (b)** the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of public **grade-separated** transportation facilities

Before any contract is entered with any private person, firm, or corporation, competitive bids shall first be called upon such notice, bidder qualifications, and bid conditions as the board shall determine. This shall allow use of negotiated procurements. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of chapters 39.12 and 39.19 RCW apply to a contract entered into under this section as if the public transportation systems and facilities were owned by a public body regardless of the use of a negotiated procurement method**;

4. To contract with the United States or any of its agencies, any state or any of its agencies, any metropolitan municipal corporation, any other county, city, **regional transit authority,** other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality, any governmental agency, or any private person, firm, or corporation for the use by either contracting party of all or any part of the facilities, structures, lands, interests in lands, air rights over lands, and rights‑of‑way of all kinds which are owned, leased, or held by the other party **; or** for the purpose of planning, designing, constructing, operating any public transportation facility, or performing any service related to transportation which the authority is authorized to operate or perform, on terms as may be agreed upon by the contracting parties;

5. To acquire any existing public transportation facility by conveyance, sale, or lease. In any acquisition from a county, city, **regional transit authority,** or other political subdivision of the state, the authority will receive credit from the county or city or **regional transit authority or** other political subdivision for any federal assistance and state matching assistance used by the county or city **or regional transit authority** or other political subdivision in acquiring any portion of the public transportation facility. Upon acquisition, the authority must assume and observe all existing labor contracts relating to the public transportation facility and, to the extent necessary for operation of the public transportation facility, all of the employees of the public transportation facility whose duties are necessary to efficiently operate the public transportation facility must be appointed to comparable positions to those which they held at the time of the transfer, and no employee or retired or pensioned employee of the public transportation facility will be placed in any worse position with respect to pension seniority, wages, sick leave, vacation, or other benefits than he or she enjoyed as an employee of the public transportation facility prior to the acquisition. Furthermore, the authority must engage in collective bargaining with the duly appointed representatives of any employee labor organization having existing contracts with the acquired facility and may enter into labor contracts with the employee labor organization;

6. To  prepare, adopt, and carry out a comprehensive public **grade-separated system plan and financing** plan and to make other plans and studies and to perform programs as the authority deems necessary to implement and comply with those laws**. To the extent that new public grade-separated transportation corridors are planned, financing and system plans shall take into account (a) 30-year projected ridership, (b) the number of income-restricted affordable housing units within a 15-minute walking radius of stations, and (c) the number of transit-dependent households within a 15-minute walking radius of stations. On at least an annual basis throughout the planning process for each corridor, the authority shall consider and report the anticipated ridership, the number of income-restricted affordable housing units within a 15-minute walking radius of stations, and the number of transit-dependent households within a 15-minute walking radius of stations for each studied alternative within each corridor.

7. To establish local improvement districts within the authority area to finance public **grade-separated** transportation facilities, to levy special assessments on property specially benefited by those facilities, and to issue local improvement bonds to be repaid by the collection of local improvement assessments. The method of establishment, levying, collection, enforcement, and all other matters relating to the local improvement districts, assessments, collection, and bonds are as provided in the statutes governing local improvement districts of cities and towns. The duties devolving upon the city treasurer in those statutes are imposed on the treasurer of the authority;

8. To exercise all other powers necessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilities, including without limitation the power to sue and be sued, to own, construct, purchase, lease, add to, and maintain any real and personal property or property rights necessary for the conduct of the affairs of the authority, to enter into contracts, and to employ the persons as the authority deems appropriate. An authority may also sell, lease, convey, or otherwise dispose of any real or personal property no longer necessary for the conduct of the affairs of the authority**;**

9. **Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, to the extent new public grade-separated transportation facilities are to be constructed by the authority, or using the funds collected by the authority, the authority may construct new public grade-separated transportation facilities for operation in entirely exclusive rights-of-way without grade crossings. This subsection does not limit the authority from maintaining or improving existing facilities that may be transferred to the authority. Public grade-separated transportation facilities constructed by the authority, or using the funds collected by the authority, may be constructed at surface level elevation or in a retained cut. For the purposes of this subsection, "grade crossings" means a place where a mode of transportation other than public grade-separated transportation facilities crosses with public grade-separated transportation facilities at the same elevation or where the crossing of another mode of transportation may hinder the movement of train cars operating in public grade-separated transportation facilities;**

10. **To use the powers provided herein to construct public grade-separated transportation facilities to be designated as supplemental transportation improvements for purposes of RCW 35.21.925, by the city containing the authority area;**

This insurance may include any types of insurance covering, and for the benefit of, one or more parties with whom the authority contracts for any purpose, and insurance for the benefit of its board members, authority officers, and employees to insure against liability for acts or omissions while performing or in good faith purporting to perform their official duties. All insurance obtained for construction of authority projects with a total project cost exceeding $100,000,000 may be acquired by bid or by negotiation. In order to allow the authority flexibility to secure appropriate insurance by negotiation, the authority is exempt from RCW 48.30.270;**

16. **To dispose of any real or personal property acquired in connection with any authority function and that is no longer required for the purposes of the authority, in the same manner as provided for cities of the first class. When an authority determines that a facility or any part thereof that has been acquired from any public agency without compensation is no longer required for authority purposes, but is required by the agency from which it was acquired, the authority shall by resolution transfer it to such agency**.

## **35.95A.060 - Funds and accounts—Designation of treasurer.**
Each authority will establish necessary and appropriate funds and accounts consistent with the uniform system of accounts developed pursuant to RCW 43.09.210. The authority **shall** contract with any city with territory within the authority area for treasury and other financial functions. The city must be reimbursed for the expenses of treasury services.

An authority may additionally issue general obligation bonds, together with outstanding voter‑approved and nonvoter-approved general obligation indebtedness, equal to two and one-half percent of the value of the taxable property within the authority area, as the term "value of the taxable property" is defined in RCW 39.36.015, when the bonds are approved by three-fifths of the qualified electors of the authority at a general or special election called for that purpose and may provide for the retirement thereof by levies in excess of dollar rate limitations in accordance with the provisions of RCW 84.52.056. These elections will be held as provided in RCW 39.36.050;
