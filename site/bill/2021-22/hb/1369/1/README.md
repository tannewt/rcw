    a. For a notice of claim of wage lien on real property filed under this section, the notice must comply with the recording standards in chapter 65.04 RCW and the county auditor shall record the notice in the same manner as deeds and other instruments of title are recorded under chapter 65.08 RCW. Notices of claim of wage lien for registered land need not be recorded in the Torrens register.

    b. For a notice of claim of wage lien on personal property, including vehicles and vessels, filed under this section, the department of licensing shall record the notice.

6. The notice of claim of wage lien must be filed within a period of two years from when the wages were first due.

7. Mistakes or errors in the claimed amount owed do not invalidate the wage lien unless made with the intent to defraud.

8. A wage lien under this chapter attaches to all identifiable proceeds of the property subject to the wage lien except instruments and chattel paper.


## Section 5
The department of licensing shall file and index the financial statement filings under section 4 of this act in the same systems as those filings made under RCW 62A.9A-519.


## Section 6
Any wage lien or right of wage lien created by this chapter and the right of action to recover the wage lien is assignable so as to vest in the assignee all rights and remedies of the assignor, subject to all defenses thereto that might be made.


## Section 7
1. After a wage claim for which a wage lien has been recorded as to real property has been commenced in any court, but no later than eight months after the recording of the wage lien, the wage claimant or the claimant's assignee must file with the auditor of each county in which the property is situated a notice of the pendency of the wage claim, containing:

    a. The names of the parties and assignees, if any;

    b. The object of the action;

    c. A description of the real property located within that county; and

    d. The name of the court where the action was filed and the cause number for the action.

2. The county auditor must index the notice in a manner similar to the auditor practice for indexing a notice of lis pendens filed under RCW 4.28.320 or 4.28.325.

3. The filing of the notice under subsection (1) of this section is constructive notice to every subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer, and such purchaser or encumbrancer is bound by all proceedings taken after the filing of the notice to the same extent as if he or she were a party to the action.

4. The court in which the action was commenced may, at its discretion, at any time after the action is settled, discontinued, or abated, with notice and on a showing of good cause, order the notice canceled by the county auditor, and such cancellation shall be evidenced by the recording of the court order.

5. If a wage claim is filed with an administrative agency of a local government, that agency must file a notice under the provisions of this section, using a substantially similar form.

6. If a wage claim is filed with the department, the department must file a notice under the provisions of this section, using a substantially similar form.


## Section 8
1. A wage lien may be judicially foreclosed by an action in:

    a. For real property, a superior court in any county in this state, or in United States district court for any district in the state of Washington when the action is brought by the United States department of labor;

    b. For personal property, a district court of this state if the amount of the claim does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the district court provided in RCW 3.66.020; or

    c. For personal property, a superior court of this state if the amount of the claim exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the district court provided in RCW 3.66.020.

2. Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, an action to foreclose a wage lien may not be commenced more than eight months after the date the wage lien was recorded.

3. If the claimant has instituted an action in a court of this state for the wage claim that is the subject of the wage lien, and that court is the court authorized by subsection (1) of this section to foreclose on the lien, that action shall be deemed an action to foreclose on the property subject to the lien.

4. [Empty]

    a. If the claimant receives a judgment on a wage claim from a federal, state, or municipal court, the judgment, in addition to any applicable postjudgment interest, establishes the amount owed for the purposes of foreclosure under this chapter.

    b. If the claimant receives a judgment on a wage claim from a federal, state, or municipal court, that is not authorized to adjudicate the foreclosure of the claimant's wage lien, a separate action to foreclose the wage lien must be filed within 90 days of the date of that court's judgment. The entry of such a judgment shall not revive a wage lien that has been extinguished pursuant to section 10 of this act.

5. [Empty]

    a. A final and binding assessment of wages owed by the department or by any local agency with authority to adjudicate wage claims, in addition to any applicable postjudgment interest, establishes the amount owed for the purposes of foreclosure under this chapter.

    b. A wage lien may also be foreclosed by:

        i. The department using the department's collection procedures under RCW 49.48.086 when the claimant has pursued a wage claim in an administrative proceeding and a final and binding citation and notice of assessment has been issued;

        ii. The claimant if a final and binding citation and notice of assessment has been issued by the department and the claimant has timely notified the department that the claimant will pursue foreclosure action on his or her own, without the department's assistance; or

        iii. An administrative agency of a local government.

    c. The foreclosure pursuant to this subsection by the claimant of a wage lien affecting real property must be commenced by the filing of an action in superior court in the county where the real property is located within 90 days of the date the department's citation and notice of assessment becomes final and binding.

    d. The extinguishment of a wage lien pursuant to section 10 of this act does not preclude the department from using the collection procedures under RCW 49.48.086.

6. A foreclosure action may be brought by the employee individually, the department, an administrative agency of a local government, the United States department of labor, the office of the attorney general, or a representative of the employee, including a collective bargaining representative or class representative. Multiple wage claims against the same employer may be joined in a single proceeding, but the court may order separate trials or hearings.

7. In the judgment resulting from an action to foreclose on the wage lien, the court may order the sale at sheriff's auction or the transfer to the lien claimant of title or possession of any property subject to the wage lien. Whether or not the court makes such an order as part of the judgment, a writ of sale may be issued for any property subject to the wage lien for 10 years after a judgment for a wage claim is issued. A wage lien based on an underlying judgment continues in force for an additional 10-year period if the period of execution for the underlying judgment is extended under RCW 6.17.020.

8. In an action to foreclose on a wage lien on titled goods, the lien claimant must comply with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section and any other requirements of the department of licensing regarding transferring title and taking ownership of the vehicle or vessel.

9. A lien claimant who prevails in a foreclosure action is entitled to costs, including the cost of recording or filing the lien and costs of title reports, and reasonable attorneys' fees.


## Section 9
1. A lien under this chapter may be foreclosed and enforced as provided under section 8 of this act. The court shall have the power to order the sale of the property. In any action brought to foreclose a lien, the owner shall be joined as a party. The interest in the property of any person who, prior to the commencement of the action, has a recorded interest in the property, or any part thereof, shall not be foreclosed or affected unless they are joined as a party.

2. A person shall not begin an action to foreclose a lien upon any property while a prior action begun to foreclose another lien on the same property is pending, but if not made a party plaintiff or defendant to the prior action, he or she may apply to the court to be joined as a party thereto, and his or her lien may be foreclosed in the same action. The filing of such application shall toll the running of the period of limitation until disposition of the application or other time set by the court.

3. The court shall grant the application for joinder unless to do so would create an undue delay or cause hardship which cannot be cured by the imposition of costs or other conditions as the court deems just.

4. If a lien foreclosure action is filed during the pendency of another such action, the court may, on its own motion or the motion of any party, consolidate actions upon such terms and conditions as the court deems just, unless to do so would create an undue delay or cause hardship which cannot be cured by the imposition of costs or other conditions. If consolidation of actions is not permissible under this chapter, the lien foreclosure action filed during the pendency of another such action shall not be dismissed if the filing was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, or irregularity. An action to foreclose a lien shall not be dismissed at the instance of a plaintiff therein to the prejudice of another party to the suit who claims a lien.


## Section 10
1. A wage lien is extinguished:

    a. If an action for the underlying wage claim is not brought within eight months of the date the wage lien was recorded or if the notice required by section 7 of this act was not recorded within eight months of the date the wage lien was recorded;

    b. If the action for the underlying wage claim is dismissed with prejudice and no appeal is filed within the applicable appeals period. If an appeal is filed, the wage lien continues in force until final judgment is rendered;

    c. Upon payment and acceptance of payment for the employee's wage claim; or

    d. Upon proper recording or notice of a bond meeting the requirements of section 15 of this act and, if applicable, notification of the lien claimant as required under section 15 of this act.

2. [Empty]

    a. When the wage lien has been extinguished, the lien claimant shall release the lien in writing within 15 days. For liens on real property and titled goods, the lien claimant shall file a release of the wage lien at the place where the wage lien was recorded and pay a filing fee established by the agency where the notice is filed. For liens on personal property filed pursuant to section 4(3) of this act, the lien claimant shall file a termination statement of the type used pursuant to chapter 62A.9A RCW with the department of licensing and pay a filing fee established by the department.

    b. If a lien claimant fails to release the wage lien, upon demand and 15 days' notice by the employer or any affected party, mailed to the lien claimant's address as indicated on the notice of the wage lien by certified mail with return receipt requested, the employer or affected party may petition the court in which foreclosure is authorized under section 8 of this act, for an order releasing the wage lien. If no action to foreclose the lien claim has been filed, the clerk of the court shall assign a cause number to the application and obtain from the applicant a filing fee pursuant to RCW 36.18.016(18). If an action has been filed to foreclose the lien claim, the application shall be made a part of that action.

    c. If the lien claimant acted unreasonably and in bad faith in refusing to file a release of the wage lien, the employer or affected party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the action, and the court in its discretion may also issue a fine not to exceed $1,000.

    d. For liens on real property and titled goods, the release must include:

        i. The name, telephone number, address, and relationship to the wage lien of the person filing the notice;

        ii. The name, telephone number, and address of the lien claimant;

        iii. The name of the employer;

3. The person filing the release or termination statement shall mail a copy of the release or termination statement to the person against whom the lien claim was made by first-class mail within 10 days of filing the notice of release or termination.

4. [Empty]

    a. A release of wage lien on real property must comply with the recording standards established in RCW 65.04.045 and the county auditor shall record the release in the same manner as deeds and other instruments of title are recorded under chapter 65.08 RCW.

    b. For liens on real property and titled goods, a release of wage lien substantially in the following form is sufficient, provided it complies with the formatting requirements of RCW 65.04.045 (1)(a) and (b), (2), and (3):

## Section 11
1. Priority among wage liens recorded pursuant to this chapter is determined by date of recording. The first to be recorded has priority.

2. A wage lien as to real property recorded pursuant to this chapter shall be prior to any security interest, lien, mortgage, deed of trust, or other encumbrance that attached to the real property after, or was unrecorded at the time, such wage lien was recorded. A wage lien as to real property recorded pursuant to this chapter shall be subject and subordinate to any prior perfected security interest, lien, mortgage, deed of trust, or other encumbrance.

3. With respect to personal property:

    a. A security interest perfected pursuant to Title 62A RCW has priority over a wage lien recorded pursuant to this chapter if the security interest was perfected or a financing statement covering the collateral was filed before the wage lien was recorded, provided there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection. For the purposes of this subsection, the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds of the collateral.

    b. [Empty]

        i. A buyer of goods subject to a certificate of title that does not contain a statement that the goods are or may be subject to a wage lien takes free of a wage lien on such goods if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the goods without knowledge of the wage lien.

        ii. Third persons who, prior to the filing of the wage lien notice required under this chapter, acquired title in good faith, for value and without actual notice of the wage lien, to property other than goods; or

        iii.

## Section 12
A contract between an employer and employee may not waive or require an employee to waive the right to a wage lien under this chapter. A provision of a contract made in violation of this section is void as against the public policy of this state.


## Section 13
The claim of wage lien, when filed as required by this chapter, constitutes notice to the spouse or the domestic partner of the person who appears on record to be the owner of the property sought to be charged with the wage lien, and subjects all the community interest of both spouses or both domestic partners to the wage lien.


## Section 14
1. Any owner of real or personal property subject to a recorded claim of lien under this chapter, or lender or another lien claimant who believes the claim of lien to be frivolous and made without reasonable cause or clearly excessive, may apply by motion to the appropriate court, as specified under section 8 of this act, for the county where the property or some part thereof is located, for an order directing the lien claimant to appear before the court at a time no earlier than six nor later than 15 days following the date of service of the application and order on the lien claimant, and show cause, if any he or she has, why the relief requested should not be granted. The motion shall state the grounds upon which relief is asked and shall be supported by the affidavit of the applicant or his or her attorney setting forth a concise statement of the facts upon which the motion is based.

2. The order shall clearly state that if the lien claimant fails to appear at the time and place noted the lien shall be released, with prejudice, and that the lien claimant shall be ordered to pay the costs requested by the applicant including reasonable attorneys' fees.

3. If no action to foreclose the lien claim has been filed, the clerk of the court shall assign a cause number to the application and obtain from the applicant a filing fee pursuant to RCW 36.18.016(18). If an action has been filed to foreclose the lien claim, the application shall be made a part of that action.

4. If, following a hearing on the matter, the court determines that the lien is frivolous and made without reasonable cause, or clearly excessive, the court shall issue an order releasing the lien if frivolous and made without reasonable cause, or reducing the lien if clearly excessive, and awarding costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the applicant to be paid by the lien claimant. If the court determines that the lien is not frivolous and was made with reasonable cause, and is not clearly excessive, the court shall issue an order so stating and awarding costs and reasonable attorneys' fees to the lien claimant to be paid by the applicant.

5. Proceedings under this section shall not affect other rights and remedies available to the parties.


## Section 15
1. Any owner of property subject to a recorded claim of lien under this chapter, or lender or another lien claimant, who disputes the correctness or validity of the claim of lien, may either before or after the commencement of an action on the wage claim underlying the lien, furnish a bond issued by a surety company authorized to issue surety bonds in the state. The surety company must be listed in the latest federal department of the treasury list of surety companies acceptable on federal bonds, published in the federal register, as authorized to issue bonds on United States government projects with an underwriting limitation, including applicable reinsurance, equal to or greater than the amount of the bond to be recorded.

2. [Empty]

    a. The bond shall contain a description of the claim of lien and property involved, and must be in an amount equal to the greater of $5,000 or two times the amount of the lien claimed if the lien claimed is $10,000 or less, and in an amount equal to or greater than one and one-half times the amount of the lien if the lien claimed is in excess of $10,000.

    b. If the bond relates to a claim of lien affecting more than one parcel of real property and the claim of lien is segregated to each parcel, the bond may be segregated the same as in the claim of lien.

    c. A separate bond shall be required for each claim of lien made by separate claimants. However, a single bond may be used to guarantee payment of amounts claimed by more than one claim of lien by a single claimant so long as the amount of the bond meets the requirements of this section as applied to the aggregate sum of all claims by such claimant.

    d. The condition of the bond shall be to guarantee payment of any judgment or binding administrative assessment upon the lien in favor of the lien claimant entered in any action to recover the amount claimed in a claim of lien, or on the claim asserted in the claim of lien.

3. For a lien on real property, the bond must be recorded in the office of the county recorder or auditor in the county where the claim of lien was recorded. Recording a bond that meets the requirements of this section releases the real property described in the notice of claim of lien from the lien and any action brought to recover the amount claimed.

4. [Empty]

    a. For a lien on personal property, within five days of furnishing a bond, the person furnishing the bond shall send notice to the lien claimant, by certified mail return receipt requested, notifying the lien claimant that a bond meeting the requirements of this section has been furnished. The notification must include sufficient documentation or other evidence showing that a bond meeting the requirements of this section has been furnished.

    b. Within 15 days of receiving notice that a bond has been purchased, the lien claimant shall release the lien pursuant to section 10 of this act. If a lien claimant fails to release the wage lien as required, upon demand and 15 days' notice by the employer or any affected party, mailed to the lien claimant's address as indicated on the notice of the wage lien by certified mail with return receipt requested, the employer or affected party may petition the court in which foreclosure is authorized under section 8 of this act, for an order releasing the wage lien. If the lien claimant acted unreasonably and in bad faith in refusing to file a release of the wage lien, the employer or affected party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the action, and the court in its discretion may also issue a fine not to exceed $1,000.

5. [Empty]

    a. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if no action is commenced to recover on a lien within the time specified in section 10 of this act, the surety shall be discharged from liability under the bond.

    b. If an action to enforce the lien is timely commenced, then on payment of any judgment or administrative assessment entered in the action or on payment of the full amount of the bond to the holder of the judgment or administrative assessment, whichever is less, the surety shall be discharged from liability under the bond.

6. Nothing in this section shall in any way prohibit or limit the use of other methods, devised by the affected parties to secure the obligation underlying a claim of lien and to obtain a release of real property from a claim of lien.

## Section 18
> This section modifies existing section [49.48.086](/rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.48_wages—payment—collection.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.48_wages—payment—collection.md) for context.

1. After a final order is issued under RCW 49.48.084, if an employer defaults in the payment of: (a) Any wages determined by the department to be owed to an employee, including interest; or (b) any civil penalty ordered by the department under RCW 49.48.083, the director may file with the clerk of any county within the state a warrant in the amount of the payment plus any filing fees. The clerk of the county in which the warrant is filed shall immediately designate a superior court cause number for the warrant, and the clerk shall cause to be entered in the judgment docket under the superior court cause number assigned to the warrant, the name of the employer mentioned in the warrant, the amount of payment due on it plus any filing fees, and the date when the warrant was filed. The aggregate amount of the warrant as docketed becomes a lien upon the title to, and interest in, all real and personal property of the employer against whom the warrant is issued, the same as a judgment in a civil case docketed in the office of the clerk. The sheriff shall proceed upon the warrant in all respects and with like effect as prescribed by law with respect to execution or other process issued against rights or property upon judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. The warrant so docketed is sufficient to support the issuance of writs of garnishment in favor of the state in a manner provided by law in case of judgment, wholly or partially unsatisfied. The clerk of the court is entitled to a filing fee which will be added to the amount of the warrant. A copy of the warrant shall be mailed to the employer within three days of filing with the clerk.

2. [Empty]

    a. The director may issue to any person, firm, corporation, other entity, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, a public corporation, or any agency of the state, a notice and order to withhold and deliver property of any kind when he or she has reason to believe that there is in the possession of the person, firm, corporation, other entity, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state, property that is or will become due, owing, or belonging to an employer upon whom a notice of assessment has been served by the department for payments or civil penalties due to the department. The effect of a notice and order is continuous from the date the notice and order is first made until the liability out of which the notice and order arose is satisfied or becomes unenforceable because of lapse of time. The department shall release the notice and order when the liability out of which the notice and order arose is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time and shall notify the person against whom the notice and order was made that the notice and order has been released.

    b. The notice and order to withhold and deliver must be served by the sheriff of the county or by the sheriff's deputy, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by the director. A person, firm, corporation, other entity, municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state, public corporation, or agency of the state upon whom service has been made shall answer the notice within twenty days exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, and shall make true answers to the matters inquired of in the notice and order. Upon service of the notice and order, if the party served possesses any property that may be subject to the claim of the department, the party shall promptly deliver the property to the director. The director shall hold the property in trust for application on the employer's indebtedness to the department, or for return without interest, in accordance with a final determination of a petition for review. In the alternative, the party shall furnish a good and sufficient surety bond satisfactory to the director conditioned upon final determination of liability. If a party served and named in the notice fails to answer the notice within the time prescribed in this section, the court may render judgment by default against the party for the full amount claimed by the director in the notice, together with costs. If a notice is served upon an employer and the property subject to it is wages, the employer may assert in the answer all exemptions provided for by chapter 6.27 RCW to which the wage earner is entitled.

    c. As an alternative to the methods of service described in this section, the department may electronically serve a financial institution with a notice and order to withhold and deliver by providing a list of its outstanding warrants, except those for which a payment agreement is in good standing, to the department of revenue. The department of revenue may include the warrants provided by the department in a notice and order to withhold and deliver served under RCW 82.32.235(3). A financial institution that is served with a notice and order to withhold and deliver under this subsection (2)(c) must answer the notice within the time period applicable to service under RCW 82.32.235(3). The department and the department of revenue may adopt rules to implement this subsection (2)(c).

3. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the procedure for collection of wages owed, including interest, and civil penalties as set forth in this section, the department may recover wages owed, including interest, and civil penalties assessed under RCW 49.48.083 in a civil action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction of the county where the violation is alleged to have occurred.

    b. **The department may use the procedures under this section to foreclose wage liens established under chapter 60.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 22 of this act). When the department is foreclosing on a wage lien, the date the wage lien was originally filed shall be the date by which priority is determined, regardless of the date the warrant is filed under this section. If a claimant has timely notified the department that the claimant will pursue foreclosure on their own, without the department's assistance, the department is not required to file a warrant under this section and is relieved from any liability related to foreclosing on the claimant's wage lien.**

4. Whenever any employer quits business, sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the employer's business or stock of goods, any person who becomes a successor to the business becomes liable for the full amount of any outstanding citation and notice of assessment or penalty against the employer's business under this chapter if, at the time of the conveyance of the business, the successor has: (a) Actual knowledge of the fact and amount of the outstanding citation and notice of assessment or (b) a prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the outstanding citation and notice of assessment from the department. If the citation and notice of assessment or penalty is not paid in full by the employer within ten days of the date of the sale, exchange, or disposal, the successor is liable for the payment of the full amount of the citation and notice of assessment or penalty, and payment thereof by the successor must, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If the payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference becomes a debt due the successor from the employer.

5. This section does not affect other collection remedies that are otherwise provided by law.


## Section 19
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [43.24](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.024_department_of_licensing.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.024_department_of_licensing.md) for context.

For the purposes of implementing the notice and filing provisions under sections 4(2)(a) and 10 of this act that are applicable to the department of licensing, the department of licensing may, by rule, create wage lien forms specific to the department of licensing, so long as the forms include the information described in those sections.


## Section 20
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [43.24](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.024_department_of_licensing.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.024_department_of_licensing.md) for context.

The department of licensing wage lien account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from wage lien filing fees collected by the department of licensing must be deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only to administer wage lien filings in section 4 of this act.
