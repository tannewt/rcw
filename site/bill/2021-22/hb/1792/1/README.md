## Section 7
This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (section 4 of this act). The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

1. The legislature categorizes the tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).

2. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to: Increase the use of clean alternative fuel vehicles; encourage the use of clean alternative fuels by reducing the cost of the production and dispensing of fuel for clean alternative fuel vehicles; promote the construction and operation of renewable hydrogen and green electrolytic hydrogen production and dispensing facilities in Washington; and provide tax treatment parity for electricity available to produce hydrogen from all of Washington's utilities serving the clean fuels markets, and tax treatment parity with the electricity used to charge and serve other storage technologies and transportation fuel markets. It is the legislature's intent to meet these public policy objectives by providing a public utility excise tax exemption on the sale of electricity used in the production of green electrolytic hydrogen, the production of renewable hydrogen, and the compression, liquification, and dispensing of green electrolytic hydrogen and renewable hydrogen, to reduce the average cost of electricity, which represents between 70 and 75 percent of the overall cost of operation of hydrogen electrolyzers and related infrastructure.

3. To measure the effectiveness of the tax preferences in section 4, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (section 4 of this act) in achieving the public policy objectives described in subsection (2) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must, using calendar year 2021 as the baseline, evaluate the annual volumetric quantity of renewable hydrogen and green electrolytic hydrogen produced in the state, as well as the annual percentage of hydrogen produced in the state that is either green electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen.

4. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (3) of this section, the department of revenue must provide data needed for the joint legislative audit and review committee analysis. In addition to the data source described under this subsection, the joint legislative audit and review committee may use any other data it deems necessary.
