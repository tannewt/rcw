## Section 3
1. A person may not offer for sale, sell, distribute, or import into the state any product or packaging for which a deceptive or misleading claim about the recyclability of the product or packaging is made.

2. A product or packaging that displays a chasing arrows symbol, a chasing arrows symbol surrounding a resin identification code, or any other symbol or statement indicating the product or packaging is recyclable, or otherwise directing the consumer to recycle the product or packaging, is deemed to be a deceptive or misleading claim under this section unless the product or packaging is considered recyclable in the state under section 5 of this act and is of a material type and form that routinely becomes feedstock used in the production of new products or packaging.

    a. This section does not apply to either of the following:

        i. Any product or packaging that is manufactured up to 18 months after the date the department publishes the first material characterization study required under section 4 of this act, or before January 1, 2025, whichever is later; or

Any product or packaging manufactured up to 18 months after the date the department updates the material characterization study under section 4 of this act, if the product or packaging satisfied or, for a new product or packaging, would have satisfied, the requirements to be considered recyclable in the state under section 5 of this act before the publication of the updated study.

    b. For a product or packaging that is not considered to be recyclable in the state under section 5 of this act, all the following apply:

        i. Displaying a chasing arrows symbol or any other statement indicating the product is recyclable directly on the product is deemed to be deceptive or misleading under this section.

        ii. If a product or packaging has multiple material types, a chasing arrows symbol or statement indicating recyclability may be displayed on the external packaging that is considered to be recyclable in the state under section 5 of this act if the chasing arrows symbol or statement makes clear in the same or greater font, font size, or symbol size which other components of the product or packaging are not recyclable.

        iii. Displaying a chasing arrows symbol or any other statement indicating recyclability on packaging containing a consumable product shall, for purposes of this section, be deemed to refer only to the packaging.

    c. For the purposes of this subsection, "consumable product" means a commodity that is intended to be used and not disposed of.

    a. To get a representative sample of recycling programs in the state, the department shall conduct and publish on its website a characterization study of material types and forms that are collected, sorted, sold, or transferred by facilities that process recyclable materials from curbside recycling programs and other solid waste facilities deemed appropriate by the department for inclusion in the study.

    b. The material characterization study must:

        i. Identify what material types and forms are actively recovered, and not considered contaminants, by included operations or facilities; and

        ii. How the material collected or processed by the operations and facilities was collected.

2. The department shall update the material characterization study required under this section every five years, with the first update being issued by the department in 2028.

3. For each material characterization study conducted under this section, the department shall publish on its website the preliminary findings of the study and conduct a public meeting to present the preliminary findings and receive public comments.

7. The information published by the department under section 4 of this act may not limit the discretion of a local government under existing law to decide whether, and to what extent, a material type or form is accepted by a local recycling program.

        iii. The availability of recycled plastic suitable to meet the minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements pursuant to subsection (4), (5),  (6)**, (7) or (8)** of this section, including the availability of high quality recycled plastic, and food-grade recycled plastic from recycling programs;

        iv. The capacity of recycling or processing infrastructure;

        iii. For plastic trash bags, the department may not adjust the minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements above the minimum postconsumer recycled content percentages for the year under review required pursuant to subsection (6) of this section or below the minimum percentage required in subsection (6)(a) of this section.

    d. A producer or the manufacturing industry for a covered product may appeal a decision by the department to adjust postconsumer recycled content percentages under (a) of this subsection or to temporarily exclude covered products from minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements under subsection (10) of this section to the pollution control hearings board within 30 days of the department's determination.

10. The department must temporarily exclude from minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements for the upcoming year any types of covered products in plastic containers for which a producer annually demonstrates to the department by December 31st of a given year that the achievement of postconsumer recycled content requirements in the container material is not technically feasible in order to comply with health or safety requirements of federal law, including the federal laws specified in subsection (9)(b)(v) of this section. A producer must continue to register and report consistent with the requirements of this chapter for covered products temporarily excluded from minimum postconsumer recycled content requirements under this subsection.

11. A producer that does not achieve the postconsumer recycled content requirements established under this section is subject to penalties established in RCW 70A.245.040.
