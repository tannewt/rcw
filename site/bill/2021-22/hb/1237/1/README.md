## Section 1
1. This act is intended to provide a common definition for family resource centers across Washington state in an effort to establish a core set of principles for existing and newly forming family resource centers.

2. The legislature finds that family resource centers are effective in supporting communities when adhering to the following principles:

    a. Equality;

    b. Mutual respect;

    c. Families are resources to other families and the community;

    d. Strengthening families' cultural, racial, and linguistic identities;

    e. Embedding programs in the community;

    f. Fairness;

    g. Responsiveness;

    h. Accountability;

    i. Mobilization of formal and informal resources; and

    j. Flexibility.

3. The legislature further finds that families and parents are primarily responsible for supporting children's development and well-being at all ages and stages, and for preparing a child for success in school and life. However, many families may benefit from voluntary preventative or enriching support.

4. The legislature finds that family resource centers play a critical role in:

    a. Preventing child abuse and neglect;

    b. Strengthening children and families;

    c. Connecting family-impacting agencies and programs;

    d. Creating opportunities for community-level coordination; and

    e. Creating connections to resources and support systems.
