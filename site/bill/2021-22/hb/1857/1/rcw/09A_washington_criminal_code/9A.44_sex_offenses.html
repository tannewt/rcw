<li>
<p>In order to convict a person of any crime defined in this chapter it shall not be necessary that the testimony of the alleged victim be corroborated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence of the victim's past sexual behavior including but not limited to the victim's marital history, divorce history, or general reputation for promiscuity, nonchastity, or sexual mores contrary to community standards is inadmissible on the issue of credibility and is inadmissible to prove the victim's consent except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, but when the perpetrator and the victim have engaged in sexual intercourse with each other in the past, and when the past behavior is material to the issue of consent, evidence concerning the past behavior between the perpetrator and the victim may be admissible on the issue of consent to the offense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any prosecution for the crime of rape, trafficking pursuant to RCW 9A.40.100, or any of the offenses in chapter 9.68A RCW, or for an attempt to commit, or an assault with an intent to commit any such crime evidence of the victim's past sexual behavior including but not limited to the victim's marital behavior, divorce history, or general reputation for promiscuity, nonchastity, or sexual mores contrary to community standards is not admissible if offered to attack the credibility of the victim and is admissible on the issue of consent, except where prohibited in the underlying criminal offense, only pursuant to the following procedure:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A written pretrial motion shall be made by the defendant to the court and prosecutor stating that the defense has an offer of proof of the relevancy of evidence of the past sexual behavior of the victim proposed to be presented and its relevancy on the issue of the consent of the victim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The written motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit or affidavits in which the offer of proof shall be stated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court finds that the offer of proof is sufficient, the court shall order a hearing out of the presence of the jury, if any, and the hearing shall be closed except to the necessary witnesses, the defendant, counsel, and those who have a direct interest in the case or in the work of the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the conclusion of the hearing, if the court finds that the evidence proposed to be offered by the defendant regarding the past sexual behavior of the victim is relevant to the issue of the victim's consent; is not inadmissible because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will create a substantial danger of undue prejudice; and that its exclusion would result in denial of substantial justice to the defendant; the court shall make an order stating what evidence may be introduced by the defendant, which order may include the nature of the questions to be permitted. The defendant may then offer evidence pursuant to the order of the court.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit cross-examination of the victim on the issue of past sexual behavior when the prosecution presents evidence in its case in chief tending to prove the nature of the victim's past sexual behavior, but the court may require a hearing pursuant to subsection (3) of this section concerning such evidence.</p>

<p>A person who lacks a fixed residence must report weekly, in person, to the sheriff of the county where he or she is registered. The weekly report shall be on a day specified by the county sheriff's office, and shall occur during normal business hours. The person must keep an accurate accounting of where he or she stays during the week and provide it to the county sheriff upon request. The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered in determining an offender's risk level and shall make the offender subject to disclosure of information to the public at large pursuant to RCW 4.24.550.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any person required to register pursuant to this section does not have a fixed residence, it is an affirmative defense to the charge of failure to register, that he or she provided written notice to the sheriff of the county where he or she last registered within three business days of ceasing to have a fixed residence and has subsequently complied with the requirements of subsections (4)(a)(vi) or (vii) and (6) of this section. To prevail, the person must prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sex offender subject to registration requirements under this section who applies to change his or her name under RCW 4.24.130 or any other law shall submit a copy of the application to the county sheriff of the county of the person's residence and to the state patrol not fewer than five days before the entry of an order granting the name change. No sex offender under the requirement to register under this section at the time of application shall be granted an order changing his or her name if the court finds that doing so will interfere with legitimate law enforcement interests, except that no order shall be denied when the name change is requested for religious or legitimate cultural reasons or in recognition of marriage or dissolution of marriage. A sex offender under the requirement to register under this section who receives an order changing his or her name shall submit a copy of the order to the county sheriff of the county of the person's residence and to the state patrol within three business days of the entry of the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as may otherwise be provided by law, nothing in this section shall impose any liability upon a peace officer, including a county sheriff, or law enforcement agency, for failing to release information authorized under this section.</p>

<li>When an offender registers with the county sheriff pursuant to RCW 9A.44.130, the county sheriff shall notify the police chief or town marshal of the jurisdiction in which the offender has registered to live. If the offender registers to live in an unincorporated area of the county, the sheriff shall make reasonable attempts to verify that the offender is residing at the registered address. If the offender registers to live in an incorporated city or town, the police chief or town marshal shall make reasonable attempts to verify that the offender is residing at the registered address. Reasonable attempts include verifying an offender's address pursuant to the grant program established under RCW 36.28A.230. If the sheriff or police chief or town marshal does not participate in the grant program established under RCW 36.28A.230, reasonable attempts require a yearly mailing by certified mail, with return receipt requested, a nonforwardable verification form to the offender at the offender's last registered address sent by the chief law enforcement officer of the jurisdiction where the offender is registered to live. For offenders who have been previously designated sexually violent predators under chapter 71.09 RCW or the equivalent procedure in another jurisdiction, even if the designation has subsequently been removed, this mailing must be sent every ninety days.</li>

<p>Describe a violation of RCW 9A.40.100 (trafficking) or any offense identified in chapter 9.68A RCW (sexual exploitation of children); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe a violent offense as defined by RCW 9.94A.030 committed against a person known by or familiar to the child witness or by a person known by or familiar to the child witness;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The testimony is taken during the criminal proceeding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds by substantial evidence, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, that requiring the child witness to testify in the presence of the defendant will cause the child to suffer serious emotional or mental distress that will prevent the child from reasonably communicating at the trial. If the defendant is excluded from the presence of the child, the jury must also be excluded;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As provided in (a) and (b) of this subsection, the court may allow a child witness to testify in the presence of the defendant but outside the presence of the jury, via closed-circuit television, if the court finds, upon motion and hearing outside the presence of the jury, that the child will suffer serious emotional distress that will prevent the child from reasonably communicating at the trial in front of the jury, or, that although the child may be able to reasonably communicate at trial in front of the jury, the child will suffer serious emotional or mental distress from testifying in front of the jury. If the child is able to communicate in front of the defendant but not the jury the defendant will remain in the room with the child while the jury is excluded from the room;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds that the prosecutor has made all reasonable efforts to prepare the child witness for testifying, including informing the child or the child's parent or guardian about community counseling services, giving court tours, and explaining the trial process. If the prosecutor fails to demonstrate that preparations were implemented or the prosecutor in good faith attempted to implement them, the court shall deny the motion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court balances the strength of the state's case without the testimony of the child witness against the defendant's constitutional rights and the degree of infringement of the closed-circuit television procedure on those rights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds that no less restrictive method of obtaining the testimony exists that can adequately protect the child witness from the serious emotional or mental distress;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the court allows the child witness to testify outside the presence of the defendant, the defendant can communicate constantly with the defense attorney by electronic transmission and be granted reasonable court recesses during the child's testimony for person-to-person consultation with the defense attorney;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court can communicate with the attorneys by an audio system so that the court can rule on objections and otherwise control the proceedings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All parties in the room with the child witness are on camera and can be viewed by all other parties. If viewing all participants is not possible, the court shall describe for the viewers the location of the prosecutor, defense attorney, and other participants in relation to the child;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds that the television equipment is capable of making an accurate reproduction and the operator of the equipment is competent to operate the equipment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court imposes reasonable guidelines upon the parties for conducting the filming to avoid trauma to the child witness or abuse of the procedure for tactical advantage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The prosecutor, defense attorney, and a neutral and trained victim's advocate, if any, shall always be in the room where the child witness is testifying. The court in the court's discretion depending on the circumstances and whether the jury or defendant or both are excluded from the room where the child is testifying, may remain or may not remain in the room with the child.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>During the hearing conducted under subsection (1) of this section to determine whether the child witness may testify outside the presence of the defendant and/or the jury, the court may conduct the observation and examination of the child outside the presence of the defendant if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The prosecutor alleges and the court concurs that the child witness will be unable to testify in front of the defendant or will suffer severe emotional or mental distress if forced to testify in front of the defendant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant can observe and hear the child witness by closed-circuit television;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant can communicate constantly with the defense attorney during the examination of the child witness by electronic transmission and be granted reasonable court recesses during the child's examination for person-to-person consultation with the defense attorney; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court finds the closed-circuit television is capable of making an accurate reproduction and the operator of the equipment is competent to operate the equipment. Whenever possible, all the parties in the room with the child witness shall be on camera so that the viewers can see all the parties. If viewing all participants is not possible, then the court shall describe for the viewers the location of the prosecutor, defense attorney, and other participants in relation to the child.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court shall make particularized findings on the record articulating the factors upon which the court based its decision to allow the child witness to testify via closed-circuit television pursuant to this section. The factors the court may consider include, but are not limited to, a consideration of the child's age, physical health, emotional stability, expressions by the child of fear of testifying in open court or in front of the defendant, the relationship of the defendant to the child, and the court's observations of the child's inability to reasonably communicate in front of the defendant or in open court. The court's findings shall identify the impact the factors have upon the child's ability to testify in front of the jury or the defendant or both and the specific nature of the emotional or mental trauma the child would suffer. The court shall determine whether the source of the trauma is the presence of the defendant, the jury, or both, and shall limit the use of the closed-circuit television accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not apply if the defendant is an attorney pro se unless the defendant has a court-appointed attorney assisting the defendant in the defense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section may not preclude the presence of both the child witness and the defendant in the courtroom together for purposes of establishing or challenging the identification of the defendant when identification is a legitimate issue in the proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Washington supreme court may adopt rules of procedure regarding closed-circuit television procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All recorded tapes of testimony produced by closed-circuit television equipment shall be subject to any protective order of the court for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the child witness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section creates a right of the child witness to a closed-circuit television procedure in lieu of testifying in open court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state shall bear the costs of the closed-circuit television procedure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A child witness may or may not be a victim in the proceeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section precludes the court, under other circumstances arising under subsection (1)(a) of this section, from allowing a child to testify outside the presence of the defendant and the jury so long as the testimony is presented in accordance with the standards and procedures required in this section.</p>
