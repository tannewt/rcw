# House Bill 1404

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1404.pdf)
## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [28A.185.020](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.185_highly_capable_students.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.185_highly_capable_students.md) for context.

The legislature finds that, for highly capable students, access to accelerated learning and enhanced instruction is access to a basic education. There are multiple definitions of highly capable, from intellectual to academic to artistic. The research literature strongly supports using multiple criteria to identify highly capable students, and therefore, the legislature does not intend to prescribe a single method. Instead, the legislature intends to  authorize school districts to identify through the use of multiple, objective criteria those students most highly capable and eligible to receive accelerated learning and enhanced instruction in the program offered by the district.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [28A.185](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.185_highly_capable_students.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.185_highly_capable_students.md) for context.

1. The legislature intends to allocate state funding for basic education programs for highly capable students based on five percent of each school district's student population.

2. Funds provided by the state for the state basic education program for highly capable students under RCW 28A.150.260 shall be categorical funding to provide services to highly capable students as determined by a school district under RCW 28A.185.030. However, school districts must use a portion of the funds provided under this subsection to deliver professional development in accordance with section 9(2) of this act.

3. Funds provided by the state for student transportation to and from school includes transportation to and from programs for highly capable students as defined in RCW 28A.160.160, and must be expended in accordance with chapter 28A.160 RCW.

4. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, each school district must conduct universal screenings in accordance with RCW 28A.185.030 to find students who need further assessment for potential gifted program placement.

1. **S**chool districts may establish and operate, either separately or jointly, programs for highly capable students. Such authority shall include the right to employ and pay special instructors and to operate such programs jointly with a public institution of higher education.

2. **S**chool districts **that** establish and operate programs for highly capable students shall adopt identification procedures and provide educational opportunities as follows:

    a. In accordance with rules adopted by the superintendent of public instruction, school districts shall implement procedures for **referral**, **screening,** assessment **,** selection**, and placement** of their most highly capable students.

        i. **Referrals must** be based upon data from teachers, other staff, parents, students, and members of the community.

        ii. **Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, each school district must conduct universal screenings for each student at least once, in or before second and sixth grade, to find students who need further assessment to determine whether the student is eligible for potential placement in a program for highly capable students. The district must use a portion of the funds appropriated to provide the screenings within the school day and at the school the student attends.**

        iii. Assessment**s****for highly capable program services must** be based upon a review of each student's capability as shown by multiple criteria intended to reveal, from a wide variety of sources and data, each student's unique needs and capabilities. **Assessments must be conducted within the school day and at the school the student attends.**

        iv. Selection **and placements** shall be made by a **multidisciplinary selection committee** after consideration of the results of the multiple criteria assessment. **The committee members must have at least five hours of course work or professional development addressing the needs and characteristics of highly capable students. Students selected pursuant to procedures outlined in this section shall be provided, to the extent feasible, an educational opportunity that takes into account each student's unique needs and capabilities, and the limits of the resources and program options available to the district, including those options that can be developed or provided using funds allocated by the superintendent of public instruction for that specific purpose.**

    b. **In addition to the criteria listed in (a) of this subsection, district practices for identifying the most highly capable students must prioritize equitable identification of low-income students.**

1. In order to ensure that school districts are meeting the requirements of an approved program for highly capable students, the superintendent of public instruction shall monitor highly capable programs at least once every five years. Monitoring shall begin during the 2002-03 school year.

2. Any program review and monitoring under this section may be conducted concurrently with other program reviews and monitoring conducted by the office of the superintendent of public instruction. In its review, the office shall monitor program components that include but need not be limited to the process used by the district to identify and reach out to highly capable students with diverse talents and from diverse backgrounds, assessment data and other indicators to determine how well the district is meeting the academic needs of highly capable students, and district expenditures used to enrich or expand opportunities for these students.
