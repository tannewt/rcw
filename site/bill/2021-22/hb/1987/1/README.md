## Section 1
The legislature finds that affordable housing and homelessness are some of the most pressing issues facing Washington state today. These issues are not isolated to any one part of our state, rather they are challenges being faced by every jurisdiction across the state.

The legislature finds a need for a more holistic approach to housing and homelessness issues and a need to better align state policies across agencies and in partnership with local jurisdictions and community-based programs to achieve this.

Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a task force to recommend an organizational structure for a new department focused solely on issues of housing and homelessness. The task force will create a blueprint for a new department to better align housing and homelessness programs that currently span across multiple agencies and partners.
