<ol>
<li>The legislature recognizes Washington's tax system is the most regressive in the nation because it asks those making the least to pay the most as a percentage of their income. This makes household costs, like child care and food, even more burdensome. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, middle-income families in Washington paid two to four times in taxes, as a percentage of household income, as compared to top earners in the state. Low-income Washingtonians paid six times more than did our wealthiest residents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since March, this has been exacerbated as the world's wealthiest have seen their wealth increase dramatically while families struggled to pay for essentials like food and rent. In fact, billionaires have seen their wealth increase 57 percent on average throughout the pandemic. At the same time, 100,000 people in Washington have signed up for food and cash assistance, and temporary assistance for needy families has increased significantly, including doubling in some counties east of the Cascade mountains.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the impact of COVID-19 to businesses has been devastating. The hospitality and leisure industry alone has lost a net of 100,000 jobs since spring. Nine months into the pandemic, employment declines are still 30 percent greater than the deepest point in the great recession a decade ago, and 7 percent of the state's workforce is collecting unemployment.</p>
<p>The child care industry, possibly the most critical infrastructure for our economic recovery, is in dire crisis, and it is costing Washington families and businesses. The lack of child care access in Washington costs businesses $2,080,000,000 a year, and working parents forgo $14,000,000,000 a year in lost wages.</p>
<p>To address the economic and child care crises in a fair and equitable way, we must invest in our child care system to sustain diverse child care businesses, ensure families can access affordable child care, and spur economic recovery.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that a tax system that is fair, balanced, and works for everyone is essential to help all Washingtonians grow and thrive. Our tax system must strengthen the middle-class economy, help low-income and middle-income families, and ask the wealthiest among us, who are benefiting the most in our economy and current tax structure, to contribute their fair share. We must ensure our tax structure is funding critical needs like behavioral health, housing for homeless and working families, feeding seniors, providing school counselors and nurses, or supporting innovation.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The excise tax on capital gains is a tax on the one-time, voluntary sale or transfer of a capital asset, not a tax on ownership of the asset itself. This excise tax is paid only by those Washington residents who engage in such voluntary sales or transfers, and is measured by the realization of significant gain on the transaction. In order to protect against further regressive impacts of the tax system, encourage the everyday investments that Washingtonians of all income levels strive for, and support our economy, this excise tax will not apply to capital gains realized by certain sales and transfers. The legislature specifically finds and declares that the excise tax on the voluntary sale or transfer of capital assets is necessary for the support of state government and its existing institutions.</li>

<li>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2022, a tax is imposed on all individuals for the privilege of selling or exchanging long-term capital assets as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The tax equals seven percent multiplied by the individual's Washington capital gains on real property; and</p>

To the extent that a loss carryforward is included in the calculation of an individual's federal net long-term capital gain, as defined in section 201(3) of this act, and that loss carryforward is directly attributable to losses from sales or exchanges allocated to this state under section 207 of this act, the loss carryforward is included in the calculation of that individual's adjusted capital gain.

<p>If the federal income tax liabilities of both spouses are determined on a joint federal return for the taxable year, they must file a joint return under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the federal income tax liability of either spouse is determined on a separate federal return for the taxable year, they must file separate returns under this chapter.

<ol>
<li>
<p>To avoid taxing the same sale or exchange under both the business and occupation tax and the capital gains tax, a credit is allowed against taxes due under this chapter on a sale or exchange that is also subject to the tax imposed under section 202 of this act. The credit is equal to the amount of tax imposed under this chapter on a sale or exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The credit may be used against any tax due under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The credit under this section is earned in regards to a sale or exchange, and may be claimed against the taxes due under this chapter, for the tax reporting period in which the sale or exchange occurred. The credit claimed for a tax reporting period may not exceed the tax otherwise due under this chapter for that reporting period. Unused credit may not be carried forward or backward to another tax reporting period. No refunds may be granted for unused credit under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department must apply the credit first to taxes deposited into the general fund. If any remaining credit reduces the amount of taxes deposited into the workforce education investment account created in RCW 43.79.195, the department must notify the state treasurer of such amounts monthly, and the state treasurer must transfer those amounts from the general fund to the workforce education investment account.</p>

<p>The department may enter into reciprocal tax collection agreements with the taxing officials of any other state imposing a specified tax.

Such agreements may also include provisions governing the sharing of information relevant to the administration of specified taxes. However, the department may not share return or tax information with other states except as allowed under RCW 82.32.330. Likewise, the department may not share federal tax information with other states without the express written consent of the internal revenue service.</p>
