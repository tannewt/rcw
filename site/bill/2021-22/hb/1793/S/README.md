        ii. Is in conflict with the provisions of this section.

    b. Nothing in this section prohibits an association from imposing reasonable restrictions on electric vehicle charging stations. However, it is the policy of the state to promote, encourage, and remove obstacles to the use of electric vehicle charging stations.

3. [Empty]

    a. If approval is required for the installation or use of an electric vehicle charging station, the application for approval must be processed and approved in the same manner as an application for approval of an architectural modification.

    b. The approval or denial of an application must be in writing and must not be willfully avoided or delayed.

    d. An association of apartment owners may not assess or charge an apartment owner a fee for the placement of an electric vehicle charging station. An association may charge a reasonable fee for processing the application to approve the installation of an electric vehicle charging station, but only if such a fee exists for all applications for approval of architectural modifications.

4. If approval is required for the installation or use of an electric vehicle charging station, an association of apartment owners must approve the installation in a designated parking space if the installation is reasonably possible and the apartment owner agrees in writing to:

        ii. A certificate of insurance required under (c)(i) of this subsection must be provided within 14 days after the association approves the installation of the electric vehicle charging station. Reimbursement for an increased insurance premium amount under (c)(i) of this subsection must be provided within 14 days after the apartment owner receives the association's invoice for the amount attributable to the charging station;

    d. Register the electric vehicle charging station with the association within 30 days after installation;

    e. Pay for the electricity usage associated with the electric vehicle charging station and the required means to facilitate payment for the electricity; and

9. If an association of apartment owners reasonably determines that the cumulative use of electricity in the common interest community attributable to the installation and use of electric vehicle charging stations requires the installation of additional infrastructure improvements to provide the community with a sufficient supply of electricity, the association may assess the cost of the infrastructure improvements against each apartment owner that has, or will, install an electric vehicle charging station.

10. An association of apartment owners may install an electric vehicle charging station in the common areas for the use of all apartment owners and, in that case, the association must develop appropriate terms of use for the charging station.
