## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [82.12](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.12_use_tax.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.12_use_tax.md) for context.

1. This chapter does not apply to the use of reusable packing materials that are part of a packing material sharing and reuse program.

2. For purposes of this section, "packing material sharing and reuse program" and "reusable packing materials" have the same meanings as in RCW 82.04.050(4)(c).
