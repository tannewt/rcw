Filing a complaint does not make a complainant a party to the commission's action.

2. **Except as provided in subsection (3)(b) of this section, the** commission has sole discretion whether to investigate a complaint, and the commission has sole discretion whether to investigate matters relating to certification, denial of certification, or revocation of certification on any other basis, without restriction as to the source or the existence of a complaint. **All complaints must be resolved with a written determination, regardless of the decision to investigate.**

    a. **The commission may initiate an investigation in any instance where there is a pattern of complaints or other actions that may not have resulted in a formal adjudication of wrongdoing, but when considered together demonstrate a pattern of similar conduct.**

    b. **The commission shall initiate an investigation when an officer is the subject of three complaints of excessive use of force in the previous five years.**

1. If the commission determines, upon investigation, that there is  cause to believe that a peace officer's **or corrections officer's** certification should be denied**, suspended,** or revoked under RCW 43.101.105, the commission must prepare and serve upon the officer a statement of charges. Service on the officer must be by mail or by personal service on the officer **unless the officer has consented to service in some other manner, including electronic notification**.

The statement of charges must be accompanied by a notice that to receive a hearing on the denial or revocation, the officer must, within **14** days of  the statement of charges, request a hearing before the hearings **panel** appointed under RCW 43.101.380. Failure of the officer to request a hearing within the **14-day** period constitutes a default, whereupon the commission may enter an order under RCW 34.05.440.

2. If a hearing is requested, the **officer is required to provide an email address that constitutes the officer's legal address for purposes of any subsequent communication from the commission. Unless otherwise agreed to by the mutual agreement of the parties or for good cause, within two weeks of receipt of the officer's request for a hearing, the commission shall set a** date **for** the hearing**, which** must be **held within 90 days thereafter**. **On the date the hearing is set, the** commission shall **transmit electronic** notice of **the** hearing **to the officer, and provide public notice on the commission website**, specifying the time, date, and place of hearing.

1. [Empty]

    a. **Other than those records detailed in subsection (4) of this section, county**, municipal, and other local government agencies may request authority to destroy noncurrent public records having no further administrative or legal value by submitting to the division of archives and records management lists of such records on forms prepared by the division. The archivist, a representative appointed by the state auditor, and a representative appointed by the attorney general shall constitute a committee, known as the local records committee, which shall review such lists and which may veto the destruction of any or all items contained therein.

    b. A local government agency, as an alternative to submitting lists, may elect to establish a records control program based on recurring disposition schedules recommended by the agency to the local records committee. The schedules are to be submitted on forms provided by the division of archives and records management to the local records committee, which may either veto, approve, or amend the schedule. Approval of such schedule or amended schedule shall be by unanimous vote of the local records committee. Upon such approval, the schedule shall constitute authority for the local government agency to destroy the records listed thereon, after the required retention period, on a recurring basis until the schedule is either amended or revised by the committee.

2. [Empty]

    a. Except as otherwise provided by law, **and other than the law enforcement records detailed in subsection (4) of this section,** no public records shall be destroyed until approved for destruction by the local records committee. Official public records shall not be destroyed unless:

        i. The records are six or more years old;

        ii. The department of origin of the records has made a satisfactory showing to the state records committee that the retention of the records for a minimum of six years is both unnecessary and uneconomical, particularly where lesser federal retention periods for records generated by the state under federal programs have been established; or

        iii. The originals of official public records less than six years old have been copied or reproduced by any photographic, photostatic, microfilm, miniature photographic, or other process approved by the state archivist which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for so reproducing the original.

An automatic reduction of retention periods from seven to six years for official public records on record retention schedules existing on June 10, 1982, shall not be made, but the same shall be reviewed individually by the local records committee for approval or disapproval of the change to a retention period of six years.

The state archivist may furnish appropriate information, suggestions, and guidelines to local government agencies for their assistance in the preparation of lists and schedules or any other matter relating to the retention, preservation, or destruction of records under this chapter. The local records committee may adopt appropriate regulations establishing procedures to be followed in such matters.

Records of county, municipal, or other local government agencies, designated by the archivist as of primarily historical interest, may be transferred to a recognized depository agency.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Records of investigative reports prepared by any state, county, municipal, or other law enforcement agency pertaining to sex offenders contained in chapter 9A.44 RCW or sexually violent offenses as defined in RCW 71.09.020 that are not required in the current operation of the law enforcement agency or for pending judicial proceedings shall, following the expiration of the applicable schedule of the law enforcement agency's retention of the records, be transferred to the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs for permanent electronic retention and retrieval. Upon electronic retention of any document, the association shall be permitted to destroy the paper copy of the document.

        ii. Any sealed record transferred to the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs for permanent electronic retention and retrieval, including records sealed after transfer, shall be electronically retained in such a way that the record is clearly marked as sealed.

        iii. The Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs shall be permitted to destroy both the paper copy and electronic record of any offender verified as deceased.

    c. Any record transferred to the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs pursuant to (b) of this subsection shall be deemed to no longer constitute a public record pursuant to RCW 42.56.010 and shall be exempt from public disclosure. Such records shall be disseminated only to criminal justice agencies as defined in RCW 10.97.030 for the purpose of determining if a sex offender met the criteria of a sexually violent predator as defined in chapter 71.09 RCW and the end-of-sentence review committee as defined by RCW 72.09.345 for the purpose of fulfilling its duties under RCW 71.09.025 and 9.95.420.

Electronic records marked as sealed shall only be accessible by criminal justice agencies as defined in RCW 10.97.030 who would otherwise have access to a sealed paper copy of the document, the end-of-sentence review committee as defined by RCW 72.09.345 for the purpose of fulfilling its duties under RCW 71.09.025 and 9.95.420, and the system administrator for the purposes of system administration and maintenance.

3. Except as otherwise provided by law, county, municipal, and other local government agencies may, as an alternative to destroying noncurrent public records having no further administrative or legal value, donate the public records to the state library, local library, historical society, genealogical society, or similar society or organization.

Public records may not be donated under this subsection unless:

    a. The records are seventy years old or more;

    b. The local records committee has approved the destruction of the public records; and

    c. The state archivist has determined that the public records have no historic interest.

4. **Personnel records for any peace officer or corrections officer must be retained for the duration of the officer's employment and a minimum of 10 years thereafter. Such records include all misconduct and equal employment opportunity complaints, progressive discipline imposed including written reprimands, supervisor coaching, suspensions, involuntary transfers, other disciplinary appeals and litigation records, and any other records needed to comply with the requirements set forth in RCW 43.101.095 and 43.101.135.**

1. The procedures governing adjudicative proceedings before agencies under chapter 34.05 RCW, the administrative procedure act, govern hearings before the commission and govern all other actions before the commission unless otherwise provided in this chapter. The standard of proof in actions before the commission is **a preponderance of the** evidence.

2. In all hearings requested under RCW 43.101.155 , **an administrative law judge appointed under chapter 34.12 RCW shall be the presiding officer, shall make all necessary rulings in the course of the hearing, and shall issue a proposed recommendation, but is not entitled to vote. In addition,** a **three-member** hearings panel shall  hear the case and make the commission's final administrative decision.

3. The commission shall appoint **a panel** to hear certification actions **as follows**:

    a. When a hearing is requested in relation to a certification action of a Washington peace officer , the commission shall appoint to the panel: (i) One police chief**or** sheriff **from an agency not a current or past employer of the peace officer**; (ii) **one civilian member of the commission as appointed under RCW 43.101.030(1) (f) through (h); and (iii) one person with expertise and background in police accountability who is not a current or former peace officer or corrections officer**.

    b.

When a hearing is requested in relation to a certification action of a Washington corrections officer, the commission shall appoint to the panel: (i) **A person who heads** either a city or county corrections agency or facility or of a Washington state department of corrections facility; (ii) **one civilian member of the commission as appointed under RCW 43.101.030(1) (f) through (h)**; and (iii) one person **with expertise and background in police accountability** who is not  a **current or former peace officer or** corrections officer .

    d. Persons appointed to hearings panels by the commission shall, in relation to any certification action on which they sit, have the powers, duties, and immunities, and are entitled to the emoluments, including travel expenses in accordance with RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060, of regular commission members.

4. **In decertification matters where there was a criminal hearing, a due process hearing, a disciplinary appeals hearing,****or a finding entered by a law enforcement agency following an investigation,** the hearings panel need not redetermine the underlying facts but may make **its** determination based solely on review of the records and decision relating to **those** proceeding**s and any investigative or summary materials from the administrative law judge, legal counsel, and commission staff**. However, the hearings panel may, in its discretion, consider additional evidence to determine whether **misconduct** occurred . The hearings panel shall, upon written request by the subject peace officer or corrections officer, allow the peace officer or corrections officer to present additional evidence of extenuating circumstances.

5. **The commission is authorized to proceed regardless of whether an arbitrator or other appellate decision maker overturns the discipline imposed by the officer's employing agency or whether the agency settles an appeal. No action or failure to act by a law enforcement agency or corrections agency or decision resulting from an appeal of that action precludes action by the commission to suspend or revoke an officer's certificate or to require remedial training for the officer.**

6. **The hearings, but not the deliberations of the hearings panel, are open to the public. The transcripts, admitted evidence, and written decisions of the hearings panel on behalf of the commission are not confidential or exempt from public disclosure, and are subject to subpoena and discovery proceedings in civil actions.**

7. **Summary records of hearing dispositions must be made available on an annual basis on a public website.**

8. The commission's final administrative decision is subject to judicial review under RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.
