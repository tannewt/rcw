## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [70A.25](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.025_motor_vehicle_emission_control.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.025_motor_vehicle_emission_control.md) for context.

1. By July 1, 2022, the department shall establish a baseline for emissions of greenhouse gases for vehicles used on online-enabled applications or platforms of commercial transportation services providers on a per-passenger-mile traveled basis. The baseline calculation must use data from calendar year 2018 and include:

    a. Miles driven with no passenger delivery in the vehicle when the operator of the vehicle is logged in to a provider's digital platform or software application; and

    b. Miles driven with one or more passengers in the vehicle as a prearranged ride.

2. Commercial transportation services providers must provide information to the department covering individual calendar years, consistent with a reporting schedule and criteria to be adopted by rule by the department. The department may require commercial transportation services providers to provide data regarding the number of vehicles operating in Washington by city and by county. The department must use the provided information to determine average emissions of greenhouse gases per passenger-mile including, but not limited to:

    a. The total miles driven by vehicles operated to provide commercial transportation services in Washington state;

    b. The percent share of miles traveled by zero emission vehicles;

    c. The miles-weighted average network-wide grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per mile, for purposes of producing an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions; and

    d. Total passenger-miles traveled using an average passengers-per-trip estimate to account for trips where exact passenger head count data was not captured.

3. The department may use reasonable methods to adjust and correct data and emission estimates including, but not limited to:

    a. Methods to apportion emissions between commercial transportation services providers to account for: (i) Circumstances in which multiple applications or platforms are simultaneously used by a vehicle provider; or (ii) periods when vehicle providers are driving primarily for purposes other than engaging with services provided by the commercial transportation service provider, even though the latter party may be recording data on the vehicle provider's movement; and

    b. Methods to account for passenger-miles provided via zero-emissions transportation or public transit, other than a motor vehicle, offered in connection with a commercial transportation services provider's digital network.

4. The department may establish a baseline for a commercial transportation services provider that begins operating in Washington after calendar year 2018 with consideration of the baselines established under subsection (1) of this section and the information received by the department under subsection (2) of this section.


## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [70A.25](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.025_motor_vehicle_emission_control.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.025_motor_vehicle_emission_control.md) for context.

1. By July 1, 2023, the department shall adopt by rule and implement mandatory annual goals and targets that begin in 2025 for each commercial transportation services provider for the reduction under the baseline established under section 2 of this act for emissions of greenhouse gases per passenger-mile. The department may establish alternate timelines for the goals and targets for a commercial transportation services provider that begins covered operations in Washington after calendar year 2018. The goals and targets must:

    a. Include annual targets and goals for increasing the percentage of passenger-miles traveled using zero emission vehicles;

    b. Be technically and economically feasible;

    c. Be informed by data reported by commercial transportation services providers to the department; and

    d. Be designed with consideration of the state greenhouse gas emission limits of RCW 70A.45.020 and the state vehicle miles traveled goals of RCW 47.01.440.

2. The department may delay implementation of the targets and goals adopted under this section if the department finds that unanticipated barriers exist to expanding the usage of zero emission vehicles by commercial transportation services providers. No less frequently than every two years, the department must review available data related to barriers to usage of zero emission vehicles by commercial transportation services providers, including data related to current and future electric transportation adoption rates and charging infrastructure utilization rates.

3. [Empty]

    a. Beginning January 1, 2024, each commercial transportation services provider must develop and submit to the department a greenhouse gas emission reduction plan. The department may establish alternate deadlines for the submission of a plan by a commercial transportation services provider that begins operating in Washington as a covered entity after calendar year 2018. The department shall review the plan within one hundred eighty days of receipt of the plan, including a review of the plan for compliance with subsections (4) and (5) of this section, and decide whether to approve the plan. If a plan is rejected, the department shall provide the reasons for rejecting the plan to the commercial transportation services provider. The commercial transportation services provider must submit a new plan within sixty days after receipt of the letter of disapproval. Each commercial transportation services provider must implement a greenhouse gas emission reduction plan by January 1, 2025.

    b. A commercial transportation services provider must submit a plan amendment to the department no less than forty-five days before the commercial transportation services provider plans to begin implementing a substantial change to the commercial transportation services provider's plan. Within forty-five days of receipt of a plan amendment, the department must decide whether to approve the plan amendment and must provide the reasons for rejecting the plan amendment.

4. Greenhouse gas emission reduction plans must contain proposals for meeting the goals and targets established in subsection (1) of this section through, at a minimum:

    a. Increasing the proportion of vehicles used to complete trips that are zero emission vehicles;

    b. Increasing the proportion of vehicle miles completed by zero emission vehicles relative to the proportion of overall vehicle miles;

    c. Decreasing the average gram-per-mile greenhouse gas emission rates for vehicle miles traveled; and

    d. Increasing the proportion of passenger-miles traveled relative to overall vehicle miles traveled.

5. Plans developed under this section by each commercial transportation services provider must also:

    a. Consider incentives to encourage increasing the share of total miles traveled by passengers whose walking, biking, or other active or zero emission modes of transportation are facilitated using vehicles on an online-enabled application or platform; and

    b. Outline actions that a commercial transportation services provider will take to ensure that the plan will not result in negative financial outcomes for drivers relative to existing operational conditions.

6. The department may allow plans to achieve credit towards the goals and targets established in subsection (1) of this section through the provision, funding, or other financial support of transportation electrification infrastructure by the commercial transportation services provider that is used to support commercial transportation services provider company vehicle charging.

7. Plans required under this section must be updated and resubmitted to the department by January 1, 2026, and each January 1st of even-numbered years thereafter, with implementation of resubmitted plans commencing January 1, 2027, and each January 1st of odd-numbered years thereafter.
