# House Bill 1110

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1110.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Washington's public health system faces significant challenges. For Washington to have effective health boards, the boards need to have balanced representation of elected officials with nonelected individuals who have knowledge of health and public health issues and knowledge of diversity through lived experiences. Health inequities for people of color, Native Americans, low-income individuals and families, and those in rural communities with limited health services can be exacerbated by lack of representation on health boards. It is recognized that better health outcomes will occur when appointments for nonelected board of health positions are made using an equity lens. Further, consumers of public health tend to be not well represented as members of local health boards. There is a clear need for broader representation of consumers that face large health inequities or are direct recipients of public health services, such as the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children; the supplemental nutrition program; home visiting; or treatment services.

2. The lack of expertise and lived experience on local health boards has led to politics infecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic with local public health department leaders and workers resigning, retiring, or being fired, and communities being left sick and vulnerable.

3. The legislature therefore intends for Washington to have local health boards that balance representation of elected officials and nonelected people with a diversity of expertise and lived experience and have a decision-making process that is inclusive and puts public health and people ahead of politics to improve health outcomes.
