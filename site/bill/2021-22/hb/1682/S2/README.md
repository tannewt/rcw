[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1682-S2.pdf)
## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [70A.65.110](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.065_greenhouse_gas_emissions—cap_and_invest_program.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.065_greenhouse_gas_emissions—cap_and_invest_program.md) for context.

1. Facilities owned or operated by a covered entity must receive an allocation of allowances for the covered emissions at those facilities under this subsection at no cost if the operations of the facility are classified as emissions-intensive and trade-exposed, as determined by being engaged in one or more of the processes described by the following industry descriptions and codes in the North American industry classification system**, as those classifications existed on January 1, 2021**:

    a. Metals manufacturing, including iron and steel making, ferroalloy and primary metals manufacturing, secondary aluminum smelting and alloying, aluminum sheet, plate, and foil manufacturing, and smelting, refining, and alloying of other nonferrous metals, North American industry classification system codes beginning with 331;

    b. Paper manufacturing, including pulp mills, paper mills, and paperboard milling, North American industry classification system codes beginning with 322;

    c. Aerospace product and parts manufacturing, North American industry classification system codes beginning with 3364;

    d. Wood products manufacturing, North American industry classification system codes beginning with 321;

    e. Nonmetallic mineral manufacturing, including glass container manufacturing, North American industry classification system codes beginning with 327;

    f. Chemical manufacturing, North American industry classification system codes beginning with 325;

    k. Asphalt paving mixtures and block manufacturing from refined petroleum, North American industry classification system code 324121;

    l. Asphalt shingle and coating manufacturing from refined petroleum, North American industry classification system code 324122; and

    m. All other petroleum and coal products manufacturing from refined petroleum, North American industry classification system code 324199.

2. By July 1, 2022, the department must adopt by rule objective criteria for both emissions' intensity and trade exposure for the purpose of identifying emissions-intensive, trade-exposed **facilities** during the second compliance period of the program and subsequent compliance periods. A **manufacturing** facility covered by subsection (1)(a) through (m) of this section is considered an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility and is eligible for allocation of no cost allowances as described in this section. In addition, any covered party that **owns or operates a manufacturing facility** that can demonstrate to the department that it meets the objective criteria adopted by rule is also eligible for treatment as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed and is eligible for allocation of no cost allowances as described in this section. In developing the objective criteria under this subsection, the department must consider the locations of facilities potentially identified as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed **facilities** relative to overburdened communities.

3. [Empty]

    a. For the first compliance period beginning in January 1, 2023, the annual allocation of no cost allowances for direct distribution to a facility identified as emissions-intensive and trade-exposed must be equal to the facility's baseline carbon intensity established using data from 2015 through 2019, or other data as allowed under this section, multiplied by the facility's actual production for each calendar year during the compliance period. For facilities using the mass-based approach, the allocation of no cost allowances shall be equal to the facility's mass-based baseline using data from 2015 through 2019, or other data as allowed under this section.

    b. For the second compliance period, beginning in January, 2027, and in each subsequent compliance period, the annual allocation of no cost allowances established in (a) of this subsection shall be adjusted according to the benchmark reduction schedules established in (b)(ii) and (iii) and (e) of this subsection multiplied by the facility's actual production during the period. The department shall adjust the no cost allocation of allowances and credits to an emissions-intensive and trade-exposed facility to avoid duplication with any no cost allowances transferred pursuant to RCW 70A.65.120 and 70A.65.130, if applicable.

        i. For the purpose of this section, "carbon intensity" means the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from a facility in metric tons divided by the facility specific measure of production including, but not limited to, units of product manufactured or sold, over the same time interval.

        ii. If an emissions-intensive and trade-exposed facility is not able to feasibly determine a carbon intensity benchmark based on its unique circumstances, the entity may elect to use a mass-based baseline that does not vary based on changes in production volumes. The mass-based baseline must be based upon data from 2015 through 2019, unless the emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility can demonstrate that there have been abnormal periods of operation that materially impacted the facility and the baseline period should be expanded to include years prior to 2015. For each year during the first four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2023, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 100 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. For each year during the second four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2027, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 97 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. For each year during the third compliance period that begins January 1, 2031, these facilities must be awarded no cost allowances equal to 94 percent of the facility's mass-based baseline. Except as provided in (b)(iii) of this subsection, if a facility elects to use a mass-based baseline, it may not later convert to a carbon intensity benchmark during the first three compliance periods.

        iii. A facility with a North American industry classification system code beginning with 3364 that is utilizing a mass-based baseline in (b)(ii) of this subsection must receive an additional no cost allowance allocation under this section in order to accommodate an increase in production that increases its emissions above the baseline on a basis equivalent in principle to those awarded to entities utilizing a carbon intensity benchmark pursuant to this subsection (3)(b). The department shall establish methods to award, for any annual period, additional no cost allowance allocations under this section and, if appropriate based on projected production, to achieve a similar ongoing result through the adjustment of the facility's mass-based baseline. An eligible facility under this subsection that has elected to use a mass-based baseline may not convert to a carbon intensity benchmark until the next compliance period.

    c. [Empty]

        i. By September 15, 2022, each emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility shall submit its carbon intensity baseline for the first compliance period to the department. The carbon intensity baseline for the first compliance period must use data from 2015-2019, unless the emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility can demonstrate that there have been abnormal periods of operation that materially impacted the facility and the baseline period should be expanded to include years prior to 2015.

        ii. By November 15, 2022, the department shall review and approve each emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility's baseline carbon intensity for the first compliance period.

    d. During the first four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2023, each emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility must record its facility-specific carbon intensity baseline based on its actual production.

    e. [Empty]

        i. For the second four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2027, the second period benchmark for each emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility is three percent below the first period baseline specified in (a), (b), and (c) of this subsection.

        ii. For the third four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2031, the third period benchmark for each emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility is three percent lower than the second period benchmark.

    f. Prior to the beginning of either the second, third, or subsequent compliance periods, **and only after the completion of the report required in subsection (4) of this section,** the department may make an upward adjustment in the next compliance period's benchmark for an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility based on the facility's demonstration to the department that additional reductions in carbon intensity or mass emissions are not technically or economically feasible. The department may base the upward adjustment applicable to an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility in the next compliance period on the facility's best available technology analysis. The department shall by rule provide for **an** emissions-intensive, trade-exposed **facility** to apply to the department for an **upwards** adjustment to the allocation for direct distribution of no cost allowances based on its facility-specific carbon intensity benchmark or mass emissions baseline. The department shall make adjustments based on:

        i. A significant change in the emissions use or emissions attributable to the manufacture of an individual good or goods in this state by an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility based on a finding by the department that an adjustment is necessary to accommodate for changes in the manufacturing process that have a material impact on emissions;

        ii. Significant changes to an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility's external competitive environment that result in a significant increase in leakage risk; or

        iii. Abnormal operating periods when an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility's carbon intensity has been materially affected so that these abnormal operating periods are either excluded or otherwise considered in the establishment of the compliance period carbon intensity benchmarks.

4. [Empty]

    a. By December 1, **2024**, the department shall provide a report to the appropriate committees of the senate and house of representatives that describes alternative methods for determining the amount and a schedule of allowances to be provided to facilities owned or operated by each covered entity designated as an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility from January 1, 2035, through January 1, 2050. **In developing the report, the department must consider, among other relevant information, the criteria in the statement of intent with respect to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries in section 4 of this act.** The report must include a review of global best practices in ensuring against emissions leakage and economic harm to businesses in carbon pricing programs **,** describe alternative methods of emissions performance benchmarking**,** and **describe alternative methods of** mass-based allocation of no cost allowances. At a minimum, the department must evaluate benchmarks based on both carbon intensity and mass, as well as **recommend a process through which an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility may demonstrate its use of best available technology as a method of** compliance. **For each alternative method considered, the report must address any potential impact on the ability of the department to enter into a linkage agreement with another jurisdiction or to remain linked with another jurisdiction.** In developing the report, the department shall form an advisory group that **must include, but is not limited to,** representatives of the manufacturers listed in subsection (1) of this section**, other covered entities, environmental organizations, and technical experts**.

    b. If the legislature does not adopt a compliance obligation for emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facilities by December 1, 2027, those facilities must continue to receive allowances as provided in the third four-year compliance period that begins January 1, 2031.

5. If the actual emissions of an emissions-intensive, trade- exposed facility exceed the facility's no cost allowances assigned for that compliance period, it must acquire additional compliance instruments such that the total compliance instruments transferred to its compliance account consistent with **this** chapter  equals emissions during the compliance period. An emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility must be allowed to bank unused allowances, including for future sale and investment in best available technology when economically feasible. The department shall limit the use of offset credits for compliance by an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility, such that the quantity of no cost allowances plus the provision of offset credits does not exceed 100 percent of the facility's total compliance obligation over a compliance period.

6. The department must withhold or withdraw the relevant share of allowances allocated to a covered entity under this section in the event that the covered entity ceases production in the state and becomes a closed facility. In the event an entity curtails all production and becomes a curtailed facility, the allowances are retained but cannot be traded, sold, or transferred and are still subject to the emission reduction requirements specified in this section. An owner or operator of a curtailed facility may transfer the allowances to a new operator of the facility that will be operated under the same North American industry classification system codes. If the curtailed facility becomes a closed facility, then all unused allowances will be transferred to the emissions containment reserve. A curtailed facility is not eligible to receive free allowances during a period of curtailment. Any allowances withheld or withdrawn under this subsection must be transferred to the emissions containment reserve.

7. An owner or operator of more than one facility receiving no cost allowances under this section may transfer allowances among the eligible facilities.

8. Rules adopted by the department under this section must include protocols for allocating allowances at no cost to an eligible facility built after July 25, 2021. The protocols must include consideration of the products and criteria pollutants being produced by the facility, as well as the local environmental and health impacts associated with the facility. For a facility that is built on tribal lands or is determined by the department to impact tribal lands and resources, the protocols must be developed in consultation with the affected tribal nations.

9. [Empty]

    a. **In order to support the department's ability to perform best available technology analyses as provided in this section, the department may require a person that owns or operates an emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facility in Washington to provide emission and production information to the department, including information related to:**

        i. **The greenhouse gas emissions of facilities, and emissions units within facilities, owned or operated by the person;**

        ii. **The products, and volumes of such products, produced by facilities owned or operated by the person;**

        iii. **The greenhouse gas emissions intensity associated with products produced by facilities owned or operated by the person; and**

        iv. **Information related to the technology and manufacturing processes used by facilities owned or operated by the person.**

    b. **A person that is subject to an order under (a) of this subsection must provide the requested information within a reasonable period of time as specified by the department, after receipt of the department's order.**

    c. **A person that submits information or records to the department under this subsection may request that the information or records be made available only for the confidential use of the department, the director, or the appropriate division of the department. The director shall give consideration to the request and if this action is not detrimental to the public interest and is otherwise in accordance with the policies and purposes of chapter 43.21A RCW, the director may grant the request, in whole or in part, for the information to remain confidential as authorized in RCW 43.21A.160.**

## Section 4
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [70A.65](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.065_greenhouse_gas_emissions—cap_and_invest_program.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.065_greenhouse_gas_emissions—cap_and_invest_program.md) for context.

1. This section constitutes a statement of legislative intent with respect to amending, at a future date, the allocation of allowances to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facilities under RCW 70A.65.110. Nothing in this section may be construed to establish, amend, or eliminate a right, duty, or compliance obligation or other obligation under this chapter or any other state law.

2. It is the intent of the legislature, in establishing a policy applicable to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facilities, to:

    a. Ensure that emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries achieve their proportionate share of the state's emissions limits established in RCW 70A.45.020 and avoid leakage of emissions and jobs;

    b. Reduce criteria air pollution and environmental health disparities, particularly in overburdened communities as defined in chapter 70A.02 RCW; and

    c. Synchronize Washington's policy for reducing industrial emissions with carbon border adjustment mechanisms as they are adopted by other jurisdictions that have enacted a carbon price, in a manner consistent with international trade law and the United States Constitution.

3. It is the intent of the legislature, upon establishing a permanent policy applicable to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facilities, to:

    a. Transition industrial boilers used in manufacturing to nonemitting technology, with a prioritization of transitioning:

        i. Boilers that burn coal or oil, followed by boilers that burn gas;

        ii. Boilers that are less energy-efficient or emissions-efficient over boilers that are comparatively more efficient; and

        iii. Larger boilers over smaller boilers;

    b. Transition industrial technologies that require temperatures that cannot be produced by electricity to renewable natural gas, renewable hydrogen, or other lower-emissions technologies;

    c. Maximize the use of building materials produced using versions of lower-emissions manufacturing processes, such as:

        i. Lower-emissions steel as compared to other forms of steel, prioritizing: (A) Recycled steel, followed by lower-emissions steel produced using renewable hydrogen or molten oxide electrolysis; and (B) to phase out the use of steel produced in a blast furnace; and

        ii. Low-clinker cement as compared to other forms of cement;

    d. Encourage recycling of emissions-intensive or energy-intensive products, including steel, aluminum, plastic, concrete, textiles, glass, and paper, where such recycling is less emissions-intensive from a life-cycle perspective than using nonrecycled manufacturing inputs; and

    e. Implement carbon capture and sequestration for the most difficult to decarbonize industrial processes, including cement production.

4. It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that, just as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed facilities are given special consideration under this chapter due to their unique competitive environment and emissions portfolios, the compliance obligations of district energy facilities with emissions-intensive processes and unique commercial characteristics be established with special consideration given to the competitive market environment in which such facilities operate and the particular aspects of their emissions portfolios and potential for emission reductions or emission rate reductions to be achieved at such facilities.


## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [70A.65.010](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.065_greenhouse_gas_emissions—cap_and_invest_program.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.065_greenhouse_gas_emissions—cap_and_invest_program.md) for context.

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Allowance" means an authorization to emit up to one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

2. "Allowance price containment reserve" means an account maintained by the department with allowances available for sale through separate reserve auctions at predefined prices to assist in containing compliance costs for covered and opt-in entities in the event of unanticipated high costs for compliance instruments.

3. "Annual allowance budget" means the total number of greenhouse gas allowances allocated for auction and distribution for one calendar year by the department.

4. "Asset controlling supplier" means any entity that owns or operates interconnected electricity generating facilities or serves as an exclusive marketer for these facilities even though it does not own them, and has been designated by the department and received a department-published emissions factor for the wholesale electricity procured from its system. The department shall use a methodology consistent with the methodology used by an external greenhouse gas emissions trading program that shares the regional electricity transmission system. Electricity from an asset controlling supplier is considered a specified source of electricity.

5. "Auction" means the process of selling greenhouse gas allowances by offering them up for bid, taking bids, and then distributing the allowances to winning bidders.

6. "Auction floor price" means a price for allowances below which bids at auction are not eligible to be accepted.

7. "Auction purchase limit" means the limit on the number of allowances one registered entity or a group of affiliated registered entities may purchase from the share of allowances sold at an auction.

8. "Balancing authority" means the responsible entity that integrates resource plans ahead of time, maintains load-interchange-generation balance within a balancing authority area, and supports interconnection frequency in real time.

9. "Balancing authority area" means the collection of generation, transmission, and load within the metered boundaries of a balancing authority. A balancing authority maintains load-resource balance within this area.

10. "Best available technology" means a technology or technologies that will achieve the greatest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, taking into account the fuels, processes, and equipment used by facilities to produce goods of comparable type, quantity, and quality. Best available technology must be technically feasible, commercially available, economically viable, not create excessive environmental impacts, and be compliant with all applicable laws while not changing the characteristics of the good being manufactured.

11. "Biomass" means nonfossilized and biodegradable organic material originating from plants, animals, and microorganisms, including products, by-products, residues, and waste from agriculture, forestry, and related industries as well as the nonfossilized and biodegradable organic fractions of industrial waste, including gases and liquids recovered from the decomposition of nonfossilized and biodegradable organic material.

12. "Biomass-derived fuels," "biomass fuels," or "biofuels" means fuels derived from biomass that have at least 40 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions based on a full life-cycle analysis when compared to petroleum fuels for which biofuels are capable as serving as a substitute.

13. "Carbon dioxide equivalents" means a measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential.

14. "Carbon dioxide removal" means deliberate human activities removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products.

4. When a covered entity reports, during a compliance period, emissions from a facility under RCW 70A.15.2200 that are below the thresholds specified in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, the covered entity continues to have a compliance obligation through the current compliance period. When a covered entity reports emissions below the threshold for each year during an entire compliance period, or has ceased all processes at the facility requiring reporting under RCW 70A.15.2200, the entity is no longer a covered entity as of the beginning of the subsequent compliance period unless the department provides notice at least 12 months before the end of the compliance period that the facility's emissions were within 10 percent of the threshold and that the person will continue to be designated as a covered entity in order to ensure equity among all covered entities. Whenever a covered entity ceases to be a covered entity, the department shall notify the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature of the name of the entity and the reason the entity is no longer a covered entity.

5. For types of emission sources described in subsection (1) of this section that begin or modify operation after January 1, 2023, and types of emission sources described in subsection (2) of this section that begin or modify operation after 2027, coverage under the program starts in the calendar year in which emissions from the source exceed the applicable thresholds in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, or upon formal notice from the department that the source is expected to exceed the applicable emissions threshold, whichever happens first. Sources meeting these conditions are required to transfer their first allowances on the first transfer deadline of the year following the year in which their emissions were equal to or exceeded the emissions threshold.

6. For emission sources described in subsection (1) of this section that are in operation or otherwise active between 2015 and 2019 but were not required to report emissions for those years under RCW 70A.15.2200 for the reporting periods between 2015 and 2019, coverage under the program starts in the calendar year following the year in which emissions from the source exceed the applicable thresholds in subsection (1) of this section as reported pursuant to RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter, or upon formal notice from the department that the source is expected to exceed the applicable emissions threshold for the first year that source is required to report emissions, whichever happens first. Sources meeting these criteria are required to transfer their first allowances on the first transfer deadline of the year following the year in which their emissions, as reported under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter, were equal to or exceeded the emissions threshold.

7. The following emissions are exempt from coverage in the program, regardless of the emissions reported under RCW 70A.15.2200 or provided as required by this chapter:

    a. Emissions from the combustion of aviation fuels;

    b. Emissions from watercraft fuels supplied in Washington that are combusted outside of Washington;

        i. Motor vehicle fuel or special fuel that is used exclusively for agricultural purposes by a farm fuel user. This exemption is available only if a buyer of motor vehicle fuel or special fuel provides the seller with an exemption certificate in a form and manner prescribed by the department. For the purposes of this subsection, "agricultural purposes" and "farm fuel user" have the same meanings as provided in RCW 82.08.865.

        ii. The department must determine a method for expanding the exemption provided under (e)(i) of this subsection to include fuels used for the purpose of transporting agricultural products on public highways. The department must maintain this expanded exemption for a period of five years, in order to provide the agricultural sector with a feasible transition period; and

    f. Emissions from facilities with North American industry classification system code 92811 (national security).

8. The department shall not require multiple covered entities to have a compliance obligation for the same emissions. The department may by rule authorize refineries, fuel suppliers, facilities using natural gas, and natural gas utilities to provide by agreement for the assumption of the compliance obligation for fuel or natural gas supplied and combusted in the state. The department must be notified of such an agreement at least 12 months prior to the compliance obligation period for which the agreement is applicable.

9. [Empty]

    a. The legislature intends to promote a growing and sustainable economy and to avoid leakage of emissions from manufacturing to other locations. The legislature further intends to see innovative new businesses locate and grow in Washington that contribute to Washington's prosperity and environmental objectives.

    b. Consistent with the intent of the legislature to avoid the leakage of emissions to other jurisdictions, in achieving the state's greenhouse gas limits in RCW 70A.45.020, the state, including lead agencies under chapter 43.21C RCW, shall pursue the limits in a manner that recognizes that the siting and placement of new or expanded best-in-class facilities with lower carbon emitting processes is in the economic and environmental interests of the state of Washington.

    c. In conducting a life-cycle analysis, if required, for new or expanded facilities that require review under chapter 43.21C RCW, a lead agency must evaluate and attribute any potential net cumulative greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the project as compared to other existing facilities or best available technology including best-in-class facilities and emerging lower carbon processes that supply the same product or end use. The department may adopt rules to determine the appropriate threshold for applying this analysis.

    d. Covered emissions from an entity that is or will be a covered entity under this chapter may not be the basis for denial of a permit for a new or expanded facility. Covered emissions must be included in the analysis undertaken pursuant to (c) of this subsection. Nothing in this subsection requires a lead agency or a permitting agency to approve or issue a permit to a permit applicant, including to a new or expanded fossil fuel project.

    e. A lead agency under chapter 43.21C RCW or a permitting agency shall allow a new or expanded facility that is a covered entity or opt-in entity to satisfy a mitigation requirement for its covered emissions under **this** chapter  and under any greenhouse gas emission mitigation requirements for covered emissions under chapter 43.21C RCW by submitting to the department the number of compliance instruments equivalent to its covered emissions during a compliance period.
