## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that Washington state residents want to act affirmatively for the support and promotion of the labor rights of workers, and protections against the exploitation of child labor, as it pertains to the sourcing of transportation fuels. In an attempt to remedy historic labor practices that enlisted children in dangerous work at a young age, including in the fuel production sector, federal agencies and laws prohibit the labor of minors from the age of five to 14 in most instances, and restrict the types of especially dangerous work that may be performed by minors between the ages of 14 and 18. These basic child labor protections do not exist in all countries from which Washington has historically sourced fuels.

2. The legislature recognizes that Washington state is not a crude oil producer and produces very limited supplies of low carbon alternative fuel stocks. However, Washington is a major crude oil refining center with the fifth largest refining capacity of any state in the United States.

3. Consistent with certain fundamental rights of self-determination, Washington residents wish to assure themselves that the dollars they spend as consumers of transportation fuel in the domestic fuel market are consistent with their core values. Additionally, Washington residents wish to impact positive change in labor standards by requiring that all transportation fuels that serve the domestic Washington market are extracted and produced in ways that respect basic labor rights, including prohibiting child labor in the sourcing of transportation fuel.
