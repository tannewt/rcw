1. Any person who, without compensation or the expectation of compensation, renders nonmedical care or assistance at the scene of an emergency or disaster shall not be liable for civil damages resulting from any act or omission in the rendering of such care or assistance other than acts or omissions constituting gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct.

    b. "Emergency or disaster" means an event or set of circumstances that:

        i. Demands immediate action to preserve public health, protect life, protect public property, or to provide relief to any stricken community overtaken by such occurrence; or
