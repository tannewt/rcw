## Section 1
In addition to the other indicators that apply under the healthy Washington: Roadmap to recovery plan, the department of health shall monitor the status of each county on a weekly basis with respect to its COVID-19 vaccine dose allocation to determine whether each county is receiving an equitable share of COVID-19 vaccine doses in proportion to the state's allocation. If the department of health determines that a county is in danger of being reverted to a more restrictive phase, the department shall immediately adjust the vaccine dose allocation to ensure that the county will receive an allocation of COVID-19 vaccine doses that does not fall below the statewide average allocation for counties. A county that has not received an equitable share of COVID-19 vaccine doses in proportion to the state's allocation may not be reverted to a more restrictive phase.
