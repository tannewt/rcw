The role of the crime victim advocate is to provide emotional support to the crime victim;

    k. With respect to victims and survivors of victims, to be physically present in court during trial, or if subpoenaed to testify, to be scheduled as early as practical in the proceedings in order to be physically present during trial after testifying and not to be excluded solely because they have testified;

2. **If a victim, survivor of a victim, or witness of a crime is denied a right enumerated in this section, he or she may seek an order directing compliance by the relevant party or parties by filing a petition in the superior court in the county in which the crime occurred and providing notice of such petition to the relevant party or parties.
