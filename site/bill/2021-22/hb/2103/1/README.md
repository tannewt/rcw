5. **It is the express public policy of this state that no person be allowed to profit through contracts tainted by commercial bribery. Victims of such conduct shall be entitled to full civil tort remedies, with proof of such conduct made by a preponderance of the evidence. No contract may be enforced in favor of a person who participated in commercial bribery in connection with the contract, and no civil judgment in this state may be enforced in favor of a person who was found to have committed commercial bribery if the judgment was based on a contract tainted by commercial bribery. Any such judgment shall be deemed void as against public policy. This provision shall be retroactive to such contracts for a period of 10 years.**
