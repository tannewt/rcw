## Section 1
In 2021, the state enacted House Bill No. 1016 to declare Juneteenth a state legal holiday. The legislature finds that there is ambiguity about whether Juneteenth is also a school holiday as a result of that act. The legislature intends to clarify that Juneteenth, like all other state legal holidays, is a school holiday on which school may not be taught.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [28A.150.050](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.150_general_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.150_general_provisions.md) for context.

1. **All of the state legal holidays set forth in RCW 1.16.050(1) are also** school holidays and school may not be taught on these days

.

2. No reduction from a teacher's time or salary may be made by reason of the fact that a school day happens to be one of the days referred to in this section as a day on which school is not taught.
