# House Bill 1108

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1108.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that whether mediation, reporting, and payment provisions of the foreclosure fairness act apply to any particular beneficiary in a given year is tied to the number of trustee's sales and number of notices of trustee's sale recorded in the preceding year. The legislature further finds that, due to the federal foreclosure moratorium in place from at least March of 2020 through December of 2020, it is likely that, absent legislative action, the mediation, reporting, and payment provisions of the foreclosure fairness act will apply to very few if any beneficiaries in calendar year 2021 because the threshold numbers that trigger application of these provisions will not be met. The legislature therefore intends to put in place a temporary stopgap remedy so that vital assistance provisions of the foreclosure fairness act are not lost during 2021 at the very time that foreclosure activity is likely to be increasing.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [61.24.166](/rcw/61_mortgages_deeds_of_trust_and_real_estate_contracts/61.24_deeds_of_trust.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/61_mortgages_deeds_of_trust_and_real_estate_contracts/61.24_deeds_of_trust.md) for context.

## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [61.24.173](/rcw/61_mortgages_deeds_of_trust_and_real_estate_contracts/61.24_deeds_of_trust.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/61_mortgages_deeds_of_trust_and_real_estate_contracts/61.24_deeds_of_trust.md) for context.

1. Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, beginning July 1, 2016, and every quarter thereafter, every beneficiary on whose behalf a notice of trustee's sale has been recorded pursuant to RCW 61.24.040 on residential real property under this chapter must:

    a. Report to the department the number of notices of trustee's sale recorded for each residential property during the previous quarter;

    b. Remit the amount required under subsection (2) of this section; and

    c. Report and update beneficiary contact information for the person and work group responsible for the beneficiary's compliance with the requirements of the foreclosure fairness act created in this chapter.

2. For each notice of trustee's sale recorded on residential real property, the beneficiary on whose behalf the notice of trustee's sale has been recorded shall remit **$325** to the department to be deposited, as provided under RCW 61.24.172, into the foreclosure fairness account. The **$325** payment is required for every recorded notice of trustee's sale for noncommercial loans on residential real property, but does not apply to the recording of an amended notice of trustee's sale. No later than January 1, 2020, the department may from time to time adjust the amount of the fee, not to exceed **$325**, at a sufficient level to defray the costs of the program. The beneficiary shall remit the total amount required in a lump sum each quarter.

3. Any adjustment to the amount of the fee, pursuant to the authority of subsection (2) of this section, shall be made by rule adopted by the department in accordance with the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW.

4. Reporting and payments under subsections (1) and (2) of this section are due within **45** days of the end of each quarter.

5. (a) **Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, this** section does not apply to any beneficiary or loan servicer that is a federally insured depository institution, as defined in 12 U.S.C. Sec. 461(b)(1)(A), and that certifies under penalty of perjury that fewer than **50** notices of trustee's sale were recorded on its behalf in the preceding year.

    b. **During the 2021 calendar year only, this section does not apply to any beneficiary or loan servicer that is a federally insured depository institution, as defined in 12 U.S.C. Sec. 461(b)(1)(A), and that certifies under penalty of perjury that fewer than 50 notices of trustee's sale were recorded on its behalf in 2019.**

6. This section does not apply to association beneficiaries subject to chapter 64.32, 64.34, or 64.38 RCW.

7. For purposes of this section, "residential real property" includes residential real property with up to four dwelling units, whether or not the property or any part thereof is owner-occupied.
