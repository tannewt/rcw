# Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1113 - Session Law Chapter 119 Year 2021 as Recommended by Education

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1113-S.SL.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature acknowledges that student absences from school can be an indicator that the academic and social-emotional needs of the students are not being met in the public school or classroom or through the school culture or climate. Student absences can also signal to educators that families may need additional information and assistance in supporting student learning within the home.

2. The legislature finds that as research and public awareness grows about the impact of school climate and culture on the academic and social-emotional experiences of students, the systems of public education must shift away from enforcing punitive, compliance-focused policies and toward enabling constructive, student-centered practices. The legislature further finds that a student-centered system of public education serves the individual needs of students with strong family engagement and through integrated supports provided by the state, public schools, and the greater community.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to refocus the attendance policies and practices of the public education system to emphasize individualized student and family supports that are culturally responsive, evidence-informed, and show promising practice for integrating multiple systems of support to effectively improve consistent student attendance at school and family engagement in student learning.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [28A.225](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall develop and publish best practice guidance to eliminate or reduce student absences and to otherwise implement the requirements of this chapter. The guidance must focus on student and family engagement, be based in restorative justice practices, and emphasize integration of student and family support systems. The guidance must be developed in consultation with the educational opportunity gap oversight and accountability committee and updated periodically.


## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [28A.225](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

The superintendent of public instruction may adopt rules necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.015](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. If a parent enrolls a child who is six or seven years of age in a public school, the child is required to attend and that parent has the responsibility to ensure the child attends for the full time that school is in session. An exception shall be made to this requirement for children whose parents formally remove them from enrollment if the child is less than eight years old and a petition has not been filed against the parent under subsection (3) of this section. The requirement to attend school under this subsection does not apply to a child enrolled in a public school part-time for the purpose of receiving ancillary services. A child required to attend school under this subsection may be temporarily excused upon the request of his or her parent for purposes agreed upon by the school district and parent.

2. If a six or seven year old child is required to attend public school under subsection (1) of this section and that child has unexcused absences, the public school in which the child is enrolled shall:

    a. Inform the child's custodial parent, parents, or guardian by a notice in writing or by telephone whenever the child has failed to attend school after one unexcused absence within any month during the current school year;

    b. Request a conference or conferences with the custodial parent, parents, or guardian and child at a time reasonably convenient for all persons included for the purpose of analyzing the causes of the child's absences after three unexcused absences within any month during the current school year. If a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference day is to take place within thirty days of the third unexcused absence, then the school district may schedule this conference on that day; and

    c. Take steps to eliminate or reduce the child's absences. These steps shall include, where appropriate, adjusting the child's school program or school or course assignment, providing more individualized or remedial instruction, offering assistance in enrolling the child in available alternative schools or programs, or assisting the parent or child to obtain supplementary services that may help eliminate or ameliorate the cause or causes for the absence from school.

3. If a child **is** required to attend public school under subsection (1) of this section **, after the child's seventh unexcused absence within any month during the current school year and not later than the 15th** unexcused absence**during the current** school year, the school district shall file a petition for civil action as provided in RCW 28A.225.035 against the parent of the child.

4. This section does not require a six or seven year old child to enroll in a public or private school or to receive home-based instruction. This section only applies to six or seven year old children whose parents enroll them full time in public school and do not formally remove them from enrollment as provided in subsection (1) of this section.


## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.030](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

If a child under the age of seventeen is required to attend school under RCW 28A.225.010 and if the actions taken by a school district under RCW 28A.225.020 are not successful in substantially reducing an enrolled student's absences from public school, **after the child's** seventh unexcused absence  within any month during the current school year **and** not later than the **15th** unexcused absence during the current school year the school district shall file a petition and supporting affidavit for a civil action with the juvenile court alleging a violation of RCW 28A.225.010: (a) By the parent; (b) by the child; or (c) by the parent and the child. The petition must include a list of all interventions that have been attempted as set forth in RCW 28A.225.020, include a copy of any previous truancy assessment completed by the child's current school district, the history of approved best practices intervention or research-based intervention previously provided to the child by the child's current school district, and a copy of the most recent truancy information document provided to the parent, pursuant to RCW 28A.225.005. Except as provided in this subsection, no additional documents need be filed with the petition. Nothing in this subsection requires court jurisdiction to terminate when a child turns seventeen or precludes a school district from filing a petition for a child that is seventeen years of age.

2. The district shall not later than the **seventh** unexcused absence in a month:

    a. Enter into an agreement with a student and parent that establishes school attendance requirements;

    b. Refer a student to a community truancy board as defined in RCW 28A.225.025. The community truancy board shall enter into an agreement with the student and parent that establishes school attendance requirements and take other appropriate actions to reduce the child's absences; or

    c. File a petition under subsection (1) of this section.

1. As required under subsection (2) of this section, the office of superintendent of public instruction shall collect and school districts shall submit student-level truancy data in order to allow a better understanding of actions taken under RCW 28A.225.030. The office shall prepare an annual report to the legislature by December 15th of each year.

2. The reports under subsection (1) of this section shall include, disaggregated by student group:

    a. The number of enrolled students and the number of unexcused absences;

4. The K-12 data governance group shall develop the data protocols and guidance for school districts in the collection of data to provide a clearer understanding of actions taken under RCW 28A.225.030.


## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.030](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. If a child under the age of seventeen is required to attend school under RCW 28A.225.010 and if the actions taken by a school district under RCW 28A.225.020 are not successful in substantially reducing an enrolled student's absences from public school, **after the child's seventh** unexcused absence  within any month during the current school year **and** not later than the **15th** unexcused absence during the current school year the school district shall file a petition and supporting affidavit for a civil action with the juvenile court alleging a violation of RCW 28A.225.010: (a) By the parent; (b) by the child; or (c) by the parent and the child.

2. The reports under subsection (1) of this section shall include, disaggregated by student group:

    a. The number of enrolled students and the number of unexcused absences;

    b. The number of enrolled students with **15** or more unexcused absences in a school year or **seven** or more unexcused absences in a month during a school year;

## Section 9
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.020](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. If a child required to attend school under RCW 28A.225.010 fails to attend school without valid justification, the public school in which the child is enrolled shall:

    a. Inform the child's parent by a notice in writing or by telephone whenever the child has failed to attend school after one unexcused absence within any month during the current school year. School officials shall inform the parent of the potential consequences of additional unexcused absences. If the parent is not fluent in English, the school must make reasonable efforts to provide this information in a language in which the parent is fluent;

    b. Schedule a conference or conferences with the parent and child at a time reasonably convenient for all persons included for the purpose of analyzing the causes of the child's absences after three unexcused absences within any month during the current school year. If a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference day is to take place within thirty days of the third unexcused absence, then the school district may schedule this conference on that day. If the child's parent does not attend the scheduled conference, the conference may be conducted with the student and school official. However the parent shall be notified of the steps to be taken to eliminate or reduce the child's absence; and

    c. At some point after the second and before the **seventh** unexcused absence, take data-informed steps to eliminate or reduce the child's absences.

        i. In middle school and high school, these steps must include application of the Washington assessment of the risks and needs of students (WARNS) or other assessment by a school district's designee under RCW 28A.225.026.

        ii. For any child with an existing individualized education plan or 504 plan, these steps must include the convening of the child's individualized education plan or 504 plan team, including a behavior specialist or mental health specialist where appropriate, to consider the reasons for the absences. If necessary, and if consent from the parent is given, a functional behavior assessment to explore the function of the absence behavior shall be conducted and a detailed behavior plan completed. Time should be allowed for the behavior plan to be initiated and data tracked to determine progress.

        iii. With respect to any child, without an existing individualized education plan or 504 plan, reasonably believed to have a mental or physical disability or impairment, these steps must include informing the child's parent of the right to obtain an appropriate evaluation at no cost to the parent to determine whether the child has a disability or impairment and needs accommodations, related services, or special education services. This includes children with suspected emotional or behavioral disabilities as defined in WAC 392-172A-01035. If the school obtains consent to conduct an evaluation, time should be allowed for the evaluation to be completed, and if the child is found to be eligible for special education services, accommodations, or related services, a plan developed to address the child's needs.

        iv. These steps must include, where appropriate, providing an available approved best practice or research-based intervention, or both, consistent with the WARNS profile or other assessment, if an assessment was applied, adjusting the child's school program or school or course assignment, providing more individualized or remedial instruction, providing appropriate vocational courses or work experience, referring the child to a community **engagement** board, requiring the child to attend an alternative school or program, or assisting the parent or child to obtain supplementary services that might eliminate or ameliorate the cause or causes for the absence from school.

2. For purposes of this chapter, an "unexcused absence" means that a child:

    a. [Empty]

        i. Has failed to attend the majority of hours or periods in an average school day or has failed to comply with a more restrictive school district policy; and

        ii. Has failed to meet the school district's policy for excused absences; or

    b. Has failed to comply with alternative learning experience program attendance requirements as described by the superintendent of public instruction.

3. If a child transfers from one school district to another during the school year, the receiving school or school district shall include the unexcused absences accumulated at the previous school or from the previous school district for purposes of this section, RCW 28A.225.030, and 28A.225.015. The sending school district shall provide this information to the receiving school, together with a copy of any previous assessment as required under subsection (1)(c) of this section, history of any best practices or researched-based intervention previously provided to the child by the child's sending school district, and a copy of the most recent truancy information including any online or written acknowledgment by the parent and child, as provided for in RCW 28A.225.005. All school districts must use the standard choice transfer form for releasing a student to a nonresident school district for the purposes of accessing an alternative learning experience program.


## Section 10
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.025](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. For purposes of this chapter, "community **engagement** board" means a board established pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between a juvenile court and a school district and composed of members of the local community in which the child attends school. Community **engagement** boards must include members who receive training regarding the identification of barriers to school attendance, the use of the Washington assessment of the risks and needs of students (WARNS) or other assessment tools to identify the specific needs of individual children, cultural responsive interactions, trauma-informed approaches to discipline, evidence-based treatments that have been found effective in supporting at-risk youth and their families, and the specific services and treatment available in the particular school, court, community, and elsewhere. Duties of a community **engagement** board shall include, but not be limited to: Identifying barriers to school attendance, recommending methods for improving attendance such as connecting students and their families with community services, culturally appropriate promising practices, and evidence-based services such as functional family therapy, suggesting to the school district that the child enroll in another school, an alternative education program, an education center, a skill center, a dropout prevention program, or another public or private educational program, or recommending to the juvenile court that a juvenile be offered the opportunity for placement in a HOPE center or crisis residential center, if appropriate.

2. The legislature finds that utilization of community **engagement** boards is the preferred means of intervention when preliminary methods to eliminate or reduce unexcused absences as required by RCW 28A.225.020 have not been effective in securing the child's attendance at school. The legislature intends to encourage and support the development and expansion of community **engagement** boards. Operation of a school truancy board does not excuse a district from the obligation of filing a petition within the requirements of RCW 28A.225.015(3).


## Section 11
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.026](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. By the beginning of the 2017-18 school year, juvenile courts must establish, through a memorandum of understanding with each school district within their respective counties, a coordinated and collaborative approach to address truancy through the establishment of a community **engagement** board or, with respect to certain small districts, through other means as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

2. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, each school district must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court in the county in which it is located with respect to the operation of a community **engagement** board. A community **engagement** board may be operated by a juvenile court, a school district, or a collaboration between both entities, so long as the agreement is memorialized in a memorandum of understanding. For a school district that is located in more than one county, the memorandum of understanding shall be with the juvenile court in the county that acts as the school district's treasurer.

3. A school district with fewer than three hundred students must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court in the county in which it is located with respect to: (a) The operation of a community **engagement** board; or (b) addressing truancy through other coordinated means of intervention aimed at identifying barriers to school attendance, and connecting students and their families with community services, culturally appropriate promising practices, and evidence-based services such as functional family therapy. School districts with fewer than three hundred students may work cooperatively with other school districts or the school district's educational service district to ensure access to a community **engagement** board or to provide other coordinated means of intervention.

4. All school districts must designate, and identify to the local juvenile court and to the office of the superintendent of public instruction, a person or persons to coordinate school district efforts to address excessive absenteeism and truancy, including tasks associated with: Outreach and conferences pursuant to RCW 28A.225.018; entering into a memorandum of understanding with the juvenile court; establishing protocols and procedures with the court; coordinating trainings; sharing evidence-based and culturally appropriate promising practices; identifying a person within every school to serve as a contact with respect to excessive absenteeism and truancy; and assisting in the recruitment of community **engagement** board members.

5. As has been demonstrated by school districts and county juvenile courts around the state that have worked together and led the way with community **engagement** boards, success has resulted from involving the entire community and leveraging existing dollars from a variety of sources, including public and private, local and state, and court, school, and community. In emulating this coordinated and collaborative approach statewide pursuant to local memoranda of understanding, courts and school districts are encouraged to create strong community-wide partnerships and to leverage existing dollars and resources.


## Section 12
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.0261](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. By requiring an initial stay of truancy petitions for diversion to community **engagement** boards, the legislature intends to achieve the following outcomes:

    a. Increased access to community **engagement** boards and other truancy early intervention programs for parents and children throughout the state;

    b. Increased quantity and quality of truancy intervention and prevention efforts in the community;

    c. A reduction in the number of truancy petitions that result in further proceedings by juvenile courts, other than dismissal of the petition, after the initial stay and diversion to a community **engagement** board;

    d. A reduction in the number of truancy petitions that result in a civil contempt proceeding or detention order; and

    e. Increased school attendance.

2. No later than January 1, 2021, the Washington state institute for public policy is directed to evaluate the effectiveness of chapter 205, Laws of 2016. An initial report scoping of the methodology to be used to review chapter 205, Laws of 2016 shall be submitted to the fiscal committees of the legislature by January 1, 2018. The initial report must identify any data gaps that could hinder the ability of the institute to conduct its review.


## Section 13
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.027](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. Subject to funds appropriated for this purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall allocate to community **engagement** boards grant funds that may be used to supplement existing funds in order to pay for training for board members or the provision of services and treatment to children and their families.

2. The superintendent of public instruction must select grant recipients based on the criteria in this section. This is a competitive grant process. A prerequisite to applying for either or both grants is a memoranda of understanding, between a school district and a court, to institute a new or maintain an existing community **engagement** board that meets the requirements of RCW 28A.225.025.

3. Successful applicants for an award of grant funds to supplement existing funds to pay for the training of community **engagement** board members must commit to the provision of training to board members regarding the identification of barriers to school attendance, the use of the Washington assessment of the risks and needs of students (WARNS) or other assessment tools to identify the specific needs of individual children, trauma-informed approaches to discipline, research about adverse childhood experiences, evidence-based treatments and culturally appropriate promising practices, as well as the specific academic and community services and treatments available in the school, court, community, and elsewhere. This training may be provided by educational service districts.

4. Successful applicants for an award of grant funds to supplement existing funds to pay for services and treatments provided to children and their families must commit to the provision of academic services such as tutoring, credit retrieval and school reengagement supports, community services, and evidence-based treatments that have been found to be effective in supporting at-risk youth and their families, such as functional family therapy, or those that have been shown to be culturally appropriate promising practices.


## Section 14
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.035](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. A petition for a civil action under RCW 28A.225.030 or 28A.225.015 shall consist of a written notification to the court alleging that:

    a. The child has unexcused absences as described in RCW 28A.225.030(1) during the current school year;

    b. Actions taken by the school district have not been successful in substantially reducing the child's absences from school; and

    c. Court intervention and supervision are necessary to assist the school district or parent to reduce the child's absences from school.

2. The petition shall set forth the name, date of birth, school, address, gender, race, and ethnicity of the child and the names and addresses of the child's parents, and shall set forth the languages in which the child and parent are fluent, whether there is an existing individualized education program, and the child's current academic status in school.

3. The petition shall set forth facts that support the allegations in this section and shall generally request relief available under this chapter and provide information about what the court might order under RCW 28A.225.090.

4. [Empty]

    a. When a petition is filed under RCW 28A.225.030 or 28A.225.015, it shall initially be stayed by the juvenile court, and the child and the child's parent must be referred to a community **engagement** board or other coordinated means of intervention as set forth in the memorandum of understanding under RCW 28A.225.026. The community **engagement** board must provide to the court a description of the intervention and prevention efforts to be employed to substantially reduce the child's unexcused absences, along with a timeline for completion.

    b. If a community **engagement** board or other coordinated means of intervention is not in place as required by RCW 28A.225.026, the juvenile court shall schedule a hearing at which the court shall consider the petition.

5. When a referral is made to a community **engagement** board, the **community engagement** board must meet with the child, a parent, and the school district representative and enter into an agreement with the petitioner and respondent regarding expectations and any actions necessary to address the child's truancy within twenty days of the referral. If the petition is based on RCW 28A.225.015, the child shall not be required to attend and the agreement under this subsection shall be between the **community engagement** board, the school district, and the child's parent. The court may permit the **community engagement** board or truancy prevention counselor to provide continued supervision over the student, or parent if the petition is based on RCW 28A.225.015.

6. If the community **engagement** board fails to reach an agreement, or the parent or student does not comply with the agreement within the timeline for completion set by the community **engagement** board, the community **engagement** board shall return the case to the juvenile court. The stay of the petition shall be lifted, and the juvenile court shall schedule a hearing at which the court shall consider the petition.

7. [Empty]

    a. Notwithstanding the provisions in subsection (4)(a) of this section, a hearing shall not be required if other actions by the court would substantially reduce the child's unexcused absences. Such actions may include referral to an existing community **engagement** board, use of the Washington assessment of risks and needs of students (WARNS) or other assessment tools to identify the specific needs of individual children, the provision of community-based services, and the provision of evidence-based treatments that have been found to be effective in supporting at-risk youth and their families. When a juvenile court hearing is held, the court shall:

        i. Separately notify the child, the parent of the child, and the school district of the hearing. If the parent is not fluent in English, notice should be provided in a language in which the parent is fluent as indicated on the petition pursuant to RCW 28A.225.030(1);

        ii. Notify the parent and the child of their rights to present evidence at the hearing; and

        iii. Notify the parent and the child of the options and rights available under chapter 13.32A RCW.

    b. If the child is not provided with counsel, the advisement of rights must take place in court by means of a colloquy between the court, the child if eight years old or older, and the parent.

8. [Empty]

    a. The court may require the attendance of the child if eight years old or older, the parents, and the school district at any hearing on a petition filed under RCW 28A.225.030.

    b. The court may not issue a bench warrant for a child for failure to appear at a hearing on an initial truancy petition filed under RCW 28A.225.030. If there has been proper service, the court may instead enter a default order assuming jurisdiction under the terms specified in subsection (12) of this section.

9. A school district is responsible for determining who shall represent the school district at hearings on a petition filed under RCW 28A.225.030 or 28A.225.015.

10. The court may permit the first hearing to be held without requiring that either party be represented by legal counsel, and to be held without a guardian ad litem for the child under RCW 4.08.050. At the request of the school district, the court shall permit a school district representative who is not an attorney to represent the school district at any future hearings.

11. If the child is in a special education program or has a diagnosed mental or emotional disorder, the court shall inquire as to what efforts the school district has made to assist the child in attending school.

12. If the allegations in the petition are established by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall grant the petition and enter an order assuming jurisdiction to intervene for the period of time determined by the court, after considering the facts alleged in the petition and the circumstances of the juvenile, to most likely cause the juvenile to return to and remain in school while the juvenile is subject to this chapter. In no case may the order expire before the end of the school year in which it is entered.

13. [Empty]

    a. If the court assumes jurisdiction, the school district shall periodically report to the court any additional unexcused absences by the child, actions taken by the school district, and an update on the child's academic status in school at a schedule specified by the court.

    b. The first report under this subsection (13) must be received no later than three months from the date that the court assumes jurisdiction.

14. Community **engagement** boards and the courts shall coordinate, to the extent possible, proceedings and actions pertaining to children who are subject to truancy petitions and at-risk youth petitions in RCW 13.32A.191 or child in need of services petitions in RCW 13.32A.140.

15. If after a juvenile court assumes jurisdiction in one county the child relocates to another county, the juvenile court in the receiving county shall, upon the request of a school district or parent, assume jurisdiction of the petition filed in the previous county.


## Section 15
> This section modifies existing section [28A.225.090](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.225_compulsory_school_attendance_and_admission.md) for context.

1. A court may order a child subject to a petition under RCW 28A.225.035 to do one or more of the following:

    a. Attend the child's current school, and set forth minimum attendance requirements, which shall not consider a suspension day as an unexcused absence;

    b. If there is space available and the program can provide educational services appropriate for the child, order the child to attend another public school, an alternative education program, center, a skill center, dropout prevention program, or another public educational program;

    c. Attend a private nonsectarian school or program including an education center. Before ordering a child to attend an approved or certified private nonsectarian school or program, the court shall: (i) Consider the public and private programs available; (ii) find that placement is in the best interest of the child; and (iii) find that the private school or program is willing to accept the child and will not charge any fees in addition to those established by contract with the student's school district. If the court orders the child to enroll in a private school or program, the child's school district shall contract with the school or program to provide educational services for the child. The school district shall not be required to contract for a weekly rate that exceeds the state general apportionment dollars calculated on a weekly basis generated by the child and received by the district. A school district shall not be required to enter into a contract that is longer than the remainder of the school year. A school district shall not be required to enter into or continue a contract if the child is no longer enrolled in the district;

    d. Submit to a substance abuse assessment if the court finds on the record that such assessment is appropriate to the circumstances and behavior of the child and will facilitate the child's compliance with the mandatory attendance law and, if any assessment, including a urinalysis test ordered under this subsection indicates the use of controlled substances or alcohol, order the minor to abstain from the unlawful consumption of controlled substances or alcohol and adhere to the recommendations of the substance abuse assessment at no expense to the school; or

    e. Submit to a mental health evaluation or other diagnostic evaluation and adhere to the recommendations of the drug assessment, at no expense to the school, if the court finds on the court records that such evaluation is appropriate to the circumstances and behavior of the child, and will facilitate the child's compliance with the mandatory attendance law.

2. If the child fails to comply with the court order, the court may impose:

    a. Community restitution;

    b. Nonresidential programs with intensive wraparound services;

    c. A requirement that the child meet with a mentor for a specified number of times; or

    d. Other services and interventions that the court deems appropriate.

3. Any parent violating any of the provisions of either RCW 28A.225.010, 28A.225.015, or 28A.225.080 shall be fined not more than twenty-five dollars for each day of unexcused absence from school. The court shall remit fifty percent of the fine collected under this section to the child's school district. It shall be a defense for a parent charged with violating RCW 28A.225.010 to show that he or she exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to cause a child in his or her custody to attend school or that the child's school did not perform its duties as required in RCW 28A.225.020. The court may order the parent to provide community restitution instead of imposing a fine. Any fine imposed pursuant to this section may be suspended upon the condition that a parent charged with violating RCW 28A.225.010 shall participate with the school and the child in a supervised plan for the child's attendance at school or upon condition that the parent attend a conference or conferences scheduled by a school for the purpose of analyzing the causes of a child's absence.

4. If a child continues to be truant after entering into a court-approved order with the **community engagement** board under RCW 28A.225.035, the juvenile court shall find the child in contempt, and the court may impose alternatives to detention consistent with best practice models for reengagement with school.

5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the court's inherent contempt power or curtail its exercise.

6. Subsections (1), (2), and (4) of this section shall not apply to a six or seven year old child required to attend public school under RCW 28A.225.015.
