# House Bill 1568

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1568.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that certain businesses in Washington have experienced significant and unanticipated impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Small businesses have fewer reserves and fewer resources to rely upon in periods of downturn. Those businesses owned by historically disadvantaged groups, such as women, minority populations, and immigrants, often experience a compounding of those issues experienced across the business community. These businesses form the backbone of Washington's diverse and resilient economy, and their survival is crucial to the state's continuing growth and vitality. For these already disadvantaged small businesses, the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been particularly devastating.

2. The legislature finds that ESSB 5061, passed by the legislature and signed by the governor earlier in the 2021 session, mitigated immediate impacts to employers through caps on the social tax, suspension of the solvency surcharge, and relief of certain benefit charges.

3. The legislature now intends to address the disproportionate impacts on small businesses beyond the limited time period addressed in ESSB 5061, and particularly those small businesses in industry sectors uniquely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislature intends to provide this targeted relief through the one-time application of funds, in order to provide critical support for many of the businesses that are essential to Washington's recovery and ongoing economic vitality, while maintaining a healthy unemployment insurance trust fund for Washington's workers.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [50.16](/rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.16_funds.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.16_funds.md) for context.

1. The unemployment insurance relief account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. Revenues to the account consist of appropriations and transfers by the legislature and all other funding directed for deposit into the account. Only the commissioner of the employment security department or the commissioner's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for reimbursing the unemployment compensation fund created in RCW 50.16.010 for forgiven benefits for COVID-19 impacted businesses pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of this act. The account is subject to the allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

2. By July 1, 2022, the commissioner must certify to the state treasurer the amount of any unobligated moneys in the unemployment insurance relief account that were appropriated by the legislature from the general fund during the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, and the treasurer must transfer those moneys back to the general fund.
