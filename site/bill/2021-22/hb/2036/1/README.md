## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [10.116.040](/rcw/10_criminal_procedure/10.116_peace_officers—tactics_and_equipment.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/10_criminal_procedure/10.116_peace_officers—tactics_and_equipment.md) for context.

1. A law enforcement agency may not acquire or use any **prohibited** equipment. Any law enforcement agency in possession of **prohibited** equipment as of July 25, 2021, shall return **,** destroy**, or otherwise dispose of** the equipment by December 31, 2022.

2.

For the purposes of this section:

    a.

"Grenade" refers to any explosive grenade designed to injure or kill subjects, such as a fragmentation grenade or antitank grenade, or any incendiary grenade designed to produce intense heat or fire. "Grenade" does not include other nonexplosive grenades designed to temporarily incapacitate or disorient subjects without causing permanent injury, such as a stun grenade, sting grenade, smoke grenade, tear gas grenade, or blast ball.

    b. **"Machine gun" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 9.41.010. A firearm that was previously a "machine gun" that has since been permanently modified to no longer meet the capabilities of a "machine gun" as defined in RCW 9.41.010 shall not be considered a "machine gun."**

    c. **"Prohibited equipment" means rifles of .50 caliber or greater, machine guns, armed helicopters, armed or armored drones, armed vessels, armed vehicles, armed aircraft, tanks, long range acoustic hailing devices, rockets, rocket launchers, bayonets, grenades, missiles, directed energy systems, and electromagnetic spectrum weapons.**

    d. **"Rifle" has the same meaning as provided under RCW 9.41.010, except "rifle" does not refer to any device designed or used to deploy less lethal equipment.**

4. This section does not prohibit a law enforcement agency from participating in a federal military equipment surplus program, provided that any equipment acquired through the program does not constitute **prohibited** equipment. This may include, for example: Medical supplies; hospital and health care equipment; office supplies, furniture, and equipment; school supplies; warehousing equipment; unarmed vehicles and vessels; conducted energy weapons; public address systems; scientific equipment; and protective gear and weather gear.
