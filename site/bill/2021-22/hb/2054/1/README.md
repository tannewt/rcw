2. [Empty]

    a. The school district must install, operate, and maintain the recording devices required by this section for school buses that are the property of the school district.

    b. The school district and the entity with which the school district contracts for the provision of student transportation shall, by mutual agreement, provide for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the recording devices required by this section for school buses that are not the property of the school district.
