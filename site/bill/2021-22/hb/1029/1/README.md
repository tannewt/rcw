# House Bill 1029

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1029.pdf)
## Section 1
The state Constitution declares that all political power is inherent in the people, and governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and are established to protect and maintain individual rights. The Constitution further declares that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, and the right of petition and of the people peaceably to assemble for the common good shall never be abridged. Therefore, the legislature intends to protect the rights of the people by limiting and constraining the governor's power and scope of authority in the event of an emergency by ensuring proclamations of emergency are subject to judicial review and requiring legislative action to extend any proclamation.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [43.06.210](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.006_governor.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.006_governor.md) for context.

1. The proclamation of a state of emergency and other proclamations or orders issued by the governor pursuant to RCW 43.06.010, and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270 as now or hereafter amended shall be in writing and shall be signed by the governor and shall then be filed with the secretary of state. A proclamation of a state of emergency is effective upon the governor's signature.

2. **A proclamation of a state of emergency must identify the area of the state in which the emergency exists. Such area may not exceed a single county in any single proclamation. The governor may issue multiple proclamations intended to address simultaneous emergencies in multiple counties, even where those simultaneous emergencies arise from the same facts constituting an emergency.**

3. **A proclamation of a state of emergency must identify the specific facts giving rise to the emergency in the area covered by that proclamation and the specific facts under which order will be determined to have been restored in the area affected. Facts giving rise to an emergency may not include circumstances addressed in existing statutes or regulations.**

4. The governor shall give as much public notice as practical through the news media of the issuance of proclamations or orders pursuant to RCW 43.06.010, and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270 as now or hereafter amended.

5. The state of emergency shall cease to exist **the earlier of:**

    a. **The** issuance of a proclamation of the governor declaring its termination: PROVIDED, That the governor must terminate said state of emergency proclamation when order has been restored in the area affected**; or**

    b. **14 days after a proclamation of a state of emergency is signed by the governor unless extended by the legislature through concurrent resolution. If the legislature is not in session, the state of emergency may be extended in writing by the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives until the legislature can extend the state of emergency by concurrent resolution. No individual extension may exceed 14 days. The legislature may pass subsequent resolutions of extension. For purposes of this section, "leadership of the senate and the house of representatives" means the majority and minority leaders of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives.**

6. **Any person may seek judicial review in the superior court of the county subject to an emergency proclamation to determine whether the facts identified in a proclamation as constituting an emergency constitute a circumstance addressed in existing law. Such judicial determination constitutes a determination that the proclamation of emergency is void**.


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [43.06.220](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.006_governor.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.006_governor.md) for context.

1. The governor after proclaiming a state of emergency and prior to terminating such, may, in the area described by the proclamation issue an order prohibiting:

    a. Any person being on the public streets, or in the public parks, or at any other public place during the hours declared by the governor to be a period of curfew;

    b. Any number of persons, as designated by the governor, from assembling or gathering on the public streets, parks, or other open areas of this state, either public or private;

    c. The manufacture, transfer, use, possession or transportation of a molotov cocktail or any other device, instrument or object designed to explode or produce uncontained combustion;

    g. The use of certain streets, highways or public ways by the public; and

    h. Such other activities as he or she reasonably believes **must** be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace.

2. The governor after proclaiming a state of emergency and prior to terminating such may, in the area described by the proclamation, issue an order or orders concerning waiver or suspension of statutory obligations or limitations in the following areas:

    a. Liability for participation in interlocal agreements;

    b. Inspection fees owed to the department of labor and industries;

    c. Application of the family emergency assistance program;

    d. Regulations, tariffs, and notice requirements under the jurisdiction of the utilities and transportation commission;

    f. Permits for industrial, business, or medical uses of alcohol; and

    g. Such other statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to legislative leadership and impacted local governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g).

3. **Any order issued under subsections (1) and (2)(g) of this section must be narrowly tailored, using the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling government interest to protect the public.**

4. No order or orders  under  this section may continue for longer than **14** days unless extended **or modified** by the legislature through concurrent resolution. If the legislature is not in session, the **order or orders** may be extended **or modified** in writing by the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives **for up to 30 days,** until the legislature can extend the waiver or suspension by concurrent resolution. For purposes of this section, "leadership of the senate and the house of representatives" means the majority and minority leaders of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives.

5. Any person willfully violating any provision of an order issued by the governor under this section is guilty of a  misdemeanor.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [4.12.020](/rcw/04_civil_procedure/4.012_venue—jurisdiction.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/04_civil_procedure/4.012_venue—jurisdiction.md) for context.

3. For the recovery of damages for injuries to the person or for injury to personal property, the plaintiff shall have the option of suing either in the county in which the cause of action or some part thereof arose, or in the county in which the defendant resides, or if there be more than one defendant, where some one of the defendants resides, at the time of the commencement of the action**; and**

4. **For judicial review of an emergency proclamation under RCW 43.06.210**.


## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [34.05.350](/rcw/34_administrative_law/34.05_administrative_procedure_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/34_administrative_law/34.05_administrative_procedure_act.md) for context.

1. If an agency for good cause finds:

    a. That immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest;

    b. That state or federal law or federal rule or a federal deadline for state receipt of federal funds requires immediate adoption of a rule; or

    c. In order to implement the requirements or reductions in appropriations enacted in any budget for fiscal year 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013, which necessitates the need for the immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the fiscal needs or requirements of the agency,

the agency may dispense with those requirements and adopt, amend, or repeal the rule on an emergency basis. The agency's finding and a concise statement of the reasons for its finding shall be incorporated in the order for adoption of the emergency rule or amendment filed with the office of the code reviser under RCW 34.05.380 and with the rules review committee.

2. An emergency rule adopted under this section takes effect upon filing with the code reviser, unless a later date is specified in the order of adoption, and may not remain in effect for longer than one hundred twenty days after filing. **An emergency rule adopted during a state of emergency proclaimed under RCW 43.06.210 may not remain in effect for longer than 30 days after the state of emergency ceases to exist.** Identical or substantially similar emergency rules may not be adopted in sequence unless conditions have changed or the agency has filed notice of its intent to adopt the rule as a permanent rule, and is actively undertaking the appropriate procedures to adopt the rule as a permanent rule. This section does not relieve any agency from compliance with any law requiring that its permanent rules be approved by designated persons or bodies before they become effective.

3. Within seven days after the rule is adopted, any person may petition the governor requesting the immediate repeal of a rule adopted on an emergency basis by any department listed in RCW 43.17.010. Within seven days after submission of the petition, the governor shall either deny the petition in writing, stating his or her reasons for the denial, or order the immediate repeal of the rule. In ruling on the petition, the governor shall consider only whether the conditions in subsection (1) of this section were met such that adoption of the rule on an emergency basis was necessary. If the governor orders the repeal of the emergency rule, any sanction imposed based on that rule is void. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit adoption of any rule as a permanent rule.

4. **No more than three days after an emergency rule is adopted during a state of emergency proclaimed under RCW 43.06.210, the agency shall provide an opportunity for oral comment to be received by the agency in a rule-making hearing that follows RCW 34.05.325 (4) and (5). The agency must provide notice of the hearing as described in RCW 34.05.320(1).**

    h. Cause to be made from time to time, personal health and sanitation inspections at state owned or contracted institutions and facilities to determine compliance with sanitary and health care standards as adopted by the department, and require the governing authorities thereof to take such action as will conserve the health of all persons connected therewith, and report the findings to the governor;

    i. Review and approve plans for public water system design, engineering, operation, maintenance, financing, and emergency response, as required under state board of health rules;

    k. Establish and maintain laboratory facilities and services as are necessary to carry out the responsibilities of the department.

2. [Empty]

    a. **Any emergency order or policy issued by the secretary in response to a proclaimed state of emergency must identify the area of the state in which the emergency exists. Such area may not exceed a single county in any single proclamation. The secretary may issue multiple proclamations intended to address simultaneous emergencies in multiple counties, even where those simultaneous emergencies arise from the same facts constituting an emergency.**

    b. **No order or policy issued under this subsection (2) may continue for longer than 14 days unless extended or modified by the legislature through concurrent resolution. If the legislature is not in session, the order or policy may be extended or modified in writing by the majority and minority leaders of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives for up to 30 days, until the legislature can extend the order or policy by concurrent resolution.**

    c. **Any order or policy issued under this subsection (2) must be narrowly tailored, using the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling government interest to protect the public.**
