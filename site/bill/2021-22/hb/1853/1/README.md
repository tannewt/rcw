# House Bill 1853

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1853.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that certain chemicals used in cosmetic products are linked to harmful impacts on health, such as cancer, birth defects, damage to the reproductive system, organ system toxicity, and endocrine disruption. Many of these chemicals have been identified by the state of Washington as high priority chemicals of concern.

2. The legislature further finds that harmful ingredients in cosmetics and personal care products disproportionately affect women of color. Some of the most toxic ingredients are marketed towards women of color and women who use these products may be more likely to experience harmful health effects. Every day, citizens of Washington may be using personal care products without realizing that the products contain chemicals that present serious health risks. Nail and hair salon workers, and other workers in the beauty industry, regularly and frequently handle a multitude of products that contain ingredients that may be classified as carcinogens, reproductive toxicants, asthmagens, neurotoxicants, allergens, and other chemicals of concern. Extended exposure on a daily basis makes it imperative that workers be provided with information on potential hazards.

3. In order to ensure the safety of cosmetic products and protect Washington citizens from toxic exposures, the legislature intends to prohibit use of toxic chemicals found in cosmetic and personal care products, require manufacturers to disclose information on their websites to provide consumers and workers with ingredient information about cosmetic products that encourages informed purchasing decisions and reduces public health impacts from exposure to potentially harmful chemicals, and join other jurisdictions in creating a safer global standard for cosmetic products and bringing more sustainable, safer ingredients to the marketplace.
