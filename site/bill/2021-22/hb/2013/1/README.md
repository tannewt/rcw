## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [46.08](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.08_general_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.08_general_provisions.md) for context.

1. The department is prohibited from releasing personal or identity information associated with vehicle or vessel records, driver's license or identicard records, or driving records, for which the sale or sharing of that information is not explicitly authorized in chapter 46.12 or 46.52 RCW, or otherwise authorized under state law. This prohibition extends to all persons, as defined in RCW 46.04.405. The prohibition applies to anonymized data from which personal and identity information has been removed, but that retains unique identifiers which could enable the anonymized data to be reassociated with personal or identity information that state law permits be sold or shared.
