## Section 1
The legislature finds and declares that:

1. Washingtonians need improved access to high-speed internet now more than ever to meet a variety of demands including, but not limited to, remote work, distance learning, telehealth, emergency response and public safety, agriculture, innovation, and commerce;

2. High-speed internet is delivered to Washingtonians through wireline and wireless broadband infrastructure that is installed either aerially or underground. Wireless broadband service relies on wireline facilities, especially fiber backhaul lines;

3. Deployment of fiber is critical to connect more Washingtonians to broadband;

4. Quick and cost-effective ways to install fiber include trenching, boring, and microtrenching; and

5. By expediting fiber deployment, cities, towns, and counties will help expedite the availability of broadband access across Washington.

> This section modifies existing section [35.99.010](/rcw/35_cities_and_towns/35.099_telecommunications_cable_television_service—use_of_right-of-way.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/35_cities_and_towns/35.099_telecommunications_cable_television_service—use_of_right-of-way.md) for context.

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
