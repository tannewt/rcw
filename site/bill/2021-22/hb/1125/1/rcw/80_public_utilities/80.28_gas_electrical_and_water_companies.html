<p>Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Bondable conservation investment&quot; means all expenditures made by electrical, gas, or water companies with respect to energy or water conservation measures and services intended to improve the efficiency of electricity, gas, or water end use, including related carrying costs if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The conservation measures and services do not produce assets that would be bondable utility property under the general utility mortgage of the electrical, gas, or water company;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission has determined that the expenditures were incurred in conformance with the terms and conditions of a conservation service tariff in effect with the commission at the time the costs were incurred, and at the time of such determination the commission finds that the company has proven that the costs were prudent, that the terms and conditions of the financing are reasonable, and that financing under this chapter is more favorable to the customer than other reasonably available alternatives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission has approved inclusion of the expenditures in rate base and has not ordered that they be currently expensed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission has not required that the measures demonstrate that energy savings have persisted at a certain level for a certain period before approving the cost of these investments as bondable conservation investment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Conservation bonds&quot; means bonds, notes, certificates of beneficial interests in trusts, or other evidences of indebtedness or ownership that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The commission determines at or before the time of issuance are issued to finance or refinance bondable conservation investment by an electrical, gas or water company; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rely partly or wholly for repayment on conservation investment assets and revenues arising with respect thereto.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Conservation investment assets&quot; means the statutory right of an electrical, gas, or water company:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To have included in rate base all of its bondable conservation investment and related carrying costs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To receive through rates revenues sufficient to recover the bondable conservation investment and the costs of equity and debt capital associated with it, including, without limitation, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on conservation bonds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Finance subsidiary&quot; means any corporation, company, association, joint stock association, or trust that is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by an electrical, gas, or water company, or in the case of a trust issuing conservation bonds consisting of beneficial interests, for which an electrical, gas, or water company or a subsidiary thereof is the grantor, or an unaffiliated entity formed for the purpose of financing or refinancing approved conservation investment, and that acquires conservation investment assets directly or indirectly from such company in a transaction approved by the commission.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>All charges made, demanded or received by any gas company, electrical company, wastewater company, or water company for gas, electricity or water, or for any service rendered or to be rendered in connection therewith, shall be just, fair, reasonable and sufficient. Reasonable charges necessary to cover the cost of administering the collection of voluntary donations for the purposes of supporting the development and implementation of evergreen community management plans and ordinances under RCW 80.28.300 must be deemed as prudent and necessary for the operation of a utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every gas company, electrical company, wastewater company, and water company shall furnish and supply such service, instrumentalities and facilities as shall be safe, adequate and efficient, and in all respects just and reasonable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All rules and regulations issued by any gas company, electrical company, wastewater company, or water company, affecting or pertaining to the sale or distribution of its product or service, must be just and reasonable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utility service for residential space heating shall not be terminated between November 15 through March 15 if the customer:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Notifies the utility of the inability to pay the bill, including a security deposit. This notice should be provided within five business days of receiving a payment overdue notice unless there are extenuating circumstances. If the customer fails to notify the utility within five business days and service is terminated, the customer can, by paying reconnection charges, if any, and fulfilling the requirements of this section, receive the protections of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides self-certification of household income for the prior twelve months to a grantee of the department of commerce, which administers federally funded energy assistance programs. The grantee shall determine that the household income does not exceed the maximum allowed for eligibility under the state's plan for low-income energy assistance under 42 U.S.C. 8624 and shall provide a dollar figure that is seven percent of household income. The grantee may verify information provided in the self-certification;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has applied for home heating assistance from applicable government and private sector organizations and certifies that any assistance received will be applied to the current bill and future utility bills;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has applied for low-income weatherization assistance to the utility or other appropriate agency if such assistance is available for the dwelling;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agrees to a payment plan and agrees to maintain the payment plan. The plan will be designed both to pay the past due bill by the following October 15th and to pay for continued utility service. If the past due bill is not paid by the following October 15, the customer is not eligible for protections under this chapter until the past due bill is paid. The plan may not require monthly payments in excess of seven percent of the customer's monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter during November 15 through March 15. A customer may agree to pay a higher percentage during this period, but shall not be in default unless payment during this period is less than seven percent of monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter. If assistance payments are received by the customer subsequent to implementation of the plan, the customer shall contact the utility to reformulate the plan; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agrees to pay the moneys owed even if he or she moves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The utility shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Include in any notice that an account is delinquent and that service may be subject to termination, a description of the customer's duties in this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assist the customer in fulfilling the requirements under this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be authorized to transfer an account to a new residence when a customer who has established a plan under this section moves from one residence to another within the same utility service area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be permitted to disconnect service if the customer fails to honor the payment program. Utilities may continue to disconnect service for those practices authorized by law other than for nonpayment as provided for in this subsection. Customers who qualify for payment plans under this section who default on their payment plans and are disconnected can be reconnected and maintain the protections afforded under this chapter by paying reconnection charges, if any, and by paying all amounts that would have been due and owing under the terms of the applicable payment plan, absent default, on the date on which service is reconnected; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise the customer in writing at the time it disconnects service that it will restore service if the customer contacts the utility and fulfills the other requirements of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A payment plan implemented under this section is consistent with RCW 80.28.080.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every gas company and electrical company shall offer residential customers the option of a budget billing or equal payment plan. The budget billing or equal payment plan shall be offered low-income customers eligible under the state's plan for low-income energy assistance prepared in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 8624(C)(1) without limiting availability to certain months of the year, without regard to the length of time the customer has occupied the premises, and without regard to whether the customer is the tenant or owner of the premises occupied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every gas company, electrical company, wastewater company, and water company shall construct and maintain such facilities in connection with the manufacture and distribution of its product, or provision of its services, as will be efficient and safe to its employees and the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agreement between the customer and the utility, whether oral or written, does not waive the protections afforded under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In establishing rates or charges for water service, water companies as defined in RCW 80.04.010 may consider the achievement of water conservation goals and the discouragement of wasteful water use practices.</p>
</li>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that the potential for meeting future energy needs through conservation measures, including energy conservation loans, energy audits, the use of appropriate tree plantings for energy conservation, and the use of renewable resources, such as solar energy, wind energy, wood, wood waste, municipal waste, agricultural products and wastes, hydroelectric energy, geothermal energy, and end-use waste heat, may not be realized without incentives to public and private energy utilities. The legislature therefore finds and declares that actions and incentives by state government to promote conservation and the use of renewable resources would be of great benefit to the citizens of this state by encouraging efficient energy use and a reliable supply of energy based upon renewable energy resources.</p>

<p>In establishing rates for each gas and electric company regulated by this chapter, the commission shall adopt policies to encourage meeting or reducing energy demand through cogeneration as defined in *RCW 82.35.020, measures which improve the efficiency of energy end use, and new projects which produce or generate energy from renewable resources, such as solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, geothermal energy, wood, wood waste, municipal wastes, agricultural products and wastes, and end-use waste heat. These policies shall include but are not limited to allowing a return on investment in measures to improve the efficiency of energy end use, cogeneration, or projects which produce or generate energy from renewable resources which return is established by adding an increment of two percent to the rate of return on common equity permitted on the company's other investment. Measures or projects encouraged under this section are those for which construction or installation is begun after June 12, 1980, and before January 1, 1990, and which, at the time they are placed in the rate base, are reasonably expected to save, produce, or generate energy at a total incremental system cost per unit of energy delivered to end use which is less than or equal to the incremental system cost per unit of energy delivered to end use from similarly available conventional energy resources which utilize nuclear energy or fossil fuels and which the gas or electric company could acquire to meet energy demand in the same time period. The rate of return increment shall be allowed for a period not to exceed thirty years after the measure or project is first placed in the rate base.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Electrical, gas, and water companies, or finance subsidiaries may pledge conservation investment assets as collateral for conservation bonds by obtaining an order of the commission approving an issue of conservation bonds and providing for a security interest in conservation investment assets. A security interest in conservation investment assets is created and perfected only upon entry of an order by the commission approving a contract governing the granting of the security interest and the filing with the department of licensing of a UCC-1 financing statement, showing such pledgor as &quot;debtor&quot; and identifying such conservation investment assets and the bondable conservation investment associated therewith. The security interest is enforceable against the debtor and all third parties, subject to the rights of any third parties holding security interests in the conservation investment assets perfected in the manner described in this section, if value has been given by the purchasers of conservation bonds. An approved security interest in conservation investment assets is a continuously perfected security interest in all revenues and proceeds arising with respect to the associated bondable conservation investment, whether or not such revenues have accrued. Upon such approval, the priority of such security interest shall be as set forth in the contract governing the conservation bonds. Conservation investment assets constitute property for the purposes of contracts securing conservation bonds whether or not the related revenues have accrued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relative priority of a security interest created under this section is not defeated or adversely affected by the commingling of revenues arising with respect to conservation investment assets with other funds of the debtor. The holders of conservation bonds shall have a perfected security interest in all cash and deposit accounts of the debtor in which revenues arising with respect to conservation investment assets pledged to such holders have been commingled with other funds, but such perfected security interest is limited to an amount not greater than the amount of such revenues received by the debtor within twelve months before (a) any default under the conservation bonds held by the holders or (b) the institution of insolvency proceedings by or against the debtor, less payments from such revenues to the holders during such twelve-month period. If an event of default occurs under an approved contract governing conservation bonds, the holders of conservation bonds or their authorized representatives, as secured parties, may foreclose or otherwise enforce the security interest in the conservation investment assets securing the conservation bonds, subject to the rights of any third parties holding prior security interests in the conservation investment assets perfected in the manner provided in this section. Upon application by the holders of [or] their representatives, without limiting their other remedies, the commission shall order the sequestration and payment to the holders or their representatives of revenues arising with respect to the conservation investment assets pledged to such holders. Any such order shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any bankruptcy, reorganization, or other insolvency proceedings with respect to the debtor. Any surplus in excess of amounts necessary to pay principal, premium, if any, interest, and expenses arising under the contract governing the conservation bonds shall be remitted to the debtor electrical, gas, or water company or the debtor finance subsidiary.</p>

<p>The granting, perfection, and enforcement of security interests in conservation investment assets to secure conservation bonds is governed by this chapter rather than by *chapter 62A.9 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transfer of conservation investment assets by an electrical, gas, or water company to a finance subsidiary, which such parties have in the governing documentation expressly stated to be a sale or other absolute transfer, in a transaction approved in an order issued by the commission and in connection with the issuance by such finance subsidiary of conservation bonds, shall be treated as a true sale, and not as a pledge or other financing, of such conservation investment assets. According the holders of conservation bonds a preferred right to revenues of the electrical, gas, or water company, or the provision by such company of other credit enhancement with respect to conservation bonds, does not impair or negate the characterization of any such transfer as a true sale.</p>

<li>
<p>If the commission determines, after providing notice and opportunity for a hearing in the manner required for complaints under RCW 80.04.110, that a wastewater company is unfit to provide wastewater service on any system of sewerage, under its ownership, the commission may order the transfer of any such system or systems to a capable wastewater company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining whether a wastewater company is unfit to provide wastewater service on a system of sewerage in consultation with the department of health or the department of ecology as appropriate to the agencies' jurisdiction, the commission may consider the company's technical and managerial expertise to operate the system of sewerage, the company's financial soundness and the company's willingness and ability to make ongoing investments necessary to maintain compliance with statutory and regulatory standards for the safety, adequacy, efficiency, and reasonableness of the service provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before ordering the transfer of a system of sewerage owned by a wastewater company that is unfit to provide service, the commission must first determine that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Alternatives to the transfer are impractical or not economically feasible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The acquiring wastewater company is willing and able to acquire the system or systems of sewerage, [is] financially sound, and has the technical and managerial expertise to own and operate the system or systems of sewerage in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rates paid by existing customers served by the acquiring wastewater company will not increase unreasonably because of the acquisition of the system of sewerage or because of expenditures that may be necessary to assure compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards for the safety, adequacy, efficiency, and reasonableness of the service provided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sale price for the unfit wastewater company's system or systems of sewerage assets must be determined by agreement between the unfit wastewater company and the acquiring capable wastewater company subject to a finding by the commission that the agreed price is reasonable. A price is deemed reasonable if it does not exceed the original cost of plant in service, minus accumulated depreciation, minus contributions in aid to construction. If the unfit wastewater company and the acquiring capable wastewater company are unable to agree on the sale price or the commission finds that the agreed sale price is not reasonable, the acquiring capable wastewater company may initiate a condemnation proceeding in superior court in the manner provided by chapter 8.04 RCW to determine the compensation to be paid by the acquiring capable wastewater company for the failed system or systems of sewerage assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The capable wastewater company acquiring an unfit wastewater company's system or systems shall have the same immunity from liability as wastewater companies assuming substandard systems as set forth in RCW 80.28.275.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must provide copies of the notice required by subsection (1) of this section to the department of health or the department of ecology, as appropriate to the agencies' jurisdiction, and all proximate public entities providing wastewater utility service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any capable wastewater company approved by the commission to acquire the system or systems of sewerage of an unfit wastewater company must submit to the commission, for approval, a financial plan, including a timetable, for bringing the acquired system of sewerage assets into compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards. The acquiring capable wastewater company must also provide a copy of the plan to the department of health or the department of ecology, as appropriate to the agencies' jurisdiction, and other state or local agency as the commission may direct. The commission must give the department of health or the department of ecology, as appropriate to the agencies' jurisdiction, adequate opportunity to comment on the plan and must consider any comments submitted in deciding whether or not to approve the plan.</p>

<li>
<p>The commission may petition the Thurston county superior court pursuant to chapter 7.60 RCW to place a wastewater company in receivership. The petition must include the names of one or more qualified candidates for receiver who have consented to assume operation of the system of sewerage. The petition must also include a list of interested and qualified individuals, municipal corporations, and wastewater companies with experience in providing wastewater service and a history of satisfactory operation of a system of sewerage. If no other entity is willing and able to be appointed as the receiver, the court must appoint the county or other municipal corporation whose geographic boundaries include, in whole or in part, the system of sewerage at issue. The municipal corporation may designate one of its agencies or divisions to operate the system, or it may contract with another entity to operate the system. The department of health or department of ecology, whichever has jurisdiction, must provide regulatory oversight for managing the system of sewerage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any petition for receivership under subsection (1) of this section, the commission must recommend that the court grant the receiver full authority to act in the best interests of the customers served by the system of sewerage. The receiver must assess the capability, in conjunction with the department of health or ecology, whichever has jurisdiction, and local government, for the system to operate in compliance with health and safety standards. The receiver must report to the court and the commission its recommendations for the company's future operation of the system, including the formation of a water-sewer district or other public entity, or ownership by another existing wastewater company capable of providing service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a petition for receivership and verifying affidavit executed by an appropriate official allege an immediate and serious danger to residents constituting an emergency, the court must set the matter for hearing within three days and may appoint a temporary receiver ex parte upon the strength of such petition and affidavit pending a full evidentiary hearing, which must be held within fourteen days after receipt of the petition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court imposes a bond upon a receiver, the amount must reasonably relate to the level of operating revenue generated by, and the capital value of, the wastewater company. Any receiver appointed pursuant to this section may not be held personally liable for any good faith, reasonable effort to assume possession of, and to operate, the system in compliance with the court's orders, subject to the provisions of law governing clean water as referenced by the commission by rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court must authorize the receiver to impose reasonable assessments on the customers of the system of sewerage to recover expenditures for improvements necessary for the public health and safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must develop a plan for transfer of the system of sewerage to a new operator and submit its plan to the court. The commission must develop the plan after notice to, and an opportunity to participate by, the receiver, the municipal corporations whose geographic boundaries, in whole or in part, include the system of sewerage at issue, and the public. The commission must complete the plan no later than twelve months after appointment of a receiver.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If the commission finds that no private entity is able or willing to take over the system of sewerage and decides the system of sewerage should be taken over by a municipal corporation whose geographic boundaries include the system of sewerage at issue, in whole or in part, the commission must provide its findings to the court and the court may issue an order to that effect. If the court orders a municipal corporation to take over the system of sewerage, the municipal corporation must promptly institute negotiations to purchase the system. If, within six months of the court's order, the negotiations fail or otherwise do not result in a purchase, the municipal corporation must promptly initiate a condemnation proceeding to acquire the system. The court must terminate the receivership once the purchase is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the commission decides the system of sewerage should be taken over by a private entity, such as an individual or business, the commission must provide its findings to the court and the court may issue an order to that effect. If the court orders a private entity to take over the system of sewerage, the private entity must promptly institute negotiations to purchase the system. If, within six months of the court's order, the negotiations fail or otherwise do not result in a purchase, the private entity must promptly exercise its power of eminent domain granted by the legislature in subsection (9) of this section to acquire the system. The court must terminate the receivership once the purchase is complete.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other than pursuant to subsection (6)(a) and (b) of this section, the court may not terminate the receivership, and order the return of the system to the owners, unless the commission approves that action. The court may impose reasonable conditions upon the return of the system to the owner, including the posting of a bond or other security, routine performance and financial audits, employment of qualified operators and other staff or contracted services, compliance with financial viability requirements, or other measures sufficient to ensure the ongoing proper operation of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, as part of the ultimate disposition of the system, a condemnation proceeding is commenced to acquire the system of sewerage, the court shall oversee any appraisal of the system conducted under Title 7 RCW to assure that the appraised value properly reflects any reduced value because of the necessity to make improvements to the system. The court has the authority to approve the appraisal and to modify the appraisal based on any information provided at an evidentiary hearing. The court's determination of the proper value of the system, based on the appraisal, is final and only appealable if not supported by substantial evidence. If the appraised value is appealed, the court may order the system's ownership to be transferred upon payment of the approved appraised value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature grants any municipal corporation, and any private entity the power of eminent domain under the circumstances described in this section. However, a private entity must obtain authorization from the city, town, or county with jurisdiction over the subject property after the legislative authority of the city, town, or county has passed an ordinance requiring that property be taken for public use.

<p>In establishing rates for each electrical company regulated under this title, the commission may allow an incentive rate of return on investment through December 31, 2030, on capital expenditures for electric vehicle supply equipment that is deployed for the benefit of ratepayers, provided that the capital expenditures of the utilities' programs or plans in RCW 80.28.365(1) do not increase the annual retail revenue requirement of the utility, after accounting for the benefits of transportation electrification in each year of the plan, in excess of one-quarter of one percent. The commission must consider and may adopt other policies to improve access to and promote fair competition in the provision of electric vehicle supply equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An incentive rate of return on investment under this section may be allowed only if the company chooses to pursue capital investment in electric vehicle supply equipment on a fully regulated basis similar to other capital investments behind a customer's meter. In the case of an incentive rate of return on investment allowed under this section, an increment of up to two percent must be added to the rate of return on common equity allowed on the company's other investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The incentive rate of return on investment authorized in subsection (2) of this section applies only to projects which have been installed after July 1, 2015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The incentive rate of return on investment increment pursuant to this section may be earned only for a period up to the depreciable life of the electric vehicle supply equipment as defined in the depreciation schedules developed by the company and submitted to the commission for review. When the capital investment has fully depreciated, an electrical company may gift the electric vehicle supply equipment to the owner of the property on which it is located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By December 31, 2017, the commission must report to the appropriate committees of the legislature with regard to the use of any incentives allowed under this section, the quantifiable impacts of the incentives on actual electric vehicle deployment, and any recommendations to the legislature about utility participation in the electric vehicle market.</p>

Items on the list must be ranked according to risk, severity, complexity, and impact to the environment and public health. A gas company may also include in its filing methods to implement and deploy leak detection technology capable of rapidly identifying leaks. As part of its filing, the gas company must include a cost-effectiveness analysis and propose a cap for annual expenditures recoverable through a cost recovery mechanism to be approved by the commission. The cost-effectiveness analysis must include considerations of risk and impacts to the environment and public health. A gas company may consider a percent of rate base, percent of revenues, total expenditures, or other basis for its proposed cap.

If a multistate electrical company with fewer than 250,000 customers in Washington files a multiyear rate plan that provides for no increases in base rates in consecutive years beyond the initial rate year, the commission shall waive the requirements of this subsection provided that such a waiver results in just and reasonable rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commission must, in approving a multiyear rate plan, determine a set of performance measures that will be used to assess a gas or electrical company operating under a multiyear rate plan. These performance measures may be based on proposals made by the gas or electrical company in its initial application, by any other party to the proceeding in its response to the company's filing, or in the testimony and evidence admitted in the proceeding. In developing performance measures, incentives, and penalty mechanisms, the commission may consider factors including, but not limited to, lowest reasonable cost planning, affordability, increases in energy burden, cost of service, customer satisfaction and engagement, service reliability, clean energy or renewable procurement, conservation acquisition, demand side management expansion, rate stability, timely execution of competitive procurement practices, attainment of state energy and emissions reduction policies, rapid integration of renewable energy resources, and fair compensation of utility employees.</p>

<p>Electrical and natural gas companies maintain programs offering incentives for single-family and multifamily housing owners to have conservation and energy efficiency measures financed and installed at their premises. The owners of single-family and multifamily rental housing may be reluctant to participate in such programs when they are required to financially supplement the company's incentive to fully fund cost-effective conservation and energy efficiency measures. By not participating in an electrical or natural gas company's programs, single-family and multifamily rental housing owners expose tenants to higher energy bills and deny electrical and natural gas companies from being able to achieve greater reductions in energy consumption.</p>

<li>
<p>Investments made under this section must be secured through the meter and recovered through the regular billing paid by the tenant, including any successor tenant, or owner of the premises. If the bill is paid by the premises' owner, the company's investment must be recovered pursuant to a site-specific services agreement. The investment must be recovered as any other energy charge, including being subject to collection, until the authorized return on the investment has been fully recovered.
