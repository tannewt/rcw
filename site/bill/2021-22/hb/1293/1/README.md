## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [9.94A](/rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094A_sentencing_reform_act_of_1981.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094A_sentencing_reform_act_of_1981.md) for context.

1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the court may reduce any term of incarceration or other criminal penalties under this chapter or impose available alternatives as provided under subsection (3) of this section when sentencing any defendant for one or more crimes where: The defendant is a survivor of domestic violence committed by an intimate partner; the domestic violence suffered by the defendant was a significant contributing factor to the defendant's criminal conduct; and the generally applicable sentencing requirements under this chapter would be unduly harsh given the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the defendant.

2. [Empty]

    a. Prior to reducing a term of incarceration or imposing alternatives under this section, the court shall make findings as to whether the defendant qualifies under this section. The court may determine a defendant qualifies under this section regardless if the defendant previously raised any defense related to the domestic violence.

    b. The court may consider the following when making its finding as to whether the domestic violence suffered by the defendant was a significant contributing factor to his or her criminal conduct: Whether the defendant is being sentenced for a crime against an intimate partner who committed domestic violence against the defendant; whether, at any point in time, the defendant has been diagnosed with or treated for any behavioral health condition related to prior victimization; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has affected how the defendant perceives their safety and security; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has affected how the defendant perceives their ability to receive help through law enforcement or other government entities; evidence that the defendant's prior victimization has limited the defendant's ability to achieve financial independence; and any other factors deemed relevant by the court.

    c. In making findings under this section, the court may consider any of the following: Oral and written arguments; a written statement from the defendant; testimony from the defendant or from witnesses offered by either party; written statements from third parties regarding whether the defendant is a survivor of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking including, but not limited to, statements from a mental health or victim service provider or school administrator or teacher; medical records and documents; physical evidence; copies of restraining, antiharassment, or protection orders; police reports; recordings of 911 calls; expert testimony; and any other relevant evidence.

3. If the court finds that a defendant qualifies under this section, the court may, in its discretion:

    a. Impose a sentence below the standard range under RCW 9.94A.510, and below any mandatory minimum terms under RCW 9.94A.540 and 9.94A.570;

    b. Depart downward from any sentencing enhancements under RCW 9.94A.533; or

    c. Impose the sentencing alternative under section 3 of this act.

4. Nothing in this section modifies the authority of the court to impose any other available sentencing alternatives for a qualifying defendant including, but not limited to, alternatives under RCW 9.94A.650, 9.94A.655, 9.94A.660, 9.94A.670, or 9.94A.711.

5. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Domestic violence" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 26.50.010.

    b. "Intimate partner" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 26.50.010.


## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [9.94A](/rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094A_sentencing_reform_act_of_1981.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094A_sentencing_reform_act_of_1981.md) for context.

1. A person is eligible for the sentencing alternative under this section if the court finds that he or she meets the criteria under section 2 of this act. To assist the court in determining whether the alternative is appropriate for the defendant, the court may order the department to complete a risk assessment report or a chemical dependency screening report as provided in RCW 9.94A.500.

2. If the sentencing court determines that the person is eligible for the sentencing alternative under this section and that the sentencing alternative is appropriate and should be imposed, the court shall waive the sentence within the standard sentence range and any applicable enhancements, and instead impose: A reduced term of confinement with an extended term of community custody, as determined by the court; or waive the term of confinement and impose an extended term of community custody. The court has complete discretion to determine the term of incarceration and community custody, provided that the combined length of both does not exceed the standard range and enhancements applicable to the underlying crime or crimes for which the defendant has been convicted. For the term of community custody, the court may impose conditions as provided in RCW 9.94A.703 and may impose other affirmative conditions as the court considers appropriate, and the department may impose conditions and sanctions as authorized in RCW 9.94A.704 and 9.94A.737.

3. For any person serving a term of community custody under this section:

    a. The department shall report to the court if the person commits any violations of the conditions imposed by the court or the department;

    b. The court may order the person to report to court at any time during the period of community custody in order to evaluate the person's compliance or progress with his or her conditions, or to determine if any violations of the conditions have occurred;

    c. The court may modify the conditions of community custody or impose sanctions for violations, including extending the term of community custody; and

    d. The court may order the person to serve a term of total confinement within the standard range for the offense at any time during the period of community custody, if the person violates the conditions or requirements of the sentence.


## Section 4
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [9.94A](/rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094A_sentencing_reform_act_of_1981.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094A_sentencing_reform_act_of_1981.md) for context.

1. Any person who is currently serving a sentence imposed prior to the effective date of this section may petition the sentencing court for resentencing on the basis that he or she is a survivor of domestic violence committed by an intimate partner, the domestic violence he or she suffered was a significant contributing factor to his or her criminal conduct, and the prior sentence imposed by the court was unduly harsh given his or her personal history, character, and condition as well as the nature and circumstances of the crime.

2. The court may deny a petition for resentencing without a hearing. If the court orders a hearing on the petition, the court may receive testimony and evidence as provided under section 2(2) of this act. If the court grants a petition, the court may resentence the person in accordance with section 2(3) of this act, provided that any new sentence may not be greater than the initial sentence.

3. If a hearing on a petition is scheduled pursuant to this section, the prosecuting attorney shall make reasonable efforts to notify victims and survivors of victims of the petition and the date of hearing. The prosecuting attorney shall provide victims and survivors of victims access to available victim advocates and other related services. The court shall provide an opportunity for victims and survivors of victims of any crimes for which the defendant has been convicted to present a statement personally or by representation. The prosecuting attorney and the court shall comply with the requirements set forth in chapter 7.69 RCW.

4. A petition filed under this section does not reopen the defendant's conviction to challenges that would otherwise be barred.

5. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Domestic violence" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 26.50.010.

    b. "Intimate partner" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 26.50.010.

## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [9.94A.535](/rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094A_sentencing_reform_act_of_1981.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.094A_sentencing_reform_act_of_1981.md) for context.

The court may impose a sentence outside the standard sentence range for an offense if it finds, considering the purpose of this chapter, that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence. Facts supporting aggravated sentences, other than the fact of a prior conviction, shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of RCW 9.94A.537.

Whenever a sentence outside the standard sentence range is imposed, the court shall set forth the reasons for its decision in written findings of fact and conclusions of law. A sentence outside the standard sentence range shall be a determinate sentence.

If the sentencing court finds that an exceptional sentence outside the standard sentence range should be imposed, the sentence is subject to review only as provided for in RCW 9.94A.585(4).

A departure from the standards in RCW 9.94A.589 (1) and (2) governing whether sentences are to be served consecutively or concurrently is an exceptional sentence subject to the limitations in this section, and may be appealed by the offender or the state as set forth in RCW 9.94A.585 (2) through (6).

1. Mitigating Circumstances - Court to Consider

The court may impose an exceptional sentence below the standard range if it finds that mitigating circumstances are established by a preponderance of the evidence. The following are illustrative only and are not intended to be exclusive reasons for exceptional sentences.

    a. To a significant degree, the victim was an initiator, willing participant, aggressor, or provoker of the incident.

    b. Before detection, the defendant compensated, or made a good faith effort to compensate, the victim of the criminal conduct for any damage or injury sustained.

    c. The defendant committed the crime under duress, coercion, threat, or compulsion insufficient to constitute a complete defense but which significantly affected his or her conduct.

    d. The defendant, with no apparent predisposition to do so, was induced by others to participate in the crime.

    e. The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct, or to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law, was significantly impaired. Voluntary use of drugs or alcohol is excluded.

    f. The offense was principally accomplished by another person and the defendant manifested extreme caution or sincere concern for the safety or well-being of the victim.

    g. The operation of the multiple offense policy of RCW 9.94A.589 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    h. The defendant or the defendant's children suffered a continuing pattern of physical or sexual abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense is a response to that abuse.

    i. The defendant was making a good faith effort to obtain or provide medical assistance for someone who is experiencing a drug-related overdose.

    j. The current offense involved domestic violence, as defined in RCW 10.99.020, and the defendant suffered a continuing pattern of coercion, control, or abuse by the victim of the offense and the offense is a response to that coercion, control, or abuse.

    k. The defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide, by the operation of a vehicle in a reckless manner and has committed no other previous serious traffic offenses as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, and the sentence is clearly excessive in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    l. **The defendant is a survivor of domestic violence committed by an intimate partner, the domestic violence suffered by the defendant was a significant contributing factor to the defendant's criminal conduct, and the sentence would be unduly harsh given the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the defendant.**

2. Aggravating Circumstances - Considered and Imposed by the Court

The trial court may impose an aggravated exceptional sentence without a finding of fact by a jury under the following circumstances:

    a. The defendant and the state both stipulate that justice is best served by the imposition of an exceptional sentence outside the standard range, and the court finds the exceptional sentence to be consistent with and in furtherance of the interests of justice and the purposes of the sentencing reform act.

    b. The defendant's prior unscored misdemeanor or prior unscored foreign criminal history results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.

    c. The defendant has committed multiple current offenses and the defendant's high offender score results in some of the current offenses going unpunished.

    d. The failure to consider the defendant's prior criminal history which was omitted from the offender score calculation pursuant to RCW 9.94A.525 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient.

3. Aggravating Circumstances - Considered by a Jury - Imposed by the Court

Except for circumstances listed in subsection (2) of this section, the following circumstances are an exclusive list of factors that can support a sentence above the standard range. Such facts should be determined by procedures specified in RCW 9.94A.537.

    a. The defendant's conduct during the commission of the current offense manifested deliberate cruelty to the victim.

    b. The defendant knew or should have known that the victim of the current offense was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance.

    x. The defendant committed the offense against a public official or officer of the court in retaliation of the public official's performance of his or her duty to the criminal justice system.

1. Every offender who has been discharged under RCW 9.94A.637 may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the offender's record of conviction. If the court finds the offender meets the tests prescribed in subsection (2) of this section **or section 10 of this act**, the court may clear the record of conviction by: (a) Permitting the offender to withdraw the offender's plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty; or (b) if the offender has been convicted after a plea of not guilty, by the court setting aside the verdict of guilty; and (c) by the court dismissing the information or indictment against the offender.

2. **Except as provided under section 10 of this act, an** offender may not have the record of conviction cleared if:

    a. There are any criminal charges against the offender pending in any court of this state or another state, or in any federal court;

    b. The offense was a violent offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 or crime against **children or other** persons as defined in RCW 43.43.830, except the following offenses may be vacated if the conviction did not include a firearm, deadly weapon, or sexual motivation enhancement: (i) Assault in the second degree under RCW 9A.36.021; (ii) assault in the third degree under RCW 9A.36.031 when not committed against a law enforcement officer or peace officer; and (iii) robbery in the second degree under RCW 9A.56.210;

3. [Empty]

    a. Except as otherwise provided, once the court vacates a record of conviction under subsection (1) of this section, the fact that the offender has been convicted of the offense shall not be included in the offender's criminal history for purposes of determining a sentence in any subsequent conviction, and the offender shall be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment applications, an offender whose conviction has been vacated may state that the offender has never been convicted of that crime. A conviction that has been vacated under this section may not be disseminated or disclosed by the state patrol or local law enforcement agency to any person, except other criminal justice enforcement agencies. Nothing in this section affects or prevents the use of an offender's prior conviction in a later criminal prosecution, and nothing in this section affects the requirements for restoring a right to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.040.

    b. A conviction vacated on or after July 28, 2019, qualifies as a prior conviction for the purpose of charging a present recidivist offense occurring on or after July 28, 2019, and may be used to establish an ongoing pattern of abuse for purposes of RCW 9.94A.535.


## Section 12
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [9.96](/rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.096_restoration_of_civil_rights.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/09_crimes_and_punishments/9.096_restoration_of_civil_rights.md) for context.

2. In considering an application under this section, the court may consider the factors specified in section 2(2)(b) of this act. The court may consider any evidence offered by the defendant, the prosecutor, and third parties including, but not limited to, the types specified in section 2(2)(c) of this act; however, the court, in its discretion, may rely solely upon the sworn testimony of the applicant at a hearing before the court when granting an application under this section.

3. If the court finds that an applicant qualifies under this section, the court may, in the interest of justice, waive the restrictions under RCW 9.96.060(2) and vacate the conviction according to the process provided in RCW 9.96.060(1).

4. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Domestic violence" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 26.50.010.

    b. "Intimate partner" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 26.50.010.

    f. The applicant was convicted of a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor offense as defined in RCW 10.99.020, or the court determines after a review of the court file that the offense was committed by one family or household member against another or by one intimate partner against another, or the court, after considering the damage to person or property that resulted in the conviction, any prior convictions for crimes defined in RCW 10.99.020, or for comparable offenses in another state or in federal court, and the totality of the records under review by the court regarding the conviction being considered for vacation, determines that the offense involved domestic violence, and any one of the following factors exist:

If the person is deceased, a member of the person's family or an official representative of the tribe of which the person was a member may apply to the court on behalf of the deceased person. Notwithstanding the requirements of RCW 9.94A.640, the court shall vacate the record of conviction if:

    a. Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, once the court vacates a record of conviction under this section, the person shall be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense and the fact that the person has been convicted of the offense shall not be included in the person's criminal history for purposes of determining a sentence in any subsequent conviction. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment or housing applications, a person whose conviction has been vacated under this section may state that he or she has never been convicted of that crime. However, nothing in this section affects the requirements for restoring a right to possess a firearm under RCW 9.41.040. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, nothing in this section affects or prevents the use of an offender's prior conviction in a later criminal prosecution.

    b. When a court vacates a record of domestic violence as defined in RCW 10.99.020 under this section, the state may not use the vacated conviction in a later criminal prosecution unless the conviction was for: (i) Violating the provisions of a restraining order, no-contact order, or protection order restraining or enjoining the person or restraining the person from going on to the grounds of or entering a residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibiting the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location (RCW 10.99.040, 10.99.050, 26.09.300, 26.10.220, 26.26B.050, 26.44.063, 26.44.150, 26.50.060, 26.50.070, 26.50.130, 26.52.070, or 74.34.145); or (ii) stalking (RCW 9A.46.110). A vacated conviction under this section is not considered a conviction of such an offense for the purposes of 27 C.F.R. 478.11.

    c. A conviction vacated on or after July 28, 2019, qualifies as a prior conviction for the purpose of charging a present recidivist offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 occurring on or after July 28, 2019.

7. The clerk of the court in which the vacation order is entered shall immediately transmit the order vacating the conviction to the Washington state patrol identification section and to the local police agency, if any, which holds criminal history information for the person who is the subject of the conviction. The Washington state patrol and any such local police agency shall immediately update their records to reflect the vacation of the conviction, and shall transmit the order vacating the conviction to the federal bureau of investigation. A conviction that has been vacated under this section may not be disseminated or disclosed by the state patrol or local law enforcement agency to any person, except other criminal justice enforcement agencies.
