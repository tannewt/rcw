## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Ukrainians are the largest group of European residents in Washington and that from 2000 to 2019 Washington's Ukrainian population grew 69 percent.

2. Russia has engaged in an unjustified and unprovoked invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine.

3. Washington stands firmly in support of Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity and very strongly condemns Russia's military actions against Ukraine.

4. Preventing Washington's investment activity, whether directly or indirectly, from giving any aid to Russia as it commits these egregious acts of violence and human rights violations against the Ukrainian people is a compelling state interest.

5. Protecting Washington from financing any action against the Ukrainian people is a compelling state interest.
