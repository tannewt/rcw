# Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1175 as Recommended by Finance

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1175-S.E.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that youth who are Black and identify as LGBTQIA+ are most likely to be homeless in King county and across Washington state, where one-third of all homeless youth identify as LGBTQIA+ and one-third identify as Black. The legislature also finds that in addition to being the overwhelming majority of unhoused youth, they are also more likely to experience housing instability and remain most excluded from services, due to structural inequity and underlying race disparities. Further, the legislature finds that when they are offered shelter and housing placements, the placements do not reflect the cultural background or community experience of the young person.

The legislature, therefore, finds that providing a tax incentive to private homeowners to host a homeless youth, unaccompanied minor, and systems-impacted young adults will provide safe, transitional placement options to vulnerable young people. Moreover, this will assist in housing retention among communities of color while strengthening youth placement options and in-community housing diversity.

1. [Empty]

    a. Beginning with taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2024, real property is exempt from ad valorem taxation levied for a given year if that property was used as a host home for at least 180 days in the previous calendar year.

    b. The exemption provided in (a) of this subsection applies only to the state portion of ad valorem taxation levied under RCW 84.52.065.

2. A claim for exemption under subsection (1) of this section may be made and filed by the owner of the host home at any time during the year for exemption from taxes payable the following year upon forms as prescribed by the department. The forms must require an owner to provide sufficient evidence to support their eligibility to receive the exemption and the form may require a person to provide verification from the host home program that the real property was used as a host home as required in subsection (1) of this section. The claim for exemption must be submitted to the county assessor no later than December 31st of each year for exemption from taxes payable the following year.

3. [Empty]

    a. The county assessor must evaluate each claim for exemption to determine an owner's eligibility for the exemption. If the county assessor finds that an owner meets the qualifications established in subsection (1) of this section, the claim for exemption must be approved.

The county assessor must notify the owner of either determination.

    b. A claim for exemption approved under (a) of this subsection (3) is valid for one year and provides for the exemption from taxes payable in the year following the year in which the claim was due. An owner must file a new claim as provided in subsection (2) of this section for each year for which that person is eligible for the exemption.

4. The county assessor must accept any late claim for exemption made within three years after the due date of payment of taxes for which an exemption is sought. If the county assessor approves such a claim, the application constitutes a claim for refund under chapter 84.69 RCW.

5. For purposes of this section, "host home" and "host home program" have the same meaning as in RCW 74.15.020.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [84.69.020](/rcw/84_property_taxes/84.69_refunds.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/84_property_taxes/84.69_refunds.md) for context.

11. Paid as a state property tax levied upon property, the assessed value of which has been established by the state board of tax appeals for the year of such levy: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That the amount refunded shall only be for the difference between the state property tax paid and the amount of state property tax which would, when added to all other property taxes within the one percent limitation of Article VII, section 2 of the state Constitution equal one percent of the assessed value established by the board;

12. Paid on the basis of an assessed valuation which was adjudicated to be unlawful or excessive: PROVIDED, That the amount refunded shall be for the difference between the amount of tax which was paid on the basis of the valuation adjudged unlawful or excessive and the amount of tax payable on the basis of the assessed valuation determined as a result of the proceeding;

13. Paid on property acquired under RCW 84.60.050, and canceled under RCW 84.60.050(2);

No refunds under the provisions of this section shall be made because of any error in determining the valuation of property, except as authorized in subsections (9), (10), (11), and (12) of this section nor may any refunds be made if a bona fide purchaser has acquired rights that would preclude the assessment and collection of the refunded tax from the property that should properly have been charged with the tax. Any refunds made on delinquent taxes must include the proportionate amount of interest and penalties paid. However, no refunds as a result of an incorrect payment authorized under subsection (8) of this section made by a third party payee shall be granted. The county treasurer may deduct from moneys collected for the benefit of the state's levies, refunds of the state's levies including interest on the levies as provided by this section and chapter 84.68 RCW.

The county treasurer of each county must make all refunds determined to be authorized by this section, and by the first Monday in February of each year, report to the county legislative authority a list of all refunds made under this section during the previous year. The list is to include the name of the person receiving the refund, the amount of the refund, and the reason for the refund.
