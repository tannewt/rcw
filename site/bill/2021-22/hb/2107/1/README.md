## Section 3

3. Business entities having common ownership as defined in 26 U.S.C.

4. The single member of a single member limited liability company shall be treated as a consumer under this chapter.

## Section 4
A commercial data collector that has paid tax under this section may claim a credit against the tax paid with respect to a Washington consumer when another state imposes an excise tax identical to the tax imposed under this section with respect to the same consumer.


## Section 5

2. [Empty]
