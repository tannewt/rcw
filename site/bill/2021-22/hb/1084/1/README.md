## Section 1
High-efficiency electric space and water heating equipment, such as electric heat pumps for space heating and electric heat pump water heaters, lower overall energy demand and system costs and improve indoor air quality and environmental outcomes.

As Washington transitions to 100 percent clean electricity, switching from fossil-fuel based heating equipment to high-efficiency electric equipment will reduce climate impacts and fuel price risks in the long term.

In order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in RCW 70A.45.020, the state must require construction of increasingly low-emission energy efficient homes and buildings and achieve construction of zero fossil-fuel greenhouse gas emission homes and buildings by 2030. A 2020 report by the United States climate alliance found that Washington had nearly 90,000 clean energy jobs in 2019. The top categories of clean energy jobs are in the buildings sector, including: High-efficiency heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; energy efficiency technologies; and renewable heating and cooling. As the fastest growing clean energy industries in our state, work in these areas also supports job creation in other construction trades, which is a critical component of a clean energy economic recovery strategy.

Stable and predictable policy and regulatory frameworks are necessary to stimulate the critical social dialogue and collaboration to ensure a just transition for workers, including solutions to continue to provide meaningful work for skilled tradespersons, establish and sustain institutional and technical capacities to support affected workers, and mobilize funding and assistance to those in need. It is the intent of the legislature to both provide regulatory certainty and tools and resources to support the transition of companies that engage in the distribution of fossil fuels for residential and commercial heating, and to workers who are employed in the sectors affected by the transition to cleaner heating sources.

In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the need and potential for updating the building stock, more robust benchmarking and reporting for building performance, operations, and maintenance is needed. While the state has adopted comprehensive reporting requirements for larger commercial buildings, it currently lacks similar requirements for smaller commercial buildings. It is the intent of the legislature to extend existing building benchmarking and operations and maintenance planning requirements to smaller commercial buildings, in order to assess the needs and opportunities for job creation, incentives, and environmental and public health improvements.

Utilities have an important role in providing affordable and reliable heating and other energy services. As the state transitions to cleaner sources of energy, utilities are an important partner in helping their customers make smart energy choices, and actively supporting the replacement of fossil fuel-based space and water heating equipment with high-efficiency electric equipment.

Programs for the electrification of homes and buildings have the potential to allow electric utilities to optimize the use of electric grid infrastructure, improve the management of electric loads, better manage the integration of variable renewable energy resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector, mitigate the environmental impacts of utility operations and power purchases, and improve health outcomes for occupants due to improved indoor air quality.

Legislative clarity is important for utilities to offer programs and services, including incentives, in the electrification of homes and buildings for their customers. It is the intent of the legislature to achieve parity among all electric utilities so that each utility, depending on its unique circumstances, can determine its appropriate role in advancing home and building electrification for its customers.

In order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas limits in the energy sectors of the economy, more resources must be directed toward achieving electrification and decarbonization of residential and commercial heating loads, while continuing to protect customers, especially low-income customers and vulnerable communities.

    c. An assessment of conventional and commercially available nonconventional gas supplies;

    d. An assessment of the impact of the electrification of the building sector;

    e. An assessment of opportunities for using company-owned or contracted storage;

    f. An assessment of pipeline transmission capability and reliability;

    g. A comparative evaluation of the cost of natural gas purchasing strategies, electrification, storage options, delivery resources, and improvements in conservation using a consistent method to calculate cost-effectiveness;

    h. The integration of the demand forecasts and resource evaluations into a long-range integrated resource plan, for at least the next ten years, describing the mix of resources that is designated to meet current and future needs at the lowest reasonable cost to the utility and its ratepayers;

    i. A short-term plan outlining the specific actions to be taken by the utility in implementing the long-range integrated resource plan during each of the three years following submission;

    j. A report on the utility's progress towards implementing the recommendations contained in its previously filed plan;

    k. An assessment of current conditions, including:

        i. The economic, public health, and environmental conditions within the utility's service territory. These conditions are not restricted to the effects of utility actions, and the analysis must include relevant information from publicly available sources, including the cumulative impact analysis developed by the department of health under RCW 19.405.140;

        ii. The energy and nonenergy benefits and burdens associated with the utility's infrastructure and programs, including benefits and burdens caused by utility actions outside the utility's service territory;

    l. An evaluation of disparities in current conditions for overburdened communities and vulnerable populations based on the assessment required by (k)(i) of this subsection; and

    m. An evaluation of disparities in utility programs and infrastructure for overburdened communities and vulnerable populations based on the assessment required by (k)(ii) of this subsection.

3. Beginning September 1, 2021, each natural gas utility must submit a plan within two years after the date on which the previous plan was filed with the commission. Not later than twelve months prior to the due date of a plan, the utility must provide a work plan for informal commission review. The work plan must outline the content of the integrated resource plan to be developed by the utility and the method for assessing potential resources.

4. The work plan must outline the timing and extent of public participation. In addition, the commission must hear comment on the plan at a public hearing scheduled after the utility submits its plan for commission review.

5. The commission must consider the information reported in the integrated resource plan when the commission evaluates the performance of the utility in rate and other proceedings.

1. The governing authority of an electric utility formed under this chapter may adopt a beneficial electrification plan that establishes a finding that utility outreach and investment in the electrification of homes and buildings will provide net benefits to the utility. Prior to adopting a beneficial electrification plan, the governing authority must request the input of any natural gas company serving customers in the electric utility's service area on the development of the plan.

2. A beneficial electrification plan adopted under subsection (1) of this section must identify options and program schedules for the electrification of various energy end-uses or other energy sources.

3. In adopting a beneficial electrification plan under subsection (1) of this section, the governing authority of an electric utility formed under this chapter must determine that the sum of the benefits of an electrification option equals or exceeds the sum of its costs. As part of this determination, the governing authority may differentiate the level of benefits and costs accrued to highly impacted communities and vulnerable populations in the electric utility's service area, as those terms are defined in RCW 19.405.020.

    a. The benefits of beneficial electrification considered by a governing authority must include, but are not limited to, system impacts, as well as the following:

        i. Utility revenue from increased retail load from beneficial electrification;

        ii. Distribution system efficiencies resulting from demand response or other load management opportunities, including direct control and dynamic pricing, associated with the increased retail load;
