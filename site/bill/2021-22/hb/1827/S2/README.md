# Second Substitute House Bill 1827 as Recommended by Appropriations

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1827-S2.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that in order to address racial, economic, and social disparities in communities across the state created by the historical design and enforcement of state and federal criminal laws and penalties for drug possession and use in Washington state, aggressive approaches and targeted resources to support local design and control of community-based responses to these outcomes are required.

The legislature intends to transfer an amount no lower than $125,000,000 per year into the community reinvestment account. The legislature finds that to distribute money as quickly as possible it is necessary to use existing programs and networks until June 30, 2024, for phase one of implementation. Where possible, the department of commerce shall distribute funds in existing programs and networks that invest in people and communities intended to be reached by this act. However, the legislature recognizes that existing programs and networks may not reach the people who are most affected by historic laws and penalties for drug possession. Therefore, the legislature intends for phase two of implementation, beginning July 1, 2024, to shift away from existing programs and networks once the community reinvestment plan is developed, unless the plan directs the use of existing programs or networks.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [43.79](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.079_state_funds.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.079_state_funds.md) for context.

1. The community reinvestment account is created in the state treasury. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may only be made by the department of commerce for:

    a. Economic development, which includes addressing wealth disparities to promote asset building such as home ownership and expanding access to financial resources including, but not limited to, grants and loans for small businesses and entrepreneurs, financial literacy training, and other small business training and support activities;

    b. Civil and criminal legal assistance to provide postconviction relief and case assistance, including the expungement of criminal records and vacation of criminal convictions;

    c. Community-based violence intervention and prevention services; and

    d. Reentry services to facilitate successful transitions for persons formerly incarcerated in an adult correctional facility or juvenile residential facility in Washington.

2. Until June 30, 2024, for phase one of implementation, the department of commerce shall distribute money using existing programs and networks. Where possible, the department of commerce shall distribute funds in existing programs and networks that invest in people and communities intended to be reached by this act.

3. After June 30, 2024, for phase two of implementation, the department of commerce shall distribute funds according to the recommendations of the community reinvestment plan developed under section 3 of this act.


## Section 3
1. The department shall, in partnership with the office of equity, and "by and for community organizations" as defined by the office of equity, develop a community reinvestment plan for distribution of the funds in the community reinvestment account. The plan must include criteria for eligible communities and programs, development of accountability measures to ensure that distribution and use of funding meets intended purposes, and tracking of outcomes for the funds.

2. At a minimum, the plan must address how the community reinvestment account funding will:

    a. Produce significant long-term economic benefits to the state, a region of the state, or a particular community in the state;

    b. Result in significant long-term economic benefits in the form of new jobs, job retention, increased personal wealth, or higher incomes for citizens of the state or a particular community in the state; and

    c. Ensure that:

        i. Projects or programs do not require continuing state support;

        ii. An expenditure will not supplant private investment;

        iii. An expenditure is accompanied by additional public or private investment; and

        iv. Nonprofit, faith-based, and grassroots organizations are prioritized for funding.

3. In developing the plan, the department is encouraged to incorporate existing and ongoing work from relevant task forces and work groups including, but not limited to, the social equity in cannabis task force, the reentry council, and the homeownership disparities work group.

4. The department shall submit a report to the governor and relevant committees of the legislature by December 1, 2023, that includes a summary of spending in phase one of implementation and the community reinvestment plan.

5. The office of equity must review the plan.

6. The department shall use the plan to guide the distribution of funds in phase two of implementation. The department must review and update the plan every 10 years.

7. For purposes of this section:

    a. "Department" means the department of commerce; and

    b. "Plan" means the community reinvestment plan.
