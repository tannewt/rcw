4. In the event that an area agency on aging is unwilling to enter into or satisfactorily fulfill a contract or an individual consumer's need for case management services will be met through an alternative delivery system, the department is authorized to:

    a. Obtain the services through competitive bid; and

    b. Provide the services directly until a qualified contractor can be found.
