# Engrossed Third Substitute House Bill 1091 - Session Law Chapter 317 Year 2021 as Recommended by Transportation

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1091-S3.SL.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that rapid innovations in low carbon transportation technologies, including electric vehicles and clean transportation fuels, are at the threshold of widespread commercial deployment. In order to help prompt the use of clean fuels, other states have successfully implemented programs that reduce the carbon intensity of their transportation fuels. California and Oregon have both implemented low carbon fuel standards that are similar to the program created in this act, and both states have experienced biofuel sector growth and have successfully sited large biofuel projects that had originally been planned for Washington. Washington state has extensively studied the potential impact of a clean fuels program, and most projections show that a low carbon fuel standard would decrease greenhouse gas and conventional air pollutant emissions, while positively impacting the state's economy.

2. The legislature further finds that the health and welfare of the people of the state of Washington is threatened by the prospect of crumbling or swamped coastlines, rising water, and more intense forest fires caused by higher temperatures and related droughts, all of which are intensified and made more frequent by the volume of greenhouse gas emissions. As of 2017, the transportation sector contributes 45 percent of Washington's greenhouse gas emissions, and the legislature's interest in the life cycle of the fuels used in the state arises from a concern for the effects of the production and use of these fuels on Washington's environment and public health, including its air quality, snowpack, and coastline.

3. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support the deployment of clean transportation fuel technologies through a carefully designed program that reduces the carbon intensity of fuel used in Washington, in order to:

    a. Reduce levels of conventional air pollutants from diesel and gasoline that are harmful to public health;

    b. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels, which are the state's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions; and

    c. Create jobs and spur economic development based on innovative clean fuel technologies.

7. Beginning with the program year beginning in calendar year 2031, the department may not increase the carbon intensity reductions required by the applicable clean fuels program standard adopted by the department under subsection (5) of this section beyond a 10 percent reduction in carbon intensity until the:

    a. Joint legislative audit and review committee report required in section 15 of this act has been completed; and

    b. 2033 regular legislative session has adjourned, in order to allow an opportunity for the legislature to amend the requirements of this chapter in light of the report required in (a) of this subsection.

8. [Empty]

    a. In order to coordinate and synchronize the clean fuels program with other transportation-related investments, the department may not assign compliance obligations or allow the generation of credits under this chapter until a separate additive transportation revenue act becomes law, at which time the department of licensing must provide written notice to the chief clerk of the house of representatives, the secretary of the senate, and the office of the code reviser.

    b. For the purposes of this subsection, "additive transportation revenue act" means an act enacted after April 1, 2021, in which the state fuel tax under RCW 82.38.030 is increased by an additional and cumulative tax rate of at least five cents per gallon of fuel.

9. Transportation fuels exported from Washington are not subject to the greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements in this section.

10. To the extent the requirements of this chapter conflict with the requirements of chapter 19.112 RCW, the requirements of this chapter prevail.


## Section 4
The rules adopted by the department to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reductions per unit of fuel energy specified in section 3 of this act must include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Standards for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the transportation fuels throughout their life cycles, including but not limited to emissions from the production, storage, transportation, and combustion of transportation fuels and from changes in land use associated with transportation fuels and any permanent greenhouse gas sequestration activities.

    a. The rules adopted by the department under this subsection (1) may:

        i. Include provisions to address the efficiency of a fuel as used in a powertrain as compared to a reference fuel;

        ii. Consider carbon intensity calculations for transportation fuels developed by national laboratories or used by similar programs in other states; and

        iii. Consider changes in land use and any permanent greenhouse gas sequestration activities associated with the production of any type of transportation fuel.

    b. The rules adopted by the department under this subsection (1) must:

        i. Neutrally consider the life-cycle emissions associated with transportation fuels with respect to the political jurisdiction in which the fuels originated and may not discriminate against fuels on the basis of having originated in another state or jurisdiction. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to prohibit inclusion or assessment of emissions related to fuel production, storage, transportation, or combustion or associated changes in land use in determining the carbon intensity of a fuel;

        ii. Measure greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity and hydrogen based on a mix of generation resources specific to each electric utility participating in the clean fuels program. The department may apply an asset-controlling supplier emission factor certified or approved by a similar program to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels in another state;

        iii. Include mechanisms for certifying electricity that has a carbon intensity of zero. This electricity must include, at minimum, electricity:

(A) For which a renewable energy credit or other environmental attribute has been retired or used; and

(B) Produced using a zero emission resource including, but not limited to, solar, wind, geothermal, or the industrial combustion of biomass consistent with RCW 70A.45.020(3), that is directly supplied as a transportation fuel by the generator of the electricity to a metered customer for electric vehicle charging or refueling;

        iv. Allow the generation of credits associated with electricity with a carbon intensity lower than that of standard adopted by the department. The department may not require electricity to have a carbon intensity of zero in order to be eligible to generate credits from use as a transportation fuel; and

    v. Include procedures for setting and adjusting the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of fuel energy that is assigned to transportation fuels under this subsection.

    c. If the department determines that it is necessary for purposes of accurately measuring greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels, the department may require transportation fuel suppliers to submit data or information to be used for purposes of calculating greenhouse gas emissions that is different from or additional to the greenhouse gas emissions data reported under RCW 70A.15.2200(5)(a)(iii).

    d. If the department determines that it is necessary for purposes of accurately measuring greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity supplied to retail customers or hydrogen production facilities by an electric utility, the department may require electric utilities participating in the clean fuels program to submit data or information to be used for purposes of calculating greenhouse gas emissions that is different from or additional to the fuel mix disclosure information submitted under chapter 19.29A RCW. To the extent practicable, rules adopted by the department may allow data requested of utilities to be submitted in a form and manner consistent with other required state or federal data submissions;

2. Provisions allowing for the achievement of limits on the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of transportation fuels in section 3 of this act to be achieved by any combination of credit generating activities capable of meeting such standards. Where such provisions would not produce results counter to the emission reduction goals of the program or prove administratively burdensome for the department, the rules should provide each participant in the clean fuels program with the opportunity to demonstrate appropriate carbon intensity values taking into account both emissions from production facilities and elsewhere in the production cycle, including changes in land use and permanent greenhouse gas sequestration activities;

3. [Empty]

    a. Methods for assigning compliance obligations and methods for tracking tradable credits. The department may assign the generation of a credit when a fuel with associated life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions that are lower than the applicable per-unit standard adopted by the department under section 3 of this act is produced, imported, or dispensed for use in Washington, or when specified activities are undertaken that support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation in Washington;

    b. Mechanisms that allow credits to be traded and to be banked for future compliance periods; and

    c. Procedures for verifying the validity of credits and deficits generated under the clean fuels program;

4. Mechanisms to elect to participate in the clean fuels program for persons associated with the supply chains of transportation fuels that are eligible to generate credits consistent with subsection (3) of this section, including producers, importers, distributors, users, or retailers of such fuels, and electric vehicle manufacturers;

5. Mechanisms for persons associated with the supply chains of transportation fuels that are used for purposes that are exempt from the clean fuels program compliance obligations including, but not limited to, fuels used by aircraft, vessels, railroad locomotives, and other exempt fuels specified in section 5 of this act, to elect to participate in the clean fuels program by earning credits for the production, import, distribution, use, or retail of exempt fuels with associated life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions lower than the per-unit standard established in section 3 of this act;

6. Mechanisms that allow for the assignment of credits to an electric utility for electricity used within its utility service area, at minimum, for residential electric vehicle charging or fueling;

7. Cost containment mechanisms.

    a. Cost containment mechanisms must include the credit clearance market specified in subsection (8) of this section and may also include, but are not limited to:

        i. Procedures similar to the credit clearance market required in subsection (8) of this section that provide a means of compliance with the clean fuels program requirements in the event that a regulated person has not been able to acquire sufficient volumes of credits at the end of a compliance period; or

        ii. Similar procedures that ensure that credit prices do not significantly exceed credit prices in other jurisdictions that have adopted similar programs to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels.

    b. Any cost containment mechanisms must be designed to provide financial disincentive for regulated persons to rely on the cost containment mechanism for purposes of program compliance instead of seeking to generate or acquire sufficient credits under the program.

    c. The department shall harmonize the program's cost containment mechanisms with the cost containment rules in the states specified in section 7(1) of this act.

    d. The department shall consider mechanisms such as the establishment of a credit price cap or other alternative cost containment measures if deemed necessary to harmonize market credit costs with those in the states specified in section 7(1) of this act;

8. [Empty]

    a. [Empty]

        i. A credit clearance market for any compliance period in which at least one regulated party reports that the regulated party has a net deficit balance at the end of the compliance period, after retirement of all credits held by the regulated party, that is greater than a small deficit. A regulated party described by this subsection is required to participate in the credit clearance market.

        ii. If a regulated party has a small deficit at the end of a compliance period, the regulated party shall notify the department that it will achieve compliance with the clean fuels program during the compliance period by either: (A) Participating in a credit clearance market; or (B) carrying forward the small deficit.

    b. For the purposes of administering a credit clearance market required by this section, the department shall:

        i. Allow any regulated party, credit generator, or credit aggregator that holds excess credits at the end of the compliance period to voluntarily participate in the credit clearance market as a seller by pledging a specified number of credits for sale in the market;

        ii. Require each regulated party participating in the credit clearance market as purchaser of credits to:

(A) Have retired all credits in the regulated party's possession prior to participating in the credit clearance market; and

(B) Purchase the specified number of the total pledged credits that the department has determined are that regulated party's pro rata share of the pledged credits;

        iii. Require all sellers to:

(A) Agree to sell pledged credits at a price no higher than a maximum price for credits;

(B) Accept all offers to purchase pledged credits at the maximum price for credits; and

(C) Agree to withhold any pledged credits from sale in any transaction outside of the credit clearance market until the end of the credit clearance market, or if no credit clearance market is held in a given year, then until the date on which the department announces it will not be held.

    c. [Empty]

        i. The department shall set a maximum price for credits in a credit clearance market, consistent with states that have adopted similar clean fuels programs, not to exceed $200 in 2018 dollars for 2023.

        ii. For 2024 and subsequent years, the maximum price may exceed $200 in 2018 dollars, but only to the extent that a greater maximum price for credits is necessary to annually adjust for inflation, beginning on January 1, 2024, pursuant to the increase, if any, from the preceding calendar year in the consumer price index for all urban consumers, west region (all items), as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor.

    d. A regulated party that has a net deficit balance after the close of a credit clearance market:

        i. Must carry over the remaining deficits into the next compliance period; and

        ii. May not be subject to interest greater than five percent, penalties, or assertions of noncompliance that accrue based on the carryover of deficits under this subsection.

    e. If a regulated party has been required under (a) of this subsection to participate as a purchaser in two consecutive credit clearance markets and continues to have a net deficit balance after the close of the second consecutive credit clearance market, the department shall complete, no later than two months after the close of the second credit clearance market, an analysis of the root cause of an inability of the regulated party to retire the remaining deficits. The department may recommend and implement any remedy that the department determines is necessary to address the root cause identified in the analysis including, but not limited to, issuing a deferral, provided that the remedy implemented does not:

        i. Require a regulated party to purchase credits for an amount that exceeds the maximum price for credits in the most recent credit clearance market; or

        ii. Compel a person to sell credits.

    f. If credits sold in a credit clearance market are subsequently invalidated as a result of fraud or any other form of noncompliance on the part of the generator of the credit, the department may not pursue civil penalties against, or require credit replacement by, the regulated party that purchased the credits unless the regulated party was a party to the fraud or other form of noncompliance.

    g. The department may not disclose the deficit balances or pro rata share purchase requirements of a regulated party that participates in the credit clearance market;

9. Authority for the department to designate an entity to aggregate and use unclaimed credits associated with persons that elect not to participate in the clean fuels program under subsection (4) of this section.

## Section 12
1. No later than 30 calendar days before the commencement of a compliance period, the department shall issue an order declaring a forecast deferral if the fuel supply forecast under section 11 of this act projects that the amount of credits that will be available during the forecast compliance period will be less than 100 percent of the credits projected to be necessary for regulated parties to comply with the scheduled applicable clean fuels program standard adopted by the department for the forecast compliance period.

2. An order declaring a forecast deferral under this section must set forth:

    a. The duration of the forecast deferral;

    b. The types of fuel to which the forecast deferral applies; and

    c. Which of the following methods the department has selected for deferring compliance with the scheduled applicable clean fuels program standard during the forecast deferral:

        i. Temporarily adjusting the scheduled applicable clean fuels program standard to a standard identified in the order that better reflects the forecast availability of credits during the forecast compliance period and requiring regulated parties to comply with the temporary standard;

        ii. Requiring regulated parties to comply only with the clean fuels program standard applicable during the compliance period prior to the forecast compliance period; or

        iii. Suspending deficit accrual for part or all of the forecast deferral period.

3. [Empty]

    a. In implementing a forecast deferral, the department may take an action for deferring compliance with the clean fuels program standard other than, or in addition to, selecting a method under subsection (2)(c) of this section only if the department determines that none of the methods under subsection (2)(c) of this section will provide a sufficient mechanism for containing the costs of compliance with the clean fuels program standards during the forecast deferral.

Termination of a forecast deferral is effective on the first day of the next calendar quarter after the date that the order declaring the termination is adopted.


## Section 13
1. The director of the department may issue an order declaring an emergency deferral of compliance with the carbon intensity standard established under section 3 of this act no later than 15 calendar days after the date the department determines, in consultation with the governor's office and the department of commerce, that:

    a. Extreme and unusual circumstances exist that prevent the distribution of an adequate supply of renewable fuels needed for regulated parties to comply with the clean fuels program taking into consideration all available methods of obtaining sufficient credits to comply with the standard;

    b. The extreme and unusual circumstances are the result of a natural disaster, an act of God, a significant supply chain disruption or production facility equipment failure, or another event that could not reasonably have been foreseen or prevented and not the lack of prudent planning on the part of the suppliers of the fuels to the state; and

    c. It is in the public interest to grant the deferral such as when a deferral is necessary to meet projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of the renewable fuel in the state and that other methods of obtaining compliance credits are unavailable to compensate for the shortage of renewable fuel supply.

2. If the director of the department makes the determination required under subsection (1) of this section, such a temporary extreme and unusual deferral is permitted only if:

    a. The deferral applies only for the shortest time necessary to address the extreme and unusual circumstances;

    b. The deferral is effective for the shortest practicable time period the director of the department determines necessary to permit the correction of the extreme and unusual circumstances; and

    c. The director has given public notice of a proposed deferral.

3. An order declaring an emergency deferral under this section must set forth:

    a. The duration of the emergency deferral;

    c. Which of the following methods the department has selected for deferring compliance with the clean fuels program during the emergency deferral:

        i. Temporarily adjusting the scheduled applicable carbon intensity standard to a standard identified in the order that better reflects the availability of credits during the emergency deferral and requiring regulated parties to comply with the temporary standard;

        ii. Allowing for the carryover of deficits accrued during the emergency deferral into the next compliance period without penalty; or

        iii. Suspending deficit accrual during the emergency deferral period.

4. An emergency deferral may be terminated prior to the expiration date of the emergency deferral if new information becomes available indicating that the shortage that provided the basis for the emergency deferral has ended. The director of the department shall consult with the department of commerce and the governor's office in making an early termination decision. Termination of an emergency deferral is effective 15 calendar days after the date that the order declaring the termination is adopted.

5. [Empty]

    a. In addition to the emergency deferral specified in subsection (1) of this section, the department may issue a full or partial deferral for one calendar quarter of a person's obligation to furnish credits for compliance under section 4 of this act if it finds that the person is unable to comply with the requirements of this chapter due to reasons beyond the person's reasonable control. The department may initiate a deferral under this subsection at its own discretion or at the request of a person regulated under this chapter. The department may renew issued deferrals. In evaluating whether to issue a deferral under this subsection, the department may consider the results of the fuel supply forecast in section 11 of this act, but is not bound in its decision-making discretion by the results of the forecast.

    b. If the department issues a deferral pursuant to this subsection, the department may:

        i. Direct the person subject to the deferral to file a progress report on achieving full compliance with the requirements of this chapter within an amount of time determined to be reasonable by the department; and

        ii. Direct the person to take specific actions to achieve full compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

    c. The issuance of a deferral under this subsection does not permanently relieve the deferral recipient of the obligation to comply with the requirements of this chapter.


## Section 14
1. The department may require that persons that are required or elect to register or report under this chapter pay a fee. If the department elects to require program participants to pay a fee, the department must, after an opportunity for public review and comment, adopt rules to establish a process to determine the payment schedule and the amount of the fee charged. The amount of the fee must be set so as to equal but not exceed the projected direct and indirect costs to the department for developing and implementing the program and the projected direct and indirect costs to the department of commerce to carry out its responsibilities under section 11 of this act. The department and the department of commerce must prepare a biennial workload analysis and provide an opportunity for public review of and comment on the workload analysis. The department shall enter into an interagency agreement with the department of commerce to implement this section.

2. The clean fuels program account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from fees and penalties received under the program created in this chapter must be deposited into the account.
