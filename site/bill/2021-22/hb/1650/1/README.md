# House Bill 1650

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1650.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that commercial text messaging and robocalling are increasingly common practices employed by some businesses seeking to advertise or facilitate the sale of goods or services, and that such text messaging and robocalling are often an unwanted nuisance and invasion of privacy for many Washington residents. It is the intent of the legislature to: Clarify and strengthen the limitations on commercial text messaging and robocalling; reaffirm the requirement that a commercial text message or robocalling sender must first obtain clear and affirmative consent from recipients before sending such messages or robocalling; and expand the civil remedies available for violations of these provisions.

2. The legislature further finds that some entities use misleading text messaging and robocalling to deceive Washington residents and induce them into providing sensitive personal information, money, goods, or services. It is the intent of the legislature to expand the scope of existing "anti-phishing" provisions to include text messaging and robocalling, and efforts to obtain money, goods, and services, and to expand the civil remedies available for violations of these provisions.

3. It is the intent of the legislature to remove the limitations in RCW 19.190.090 (1) and (2), which currently restrict the private right of action created by the statute, such that a claim for damages can only be brought against a person or entity that violates RCW 19.190.080. As amended, the private right of action available under RCW 19.190.090 (1) and (2) will provide an additional remedy for any violation of chapter 19.190 RCW and supplement existing remedies available under the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

4. The legislature further finds that the most effective way to prevent robocalling practices that violate RCW 80.36.400 is to ensure that those calls never originate or enter the telecommunication network. Therefore, it is further the intent of the legislature to extend liability to those persons who provide substantial assistance or support in the origination and transmission of voice communications sent in violation of RCW 80.36.400.
