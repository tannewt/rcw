## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [28A.210](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.210_health—screening_and_requirements.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.210_health—screening_and_requirements.md) for context.

Public schools with students in any of grades kindergarten through eight may not require students to eat or drink outside school buildings. Students may opt in to eating or drinking outside when the outdoor temperature is 60 degrees or above and there is no precipitation. For the purpose of this section, "public schools" has the same meaning as in RCW 28A.150.010.
