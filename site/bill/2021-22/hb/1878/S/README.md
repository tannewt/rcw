1. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided otherwise by this section, each **public** school  that has an identified student percentage of at least **40** percent, **or an identified student percentage of less than 40 percent if authorized by federal law,** as determined annually by April 1st, must participate in the United States department of agriculture's community eligibility provision in the subsequent school year and throughout the duration of the community eligibility provision's four-year cycle.

    b. **School districts, to the extent practicable, shall group public schools for purposes of maximizing the number of public schools eligible to participate in the community eligibility provision. Individual schools participating in a group may have less than 40 percent identified students, provided the average identified student percentage for the group is at least 40 percent.**

2. **Public schools** that, through an arrangement with a local entity, provide meals to all students and at no costs to the students are exempt from the requirements of this section.

4. For the purposes of this section, "identified student" means a student who is directly certified for free school meals based on the student's participation in other means-tested assistance programs, and students who are categorically eligible for free school meals without an application and not subject to income verification.
