## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that Washington is one of the largest exporters of food and agricultural goods in the country. The legislature also recognizes that growing, cultivating, and harvesting the food that we all consume is significant and important work. The legislature also recognizes that farmworkers are unique. Often, farmworkers must contend with dangers in their work environment, such as pesticides, heat, heavy equipment, and other elements, and deal with challenges such as inadequate housing, minimal pay, and jobs of short duration.

2. The legislature intends to assess the needs of farmworkers in the state to help better serve and protect these unique workers we all depend upon.


## Section 2

    a. The Washington institute for public policy shall conduct a comprehensive study to assess specific needs, as provided in subsection (2) of this section, of farmworkers in the state in order to help policymakers determine whether those needs are or are not being met by state administered programs, policies, and statutes.

    c. As part of its information gathering, the institute must hear from farmworkers, either directly or through the nonprofit organizations, regarding farmworkers' experiences and working conditions.

    a. An examination of how the relevant state agencies coordinate with each other and federal agencies in administrating and enforcing the various laws, policies, and programs, and of the agencies' education and outreach to farmworkers regarding farmworkers' rights and protections.
