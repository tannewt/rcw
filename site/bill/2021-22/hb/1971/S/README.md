1. A special inspections plan detailing the testing of new smoke control systems must be included as part of the construction documents required when new smoke control systems are installed. The special inspections plan must meet the requirements of the International Building Code and any other requirements from the local authority. The engineer of record for the smoke control system shall prepare the special inspection plan.

6. A special inspector for periodic testing must be identified to perform or coordinate the special inspections during periodic testing. The special inspector for periodic testing may also serve as the integrated testing agent as stated in the national fire protection administration standard number 4, standard for integrated fire protection and life safety system testing, when smoke control testing is performed as part of integrated systems testing at the time of installation or periodic operational testing. The special inspector for periodic testing may also coordinate testing, assemble test reports and documentation, and provide these to the local authority upon request.
