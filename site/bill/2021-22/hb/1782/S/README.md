# Substitute House Bill 1782 as Recommended by Local Government

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1782-S.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that every Washington resident should have access to safe, healthy, secure, and affordable housing; and, that it is the responsibility of the state and all cities and counties to plan for all current and future residents within their jurisdictions of all income levels, races, and ethnicities to have such housing. As our state population grows, the legislature recognizes the need for the state's housing supply to grow and adapt to meet the needs of all households, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, country of origin, or income, including families with children, seniors, and people who have a disability.

The legislature finds that adding a built environment subelement to comprehensive plans is desirable as the legislature mandates increasing density for middle housing, particularly in larger cities, pursuant to this act, in order to protect and improve the physical and mental health of communities with less access to open space and tree canopy, reduce health risks of extreme heat events related to climate change, or reduce disproportionately higher risks of exposure to air pollution or other environmental contaminants.

The legislature finds that it has duties under existing statutes, including chapter 36.70A RCW, to provide funding for all cities and counties to plan for new required elements of comprehensive plans including, but not limited to, planning for affordable housing and meeting the goals of the state in reducing our contribution to climate change. The legislature recognizes that it has been difficult to project what the costs may be of planning for new elements pursuant to this act. It is the intent of the legislature that the evaluation provided for in RCW 36.70A.190, and updates to it periodically thereafter, shall determine what constitutes adequate funding for planning for new elements of comprehensive plans and for the adoption of implementing ordinances and development regulations pursuant to chapter 36.70A RCW for future comprehensive plan updates.

    d. Limited areas of more intensive rural development. Subject to the requirements of this subsection and except as otherwise specifically provided in this subsection (5)(d), the rural element may allow for limited areas of more intensive rural development, including necessary public facilities and public services to serve the limited area as follows:

        i. Rural development consisting of the infill, development, or redevelopment of existing commercial, industrial, residential, or mixed-use areas, whether characterized as shoreline development, villages, hamlets, rural activity centers, or crossroads developments.

(A) A commercial, industrial, residential, shoreline, or mixed-use area are subject to the requirements of (d)(iv) of this subsection, but are not subject to the requirements of (c)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection.

(B) Any development or redevelopment other than an industrial area or an industrial use within a mixed-use area or an industrial area under this subsection (5)(d)(i) must be principally designed to serve the existing and projected rural population.

(C) Any development or redevelopment in terms of building size, scale, use, or intensity shall be consistent with the character of the existing areas. Development and redevelopment may include changes in use from vacant land or a previously existing use so long as the new use conforms to the requirements of this subsection (5);

        ii. The intensification of development on lots containing, or new development of, small-scale recreational or tourist uses, including commercial facilities to serve those recreational or tourist uses, that rely on a rural location and setting, but that do not include new residential development.

Public services and public facilities shall be limited to those necessary to serve the recreation or tourist use and shall be provided in a manner that does not permit low-density sprawl;

        iii. The intensification of development on lots containing isolated nonresidential uses or new development of isolated cottage industries and isolated small-scale businesses that are not principally designed to serve the existing and projected rural population and nonresidential uses, but do provide job opportunities for rural residents. Rural counties may allow the expansion of small-scale businesses as long as those small-scale businesses conform with the rural character of the area as defined by the local government according to RCW 36.70A.030(27). Rural counties may also allow new small-scale businesses to utilize a site previously occupied by an existing business as long as the new small-scale business conforms to the rural character of the area as defined by the local government according to RCW 36.70A.030(27). Public services and public facilities shall be limited to those necessary to serve the isolated nonresidential use and shall be provided in a manner that does not permit low-density sprawl;

        iv. A county shall adopt measures to minimize and contain the existing areas or uses of more intensive rural development, as appropriate, authorized under this subsection. Lands included in such existing areas or uses shall not extend beyond the logical outer boundary of the existing area or use, thereby allowing a new pattern of low-density sprawl. Existing areas are those that are clearly identifiable and contained and where there is a logical boundary delineated predominately by the built environment, but that may also include undeveloped lands if limited as provided in this subsection. The county shall establish the logical outer boundary of an area of more intensive rural development. In establishing the logical outer boundary, the county shall address (A) the need to preserve the character of existing natural neighborhoods and communities, (B) physical boundaries, such as bodies of water, streets and highways, and land forms and contours, (C) the prevention of abnormally irregular boundaries, and (D) the ability to provide public facilities and public services in a manner that does not permit low-density sprawl;

    v. For purposes of (d) of this subsection, an existing area or existing use is one that was in existence:

(A) On July 1, 1990, in a county that was initially required to plan under all of the provisions of this chapter;

(B) On the date the county adopted a resolution under RCW 36.70A.040(2), in a county that is planning under all of the provisions of this chapter under RCW 36.70A.040(2); or

(C) On the date the office of financial management certifies the county's population as provided in RCW 36.70A.040(5), in a county that is planning under all of the provisions of this chapter pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040(5).

    e. Exception. This subsection shall not be interpreted to permit in the rural area a major industrial development or a master planned resort unless otherwise specifically permitted under RCW 36.70A.360 and 36.70A.365.

6. A transportation element that implements, and is consistent with, the land use element.

    a. The transportation element shall include the following subelements:

        i. Land use assumptions used in estimating travel;

        ii. Estimated traffic impacts to state-owned transportation facilities resulting from land use assumptions to assist the department of transportation in monitoring the performance of state facilities, to plan improvements for the facilities, and to assess the impact of land-use decisions on state-owned transportation facilities;

        iii. Facilities and services needs, including:

(A) An inventory of air, water, and ground transportation facilities and services, including transit alignments and general aviation airport facilities, to define existing capital facilities and travel levels as a basis for future planning. This inventory must include state-owned transportation facilities within the city or county's jurisdictional boundaries;

(B) Level of service standards for all locally owned arterials and transit routes to serve as a gauge to judge performance of the system. These standards should be regionally coordinated;

(C) For state-owned transportation facilities, level of service standards for highways, as prescribed in chapters 47.06 and 47.80 RCW, to gauge the performance of the system. The purposes of reflecting level of service standards for state highways in the local comprehensive plan are to monitor the performance of the system, to evaluate improvement strategies, and to facilitate coordination between the county's or city's six-year street, road, or transit program and the office of financial management's ten-year investment program. The concurrency requirements of (b) of this subsection do not apply to transportation facilities and services of statewide significance except for counties consisting of islands whose only connection to the mainland are state highways or ferry routes. In these island counties, state highways and ferry route capacity must be a factor in meeting the concurrency requirements in (b) of this subsection;

(D) Specific actions and requirements for bringing into compliance locally owned transportation facilities or services that are below an established level of service standard;

(E) Forecasts of traffic for at least ten years based on the adopted land use plan to provide information on the location, timing, and capacity needs of future growth;

(F) Identification of state and local system needs to meet current and future demands. Identified needs on state-owned transportation facilities must be consistent with the statewide multimodal transportation plan required under chapter 47.06 RCW;

        iv. Finance, including:

(A) An analysis of funding capability to judge needs against probable funding resources;

(B) A multiyear financing plan based on the needs identified in the comprehensive plan, the appropriate parts of which shall serve as the basis for the six-year street, road, or transit program required by RCW 35.77.010 for cities, RCW 36.81.121 for counties, and RCW 35.58.2795 for public transportation systems. The multiyear financing plan should be coordinated with the ten-year investment program developed by the office of financial management as required by RCW 47.05.030;

(C) If probable funding falls short of meeting identified needs, a discussion of how additional funding will be raised, or how land use assumptions will be reassessed to ensure that level of service standards will be met;

    v. Intergovernmental coordination efforts, including an assessment of the impacts of the transportation plan and land use assumptions on the transportation systems of adjacent jurisdictions**. The comprehensive plan shall describe how the city or county will ensure that the transit frequency that is relied on in the plan, development regulations, and permitting decisions is going to be continued undiminished, including any interlocal agreements with transit providers that will be utilized. For any area where such transit frequency is not reasonably assured, the level of required density or mix of housing required by this section is not required to be increased beyond what would be required if the transit was not present**;

    vi. Demand-management strategies;

    vii. Pedestrian and bicycle component to include collaborative efforts to identify and designate planned improvements for pedestrian and bicycle facilities and corridors that address and encourage enhanced community access and promote healthy lifestyles.

    b. After adoption of the comprehensive plan by jurisdictions required to plan or who choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, local jurisdictions must adopt and enforce ordinances which prohibit development approval if the development causes the level of service on a locally owned transportation facility to decline below the standards adopted in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan, unless transportation improvements or strategies to accommodate the impacts of development are made concurrent with the development. These strategies may include increased public transportation service,  programs, demand management, and other transportation systems management strategies. For the purposes of this subsection (6), "concurrent with the development" means that improvements or strategies are in place at the time of development, or that a financial commitment is in place to complete the improvements or strategies within six years. If the collection of impact fees is delayed under RCW 82.02.050(3), the six-year period required by this subsection (6)(b) must begin after full payment of all impact fees is due to the county or city.

    c. The transportation element described in this subsection (6), the six-year plans required by RCW 35.77.010 for cities, RCW 36.81.121 for counties, and RCW 35.58.2795 for public transportation systems, and the ten-year investment program required by RCW 47.05.030 for the state, must be consistent.

7. An economic development element establishing local goals, policies, objectives, and provisions for economic growth and vitality and a high quality of life. A city that has chosen to be a residential community is exempt from the economic development element requirement of this subsection.

8. A park and recreation element that implements, and is consistent with, the capital facilities plan element as it relates to park and recreation facilities. The element shall include: (a) Estimates of park and recreation demand for at least a ten-year period; (b) an evaluation of facilities and service needs; and (c) an evaluation of intergovernmental coordination opportunities to provide regional approaches for meeting park and recreational demand.

9. It is the intent that new or amended elements required after January 1, 2002, be adopted concurrent with the scheduled update provided in RCW 36.70A.130. Requirements to incorporate any such new or amended elements shall be null and void until funds sufficient to cover applicable local government costs are appropriated and distributed by the state at least two years before local government must update comprehensive plans as required in RCW 36.70A.130.


## Section 5
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [36.70A](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

1. [Empty]

    a. Any city planning under RCW 36.70A.040 that has a population of 20,000 or more as of the effective date of this section, or any city that is determined by the office of financial management pursuant to RCW 43.62.030 to have a population of 20,000 or more at least one year prior to its next comprehensive plan update, must authorize the development of all middle housing types on all lots exceeding 4,500 square feet zoned for detached single-family residential use and within one-half mile, based on walking distance, of a major transit stop. If a city adopts a maximum of four residential units per lot within one-half mile of a major transit stop, it may consider a detached accessory dwelling unit as one of the units.

    b. Cities subject to the requirements of (a) of this subsection must also allow development of duplexes and attached and detached accessory dwelling units on all other lots exceeding 4,500 square feet zoned for single-family residential use, and for the development of triplexes on corner lots exceeding 5,000 square feet. Cities may limit development on such lots to a total of two detached residential units per lot inclusive of either duplexes or detached accessory dwelling units on noncorner lots, and to a total of three detached residential units or a triplex per lot on corner lots.

2. [Empty]

    a. As an alternative to the requirements in subsection (1) of this section, cities may alter local zoning to allow an average minimum net density equivalent to 33 dwelling units per acre within one-half mile of a major transit stop, based on walking distance.

    b. In determining net density for housing within one-half mile of a major transit stop a city may exclude sensitive or critical areas, dedicated open space, schools, bodies of water, or lands which are not buildable to the level of density otherwise required.

    c. Any city choosing to adopt an average minimum density pursuant to (a) of this subsection shall also adopt findings of fact demonstrating that the actions taken to implement the average minimum density will not result in racially disparate impacts, displacement, or further exclusion in housing. The city shall transmit such findings to the department.

3. When providing for the required middle housing types as required in subsection (1) of this section or for the minimum net density as required in subsection (2) of this section, the city shall ensure that multifamily housing within such areas includes sufficient units to meet the projections of housing needed within the planning horizon for families and households of various sizes and income levels.

4. Any city with a population of between 10,000 and 20,000 as of the effective date of this section, or any city determined by the office of financial management pursuant to RCW 43.62.030 to have a population between 10,000 and 20,000 at least one year prior to its next comprehensive plan update, must authorize the development of duplexes on all lots exceeding 4,500 square feet which are zoned for detached single-family residential use that do not have an accessory dwelling unit on the lot.

5. [Empty]

    a. Any city with a population over 100,000 may not require the inclusion of off-street parking as a condition for the construction of middle housing within one-half mile of a major transit stop, unless the street on which the construction will occur has no on-street parking.

    b. Any city with a population between 20,000 and 100,000 may not require more than one off-street parking spot on a lot within one-half mile of a major transit stop for every three bedrooms on the lot, unless the street on which the lot is located has no on-street parking.

6. [Empty]

    a. Outside of the limitations in this section, a city may apply all otherwise applicable regulations for the development of middle housing, including regulations for health, safety, or environment.

    b. Cities may adopt development and design standards related to the siting and design of middle housing. Such development and design standards may not discourage the development of middle housing through unreasonable costs, fees, delays, or other requirements or actions which individually or cumulatively make impracticable the permitting, siting, or construction of middle housing, provided that this subsection does not limit the amount of affordable housing that a city may require to be provided, either on-site or through an in-lieu payment, pursuant to a program enacted under RCW 36.70A.540. A city may not require zoning, development, siting, or design review standards for middle housing that are more restrictive than those required for detached single-family residences and the same development permit and environmental review processes that apply to detached single-family residences shall be applied to middle housing.

7. Nothing in this section prohibits a city from permitting detached single-family residences.


## Section 6
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [36.70A](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

1. Any city subject to the requirements under section 5 of this act may apply to the department for, and the department may certify, an extension of the implementation timelines.

2. An extension certified under this section may be applied only to specific areas where a city has identified water, sewer, stormwater, or transportation services that are currently deficient, or are expected to be deficient within the next five years, and for which the local government has established a plan of actions that will remedy the deficiency in those services on a specific timeline. The department may certify additional extensions of a city's remediation timeline.

3. For any subarea or community of interest within the jurisdiction for which the city or county finds that the increases in housing density required under section 5 of this act may create a significant risk of displacement of lower or moderate-income residents, reducing racial and economic integration, or of not meeting goals to increase affordable housing near transit, the city or county may apply to the department for flexibility in implementation for a limited period of time not to exceed one year.

4. The department may establish by rule any procedures necessary to implement this section.


## Section 7
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [64.38](/rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.38_homeowners_associations.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.38_homeowners_associations.md) for context.

Governing documents of associations within cities subject to the middle housing and density requirements of this act that are created after the effective date of this section may not prohibit the construction or development of the types of housing or density requirements that must be permitted by this act within such cities.


## Section 8
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [64.90](/rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.90_washington_uniform_common_interest_ownership_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/64_real_property_and_conveyances/64.90_washington_uniform_common_interest_ownership_act.md) for context.

Declarations and governing documents of a common interest community within cities subject to the middle housing and density requirements of this act that are created after the effective date of this section may not prohibit the construction or development of the types of housing or density requirements that must be permitted by this act within such cities.


## Section 9
If specific funding for the purposes of this act, referencing this act by bill or chapter number, is not provided by June 30, 2022, in the omnibus appropriations act, this act is null and void.
