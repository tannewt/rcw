## Section 5
1. A law enforcement agency may not acquire or use any military equipment.

## Section 6
All law enforcement agencies shall adopt policies and procedures to ensure that uniformed peace officers while on duty and in the performance of their official duties are reasonably identifiable.

    b. The pursuit is necessary for the purpose of identifying or apprehending the person;

    c. Under the circumstances, the safety risks of failing to apprehend or identify the person are considered to be greater than the safety risks associated with the vehicular pursuit;
