## Section 1
This act shall be known and cited as the nothing about us without us act.


## Section 2
1. The legislature recognizes that people with disabilities are often left out of the policy decisions that affect them most. Disabled people have lived experience navigating societal barriers and are therefore best equipped to find solutions through these barriers. According to the department of social and health services, approximately 13 percent of state residents live with a disability. People with disabilities face greater hardships finding and maintaining employment that pays a living wage, attaining higher education, and finding places to live. The poverty rate for disabled people in Washington is 20 percent, which is nearly twice the rate for people without disabilities. In addition, people with disabilities are employed at less than half the rate of people without disabilities. Because disabled people make less money, and their income is often supplemented by the government, they may have trouble finding places to live. Additionally, affordable housing is not always accessible housing. People with disabilities know these struggles firsthand, so it is essential that they have the opportunity to participate in and guide decision-making processes.

2. The legislature finds people with disabilities are almost entirely unrepresented in policy making. A governing body that makes decisions about disability, cannot do so effectively without the voices of that group present.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to ensure meaningful participation from disabled people on each task force, select committee, work group, advisory committee, or other statutory entity that makes decisions affecting disabled people. When people with disabilities have a seat at the table, Washington thrives.


## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [44.04](/rcw/44_state_government—legislative/44.04_general_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/44_state_government—legislative/44.04_general_provisions.md) for context.

1. The membership of any task force, select committee, work group, advisory committee, or other statutory entity whose activities are related to issues directly involving individuals with disabilities must reflect the diversity of people with lived experience with disabilities, including members with differing cultural and economic circumstances.

2. Membership must consist of at least three people with disabilities who have experience with the identified issue being addressed by the group. This requirement includes participation by three people with intellectual and developmental disabilities when the issues being addressed directly relate to services or conditions relating to such persons.

3. No members are required to be added to an entity so long as its membership is in compliance with subsection (1) of this section.
