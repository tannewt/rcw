1. A court of this state shall treat a foreign country as if it were a state of the United States for the purpose of applying Articles 1 and 2.

3. A court of this state need not apply this chapter if the child custody law of a foreign country violates fundamental principles of human rights.

4. **A court of this state need not apply this chapter if the law of a foreign country holds that apostasy, or a sincerely held religious belief or practice, or homosexuality are punishable by death, and a parent or child may be at demonstrable risk of being subject to such laws. For the purposes of this subsection, "apostasy" means the abandonment or renunciation of a religious or political belief.**
