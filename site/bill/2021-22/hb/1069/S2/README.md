## Section 1
The legislature finds that the COVID-19 pandemic, as recognized by emergency proclamations issued by the governor, has resulted in an unprecedented drop in local government revenues.

## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [82.14.310](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.14_local_retail_sales_and_use_taxes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.14_local_retail_sales_and_use_taxes.md) for context.

1. The county criminal justice assistance account is created in the state treasury. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the county criminal justice assistance account from the general fund the sum of **$23,200,000** divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1. For each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer must increase the total transfer by the fiscal growth factor, as defined in RCW 43.135.025, forecast for that fiscal year by the office of financial management in November of the preceding year.

2. The moneys deposited in the county criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section, less any moneys appropriated for purposes under subsections (4) and (5) of this section, must be distributed at such times as distributions are made under RCW 82.44.150 and on the relative basis of each county's funding factor as determined under this subsection.

    a. A county's funding factor is the sum of:

        i. The population of the county, divided by **1,000**, and multiplied by two-tenths;

        ii. The crime rate of the county, multiplied by three-tenths; and

        iii. The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court, for each **1,000** in population, multiplied by five-tenths.

    b. Under this section and RCW 82.14.320 and 82.14.330:

        i. The population of the county or city is as last determined by the office of financial management;

        ii. The crime rate of the county or city is the annual occurrence of specified criminal offenses, as calculated in the most recent annual report on crime in Washington state as published by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, for each **1,000** in population;

        iii. The annual number of criminal cases filed in the county superior court must be determined by the most recent annual report of the courts of Washington, as published by the administrative office of the courts;

        iv. Distributions and eligibility for distributions in the 1989-1991 biennium must be based on 1988 figures for both the crime rate as described under (ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (iii) of this subsection. Future distributions must be based on the most recent figures for both the crime rate as described under (ii) of this subsection and the annual number of criminal cases that are filed as described under (iii) of this subsection.

3. Moneys distributed under this section must be expended exclusively for criminal justice purposes **.****Except after the effective date of this section through December 31, 2023, these funds** may not be used to replace or supplant existing funding. Criminal justice purposes are defined as activities that substantially assist the criminal justice system, which may include circumstances where ancillary benefit to the civil or juvenile justice system occurs, and which includes (a) domestic violence services such as those provided by domestic violence programs, community advocates, and legal advocates, as defined in RCW 70.123.020, and (b) during the 2001-2003 fiscal biennium, juvenile dispositional hearings relating to petitions for at-risk youth, truancy, and children in need of services. Existing funding for purposes of this subsection is defined as calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes. Calendar year 1989 actual operating expenditures for criminal justice purposes exclude the following: Expenditures for extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions for criminal justice services, beyond the control of the local jurisdiction receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.

4. Not more than five percent of the funds deposited to the county criminal justice assistance account may be available for appropriations for enhancements to the state patrol crime laboratory system and the continuing costs related to these enhancements. Funds appropriated from this account for such enhancements may not supplant existing funds from the state general fund.

5. During the 2017-2019 fiscal biennium, the sum of **$153,000**, and during the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium, the sum of **$510,000**, may be appropriated for the Washington state patrol to provide investigative assistance and report services to assist local law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminals. It is the intent of the legislature that this policy will be continued in subsequent fiscal biennia.

1. The municipal criminal justice assistance account is created in the state treasury. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, the state treasurer must transfer into the municipal criminal justice assistance account for distribution under this section from the general fund the sum of **$4,600,000** divided into four equal deposits occurring on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1.

No city may receive more than **50** percent of any moneys distributed under this subsection (a) but, if a city distribution is reduced as a result of exceeding the **50** percent limitation, the amount not distributed must be distributed under (b) of this subsection.

    b. The remainder of the moneys, including any moneys not distributed in subsection (2)(a) of this section, must be distributed to all cities eligible under subsection (2) of this section ratably based on population as last determined by the office of financial management.

Cities that subsequently qualify for this distribution must notify the department of commerce by November 30th for the upcoming calendar year. The department of commerce must provide a list of eligible cities to the state treasurer by December 31st. The state treasurer must modify the distribution of these funds in the following year.

Any election held pursuant to this section shall be held not more than **12** months prior to the date on which the proposed levy is to be made, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The ballot of the proposition shall state the dollar rate proposed and shall clearly state the conditions, if any, which are applicable under subsection (4) of this section.

2. [Empty]

    a. Subject to statutory dollar limitations, a proposition placed before the voters under this section may authorize annual increases in levies for multiple consecutive years, up to six consecutive years, during which period each year's authorized maximum legal levy shall be used as the base upon which an increased levy limit for the succeeding year is computed, but the ballot proposition must state the dollar rate proposed only for the first year of the consecutive years and must state the limit factor, or a specified index to be used for determining a limit factor, such as the consumer price index, which need not be the same for all years, by which the regular tax levy for the district may be increased in each of the subsequent consecutive years. Elections for this purpose must be held at a primary or general election. The title of each ballot measure must state the limited purposes for which the proposed annual increases during the specified period of up to six consecutive years shall be used.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (2)(b), funds raised by a levy under this subsection may not supplant existing funds used for the limited purpose specified in the ballot title. For purposes of this subsection, existing funds means the actual operating expenditures for the calendar year in which the ballot measure is approved by voters. Actual operating expenditures excludes lost federal funds, lost or expired state grants or loans, extraordinary events not likely to reoccur, changes in contract provisions beyond the control of the taxing district receiving the services, and major nonrecurring capital expenditures.

        ii. The supplanting limitations in (b)(i) of this subsection do not apply to levies approved by the voters in calendar years 2009, 2010,  2011, **2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022,** in any county with a population of **1,500,000** or more. This subsection (2)(b)(ii) only applies to levies approved by the voters after July 26, 2009.

        iii. The supplanting limitations in (b)(i) of this subsection do not apply to levies approved by the voters in calendar year 2009 and thereafter in any county with a population less than **1,500,000**. This subsection (2)(b)(iii) only applies to levies approved by the voters after July 26, 2009.

3. After a levy authorized pursuant to this section is made, the dollar amount of such levy may not be used for the purpose of computing the limitations for subsequent levies provided for in this chapter, unless the ballot proposition expressly states that the levy made under this section will be used for this purpose.

4. If expressly stated, a proposition placed before the voters under subsection (1) or (2) of this section may:

    a. Use the dollar amount of a levy under subsection (1) of this section, or the dollar amount of the final levy under subsection (2) of this section, for the purpose of computing the limitations for subsequent levies provided for in this chapter;

    b. Limit the period for which the increased levy is to be made under (a) of this subsection;

    c. Limit the purpose for which the increased levy is to be made under (a) of this subsection, but if the limited purpose includes making redemption payments on bonds;

        i. For the county in which the state capitol is located, the period for which the increased levies are made may not exceed **25** years; and

        ii. For districts other than a district under (c)(i) of this subsection, the period for which the increased levies are made may not exceed nine years;

    d. Set the levy or levies at a rate less than the maximum rate allowed for the district;

    e. Provide that the exemption authorized by RCW 84.36.381 will apply to the levy of any additional regular property taxes authorized by voters; or

    f. Include any combination of the conditions in this subsection.

5. Except as otherwise expressly stated in an approved ballot measure under this section, subsequent levies shall be computed as if:

    a. The proposition under this section had not been approved; and

    b. The taxing district had made levies at the maximum rates which would otherwise have been allowed under this chapter during the years levies were made under the proposition.
