1. For a felony conviction in a Washington state court, the right to vote is **automatically** restored as long as the person is not **serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction** of the department of corrections. For a felony conviction in a federal court or any state court other than a Washington state court, the right to vote is **automatically** restored as long as the person is no longer incarcerated. **A person who has been convicted of a felony and is either sentenced to a term of total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections or otherwise incarcerated as provided for in this subsection must reregister to vote prior to voting.**

2.

At least **once a month**, the secretary of state shall compare the list of registered voters to a list of **persons** who are not eligible to vote as provided in subsection (1)  of this section. If a registered voter is not eligible to vote as provided in this section, the secretary of state or county auditor shall confirm the match through a date of birth comparison and suspend the voter registration from the official state voter registration list. The secretary of state or county auditor shall send to the person at his or her last known voter registration address and at the department of corrections, if the person is **serving a sentence of total confinement under the jurisdiction** of the department, a notice of the proposed cancellation and an explanation of the requirements for  restoring the right to vote and reregistering. To the extent possible, the secretary of state shall time the comparison required by this subsection to allow notice and cancellation of voting rights for ineligible voters prior to a primary or general election.

3. For the purposes of this section,

a sentence of **total** confinement

**does not include confinement imposed as a sanction for a community custody violation under RCW 9.94A.633(1)**.
