        iii. A law enforcement or corrections agency may require any person requesting a body worn camera recording pursuant to this subsection (14)(e) to identify himself or herself to ensure he or she is a person entitled to obtain the body worn camera recording under this subsection (14)(e).

        i. **Notwithstanding (a) and (e) of this subsection, an agency may provide an unredacted copy of body worn camera recordings to a defendant's attorney in a criminal matter without the disclosure being considered highly offensive, if the defendant's attorney would otherwise be entitled to receive an unredacted copy in the course of discovery in a criminal matter. The attorney receiving the unredacted copy shall sign a written agreement that the attorney will maintain exclusive custody of the unredacted copy, use the unredacted copy only for the purposes of conducting the defendant's side of the criminal case as if it had been furnished in discovery, and treat the unredacted copy as confidential as a matter of law.

In any private cause of action resulting from improper redisclosure of the recordings, the attorney may not use the receipt of the recording under this subsection as a defense. A violation of the written agreement may also result in sanctions under the civil or criminal court rules.**
