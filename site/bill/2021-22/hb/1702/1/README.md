## Section 1
In 2019, Washington state set an ambitious statutory broadband internet connectivity goal that every residence and business have access to broadband with 150 megabits per second minimum download and upload speeds by 2028. When establishing that goal, the legislature observed that broadband is critical to full participation in society and the modern economy and recognized that reaching the goal would require additional and sustained investment, research, local and community participation, and public-private partnerships. In 2020, the legislature passed legislation recognizing that digital exclusion carries an immense societal and economic cost for Washingtonians, harming opportunities for economic success and exacerbating existing wealth and income gaps. In 2021, the legislature took steps to increase the authority of local governments to provide retail broadband service.

Given the critical functions that broadband serves and the inequity of digital exclusion, the legislature intends to use additional policy tools to enhance the private sector's ability to partner in reaching state goals. The legislature finds it appropriate to recognize the value and necessity of private sector telecommunications providers to accelerate broadband connectivity and rapid achievement of the state broadband goal.

First, the legislature finds that it would be helpful to support the emerging innovations in low earth orbit satellites, which is a technology that can provide the necessary broadband speed to rural residents who may lack a wireline or wireless option. Second, the legislature finds that it would facilitate more public-private partnerships and more affordable connectivity, to lower the cost of new wireline and wireless broadband connections through a business and occupation tax credit offered per new residential connection that meets Washington state service standards.
