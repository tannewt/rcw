## 47.66.010 - Legislative declaration.
There is significant state interest in assuring that viable multimodal transportation programs are available throughout the state. The legislature recognizes the need to create a mechanism to fund multimodal transportation programs and projects. The legislature further recognizes the complexities associated with current funding mechanisms and seeks to create a process that would allow for all transportation programs and projects to compete for limited resources.

## **47.66.030 - Regional mobility grants.**
1. [Empty]

    a. The department shall establish a regional mobility grant program. The purpose of the grant program is to aid local governments in funding projects such as intercounty connectivity service, park and ride lots, rush hour transit service, and capital projects that improve the connectivity and efficiency of our transportation system. The department shall identify cost-effective projects that reduce delay for people and goods and improve connectivity between counties and regional population centers. The department shall submit a prioritized list of all projects requesting funding to the legislature by December 1st of each year.

    b. Once the department has a prioritized list, pursuant to (a) of this subsection and RCW 47.66.040, of all projects requesting funding, the department shall reprioritize the projects in counties with a population of seven hundred thousand or more that border Puget Sound based on the same criteria used for the prioritized list as well as the additional criteria of coordination and integration. After this reprioritization, the department shall integrate these reprioritized projects with the prioritized projects from all other counties while ensuring that the prioritized projects from all other counties do not move to a lower relative position on this integrated list or, if a prioritized project from all other counties is in the funded portion of the prioritized list, out of the funded portion of this integrated list.

2. The department may establish an advisory committee to carry out the mandates of this chapter.

3. The department must report annually to the transportation committees of the legislature on the status of any grants projects funded by the program created under this section.

4. **During the 2021-2023 biennium, the department may not recommend or award funding to purchase car pool or van pool vehicles for the purposes of commute trip reduction.**

## **47.66.040 - Selection process—Local matching funds.**
1. The department shall select projects based on a competitive process. The competition shall be consistent with the following criteria:

    a. Local, regional, and state transportation plans;

    b. Local transit development plans; and

    c. Local comprehensive land use plans.

2. The following criteria shall be considered by the department in selecting programs and projects:

    a. Objectives of the growth management act, the high capacity transportation act, the commute trip reduction act, transportation demand management programs, federal and state air quality requirements, and federal Americans with Disabilities Act and related state accessibility requirements; and

    b. Enhancing the efficiency of regional corridors in moving people among jurisdictions and modes of transportation, energy efficiency issues, reducing delay for people and goods, freight and goods movement as related to economic development, regional significance, rural isolation, the leveraging of other funds, and safety and security issues.

3. The department shall determine the appropriate level of local match required for each project based on the source of funds. **The department may determine that no match is required for small cities and rural areas.**

4. **During the 2021-2023 biennium, the department may not recommend or award funding to purchase car pool or van pool vehicles for purposes of commute trip reduction.**

## 47.66.070 - Multimodal transportation account.
The multimodal transportation account is created in the state treasury. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only for transportation purposes.

\[ [2000 2nd sp.s. c 4 § 2](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6856-S2.SL.pdf?cite=2000%202nd%20sp.s.%20c%204%20§%202); \]

## 47.66.080 - Grant programs examination.
Beginning in 2005, and every other year thereafter, the department shall examine the division's existing grant programs, and the methods used to allocate grant funds, to determine the program's effectiveness, and whether the methods used to allocate funds result in an equitable distribution of the grants. The department shall submit a report of the findings to the transportation committees of the legislature.

\[ [2005 c 318 § 6](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/2124-S.SL.pdf?cite=2005%20c%20318%20§%206); \]

## **47.66.100 - Rural mobility grant program.**
1. The department shall establish a rural mobility grant program. The purpose of the grant program is to aid small cities and rural areas, as identified in the "Summary of Public Transportation ‑ 2008" published by the department or subsequent versions published by the department.

    a. Fifty percent of the money appropriated for the rural mobility grant program must go to noncompetitive grants that must be distributed to the transit systems serving small cities and rural areas in a manner similar to past disparity equalization programs.

    b. Fifty percent of the money appropriated for the rural mobility grant program must go to competitive grants to providers of rural mobility service in areas not served or underserved by transit agencies.

2. The department may establish an advisory committee to carry out the mandates of this section.

3. The department must report annually to the transportation committees of the legislature on the status of any grants projects funded by the program created under this section.

      ii. The benefit provided to transitioning the entire state to a transportation system with lower carbon intensity.

2. The department's public transportation division must establish an advisory committee to assist in identifying projects under subsection (1) of this section. The advisory committee must include representatives from the department of ecology, the department of commerce, the utilities and transportation commission, and at least one transit authority.

3. In order to receive green transportation capital grant program funding for a project, a transit authority must provide matching funding for that project that is at least equal to twenty percent of the total cost of the project.
