## Section 1
The legislature finds that service and overseas voters have the right to vote for their elected officials. To effectuate this right, service and overseas voters must have access to the same ballot materials as voters present in the state with sufficient time to thoughtfully consider candidates and issues before casting a ballot. Accordingly, the legislature intends to ensure that voters' pamphlets are distributed to service and overseas voters at the same time as the ballot.

The secretary of state shall, whenever at least one statewide measure or office is scheduled to appear on the general election ballot, print and distribute a voters' pamphlet.

The secretary of state shall distribute the voters' pamphlet to each household in the state, **to each household in which a service or overseas voter lives,** to public libraries, and to any other locations **the secretary** deems appropriate. The secretary of state shall also produce taped or Braille transcripts of the voters' pamphlet, publicize their availability, and mail without charge a copy to any person who requests one. **A pamphlet mailed to a service or overseas voter under this section must be sent at the same time as the ballot.**

The secretary of state may make the material required to be distributed by this chapter available to the public in electronic form.

The county auditor or city clerk, as appropriate, may choose to mail the pamphlet to each registered voter in each jurisdiction that has included information in the pamphlet, if in his or her judgment, a more economical and effective distribution of the pamphlet would result. **A pamphlet mailed to a service or overseas voter under this section must be sent at the same time as the ballot.**
