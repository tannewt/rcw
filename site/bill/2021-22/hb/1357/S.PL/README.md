## Section 1
The legislature finds that service and overseas voters have the right to vote for their elected officials. To effectuate this right, service and overseas voters must have access to the same ballot materials as voters present in the state with sufficient time to thoughtfully consider candidates and issues before casting a ballot. Accordingly, the legislature intends to ensure that voters' pamphlets are available to service and overseas voters at the same time as the ballot.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [29A.32.260](/rcw/29A_elections/29A.32_voters_pamphlets.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/29A_elections/29A.32_voters_pamphlets.md) for context.

As soon as practicable before the primary, special election, or general election, the county auditor, or if applicable, the city clerk of a first-class or code city, as appropriate, shall mail the local voters' pamphlet to every residence in each jurisdiction that has included information in the pamphlet. The county auditor or city clerk, as appropriate, may choose to mail the pamphlet to each registered voter in each jurisdiction that has included information in the pamphlet, if in his or her judgment, a more economical and effective distribution of the pamphlet would result. **The county auditor shall either mail or send a printable electronic version of the state and local voters' pamphlets to any service or overseas voter registered in the jurisdiction who has requested them.**


## Section 3
If specific funding for the purposes of this act, referencing this act by bill or chapter number, is not provided by June 30, 2022, in the omnibus appropriations act, this act is null and void.
