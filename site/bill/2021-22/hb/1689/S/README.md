For purposes of this section, "biomarker test" means a single or multigene diagnostic test of the cancer patient's biospecimen, such as tissue, blood, or other bodily fluids, for DNA, RNA, or protein alterations, including phenotypic characteristics of a malignancy, to identify an individual with a subtype of cancer, in order to guide patient treatment.
