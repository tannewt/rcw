## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [29A.60](/rcw/29A_elections/29A.60_canvassing.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/29A_elections/29A.60_canvassing.md) for context.

1. Not more than 45 days after the state election audit board members are appointed in accordance with section 1 of this act, the state election audit board shall enter into a contract with an impartial, nonpartisan, and bonded third-party audit vendor to conduct a forensic audit of the general election beginning in 2022 and for each general election thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of this section. The state election audit board may not contract with the same vendor to conduct the forensic audit more than one time every three years. The audit must be completed no later than 30 days after the date of the general election.

2. A forensic audit of the general election must include a manual hand count audit of all the ballots in the following precincts:

    a. Every precinct in the 10 counties with the largest population in the state; and

    b. For all other counties not included in (a) of this subsection, the county auditor of each county must randomly select by a public drawing at least 10 percent of the total precincts in their county to audit. Two weeks before the county auditor conducts the drawing of election precincts, the county auditor shall publish a notice announcing the drawing, including the date, time, and location of the drawing; a clearly stated purpose of the notice; and an invitation to the public to attend and observe the drawing. The notice must be prominently displayed and readily visible on the county auditor's website, or county website if the county auditor does not have one, and published in newspapers with the largest and, if applicable, second largest readership in the county and be of a size which occupies at least one-eighth of a page.

3. The following forensic audit procedures apply to all counties:

    a. Manual count of ballots. For counties described under subsection (2)(a) of this section, a manual hand count must be conducted of ballots cast in each precinct. For all other counties, manual hand counts must be conducted in precincts selected in accordance with subsection (2)(b) of this section. A manual hand count of each ballot by batch shall be conducted by the third-party audit vendor to ensure the ballots were properly counted and tallied. If the manual hand count total is different than the total from the vote tallying system, a second manual hand count of the ballots must occur. If the second manual hand count matches the first manual hand count, then that outcome must be used to certify the election. If the second manual hand count matches the total from the vote tallying system, then the total from the vote tallying system must be used to certify the election. If the second manual ballot hand count does not match the first manual ballot hand count or the total from the vote tallying system, then the state election audit board shall investigate the cause of the discrepancy and determine the accurate count of the votes before the date of the certification of the election.

    b. Voter registration database. (i) The third-party audit vendor shall audit the voter registration database and create a log of voter registrations added to the database, revisions made to existing voter information in the voter registration database, and cancellations of voter registrations, made between January 1st of the year being audited and the date the audit is commenced.

(D) A detailed description of the records in the voter registration database that were modified and how these records were modified; and

(E) The source of information relied upon to make the addition, revision, or cancellation. The third-party audit vendor shall verify the legitimacy of the source and check the database for any invalid entries, revisions, or cancellations.

        ii. The third-party audit vendor shall audit the voter registration database for any duplicate entries. Entries must be checked by a comparison of the name, date of birth, and valid state-issued identification number.

    c. Ballot reconciliation. (i) The third-party audit vendor shall manually hand count and review the count conducted under (a) of this subsection for validity and accuracy of the tally as part of the county ballot reconciliation process in this subsection (3)(c). In addition, the third-party audit vendor will reconcile the county's ballot totals including: Number of ballots produced, mailed, and received; absentee ballots requested, mailed, and received; provisional ballots issued and received; replacement ballots issued and received; damaged ballots received and duplicated; rejected ballots; and ballots counted daily.

        ii. To ensure a complete reconciliation of the election, the county auditor shall:

(A) Ensure ballots are printed using a paper stock that conforms to the manufacturer's recommendations and has been tested in each approved vote tabulation system used in the county. The county auditor shall keep a record of the paper stock amounts received and used. All paper stock must be fully accounted for and tracked to allow for easy identification of potential counterfeit ballots;

(B) Ensure all ballots contain an official watermark;

Fifty percent of each deposit is designated for the state auditor and 50 percent is designated, in equal amounts, for each county that submits an election expense reimbursement for the election. Expenditures from the account may be used to pay for the costs incurred by the state auditor or a county to perform election audit requirements under this title. Only the state auditor or their designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [29A.60.185](/rcw/29A_elections/29A.60_canvassing.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/29A_elections/29A.60_canvassing.md) for context.

1. **Prior to the certification of the general election, a full forensic audit of the general election must be conducted in accordance with section 2 of this act.**

2. Prior to certification of the **primary and special** election , the county auditor shall conduct an audit of duplicated ballots in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, and an audit using at minimum **two** of the following methods:

    a. An audit of results of votes cast on the direct recording electronic voting devices, or other in-person ballot marking systems, used in the county if there are races or issues with more than ten votes cast on all direct recording electronic voting devices or other in-person ballot marking systems in the county. This audit must be conducted by randomly selecting by lot up to **50** percent of the direct recording electronic voting devices or other in-person ballot marking systems, or one direct recording electronic voting device or other in-person ballot marking system, whichever is greater, and, for each device or system, comparing the results recorded electronically with the results recorded on paper. For purposes of this audit, the results recorded on paper must be tabulated as follows: On **50 percent** of the devices or systems selected for audit, the paper records must be tabulated manually; on the remaining devices or systems, the paper records may be tabulated by a mechanical device determined by the **state auditor** to be capable of accurately reading the votes cast and printed thereon and qualified for use in the state under applicable state and federal laws. **The mayoral contest with the most votes cast, one randomly selected local government council contest, and at least one additional randomly selected ballot contest** must be audited on each device or system. **If in any particular election there is no mayoral contest, the county auditor shall randomly select another local government council race to audit.** This audit procedure must be subject to observation **in accordance with subsection (6) of this section**. As used in this subsection, "in-person ballot marking system" or "system" means an in-person ballot marking system that retains or produces an electronic voting record of each vote cast using the system;

    b. A random check of the ballot counting equipment **for accuracy**;

    c. A risk-limiting audit. A "risk-limiting audit" means an audit protocol that makes use of statistical principles and methods **which produce the most accurate outcome and are consistent with the highest industry standards** and is designed to limit the risk of certifying an incorrect election outcome.

        i. **The state auditor shall set** the risk limit. A "risk limit" means the largest statistical probability that an incorrect reported tabulation outcome is not detected in a risk-limiting audit**.**

        ii. **The county auditor shall randomly** select for audit **the mayoral race with the most votes cast, one local government council race selected at random**, and  at least one ballot contest . The county auditor shall randomly select **another local government council race** for audit if in any particular election there is no **mayoral** contest**.**

        iii. **The state auditor shall establish** procedures for implementation of risk-limiting audits, including random selection of the audit sample, determination of audit size, and procedures for a comparison risk-limiting audit and ballot polling risk-limiting audit as defined in (c)(iii)(A) and (B) of this subsection. **The audit sample and size must be sufficiently large and consistent with industry best practices proven to yield accurate results.**

(A) In a comparison risk-limiting audit, the county auditor compares the voter markings on randomly selected ballots to the ballot-level cast vote record produced by the ballot counting equipment.

(B) In a ballot polling risk-limiting audit, the county auditor of a county using ballot counting equipment that does not produce ballot-level cast vote records reports the voter markings on randomly selected ballots until the prespecified risk limit is met; or

    d. An independent electronic audit of the original ballot counting equipment used in the county. The county auditor may either conduct an audit of all ballots cast, or limit the audit to **five percent of the** precincts or **12** batches pursuant to procedures **established by the state auditor**. This audit must be conducted using an independent electronic audit system that is, at minimum:

        i. Approved by the **state auditor**;

        ii. Completely independent from all voting systems, including ballot counting equipment, that is used in the county;

        iii. **Not connected to the internet, and incapable of connecting to any wireless, bluetooth, universal serial bus, or similar exterior drives which may compromise data;**

        iv. Distributed or manufactured by a vendor different from the vendor that distributed or manufactured the original ballot counting equipment; and

    v. Capable of demonstrating that it can verify and confirm the **logic and** accuracy of the original ballot counting equipment's reported results.

3. Prior to certification of the election, the county auditor must conduct an audit of ballots duplicated under RCW 29A.60.125. The audit of duplicated ballots must involve a comparison of the duplicated ballot to the original ballot. The **state auditor** must establish procedures for the auditing of duplicated ballots.

4. For each audit method **included in this section**, the **state auditor** must adopt procedures **no later than six months before the primary, general election, or special election** for expanding the audit to include additional ballots when an audit results in a discrepancy. The procedure must specify under what circumstances a discrepancy will lead to an audit of additional ballots, and the method to determine how many additional ballots will be selected. The **state auditor** shall **also** adopt procedures **no later than six months before the primary, general election, or special election for investigating** the cause of any discrepancy found during an audit**, which must include an investigation by the state election audit board for any discrepancies found in a general election**.

5. The **state auditor** must establish rules  to implement and administer the auditing methods in this section**which must include** public observation **in accordance with subsection (6) of this section** and **detailed** reporting requirements **to ensure proper transparency and accountability to the voters**.

6. **All audits performed pursuant to this section must be open to observation by the candidates on the ballot or the candidate's designated representatives, ballot issue representatives on file with the county auditor or the representatives' designees, and political party observers, and made available to a minimum of 20 county residents per day who have resided and been registered to vote in the county for at least 12 months prior to the election that is being audited. The county auditor shall notify the candidates, ballot issue representatives, and political party observers of the audit in writing at least two weeks prior to the audit. The county auditor shall publish a notice two weeks before each audit announcing the audit, including the date, time, and location of the audit; a clearly stated purpose; and an invitation to the public to attend and observe the audit.
