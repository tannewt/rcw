# House Bill 1846

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1846.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that data centers are a cornerstone for strong internet infrastructure that is critical to the continuing prosperity of Washington's vibrant digital economy.

2. The legislature further finds that the data center industry is experiencing explosive growth across the nation and the competition among states for data center investments has increased dramatically. A department of commerce study, 2018 State of the Data Center Industry, An Analysis of Washington's Competitiveness, found that data center growth in rural Washington is at the lower end of the growth rate experienced by other major competitive markets.

3. The legislature recognizes that rural county data center investments are necessary but insufficient for the state's total economy and competitiveness. Washington is the only state that restricts incentives geographically. As a result, data centers serving urban counties requiring higher performance and that offer colocation services for multiple tenants that foster technology ecosystems are lost to other states, particularly neighboring Oregon.

4. The legislature further finds that data centers are one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building. In addition, the legislature finds that it is imperative that the economic expansion of data centers not result in negative environmental impacts to the communities in which the data centers are located. To this end, the legislature encourages data centers to be good environmental stewards for their community through adopting practices to mitigate negative environmental impacts of data centers, such as the use of energy derived from renewable resources, redirecting waste heat for alternative uses, or other industrial symbiosis practices.

5. The legislature therefore intends to encourage additional investments in data technology facilities through expanding and extending the current sales and use tax exemption for rural county data centers and establishing a sales and use tax exemption pilot program for data centers in counties with populations over 800,000, which will in turn incentivize local economic development, increased local tax revenues, and construction and trade jobs across Washington through the development of additional data center facilities.


## Section 2
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 3, 4, 5, and 6, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 of this act). This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preferences. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

2. The legislature categorizes these sales and use tax exemptions on eligible server equipment and eligible power infrastructure equipment at eligible computer data centers as ones intended to: Induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a); improve industry competitiveness as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(b); create or retain jobs as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(c); and reduce structural inefficiencies in the tax structure as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(d).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to:

    a. Maintain and grow the existing data center sector in Washington state, and encourage development of new data center facilities and refurbishment of existing data centers, thereby increasing the competitiveness of Washington's tax structure, which will increase or maintain construction and trade job growth in rural areas, and increase local tax revenue streams.

    b. Improve industry competitiveness and to increase, create, or retain jobs in computer data centers in counties with a population over 800,000, as determined by the April 1, 2021, office of financial management population estimates, thereby increasing family wage jobs. It is the legislature's intent to establish a pilot program that would provide a sales and use tax exemption on eligible server equipment and power infrastructure installed in eligible computer data centers, charges made for labor and services rendered in respect to installing eligible server equipment, and for construction, installation, repair, alteration, or improvement of eligible power infrastructures in order to increase investment in data center construction, leasing, and other investment throughout rural counties and counties with a population over 800,000, as determined by the April 1, 2021, office of financial management population estimates, thereby growing employment in the technology industry while adding real and personal property to state and local property tax rolls, thereby increasing the county tax base.

4. The legislature intends to extend the expiration date of the tax preference if a review finds that the tax preference is (a) generating capital investment in new computer data centers, refurbished data centers, and existing data centers (e.g., replacement server equipment), (b) generating state and local tax collections from data center investment and operations, and (c) generating construction and trade jobs in the state. The review must factor in changing economic conditions.

5. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (4) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to any available data source, including data available from the department of revenue regarding rural county property tax assessments and employment data from the employment security department.
