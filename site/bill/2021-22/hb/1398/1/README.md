AFFIDAVIT OF COVID HARDSHIP AFFECTING PAYMENT OF RENT

The tenant must provide this signed document to the landlord within seven days of the date above.

I attest that the foregoing are true and correct:

1. I am unable to pay my regular monthly rent for one of the following reasons:

    a. Loss of income directly related to COVID.

    b. Extraordinary expenses directly related to health impacts of COVID.

    c. Child care responsibilities or responsibilities to care for an elderly, disabled, or sick family member directly related to COVID that limit my ability to earn income.

    d. Extraordinary costs for child care or attending to an elderly, disabled, or sick family member directly related to COVID.

2. My income is less than 130 percent of the area median income for the county where I reside. (If the landlord alleges you earn more than 130 percent of area median income for the county where the rental property is located, you must provide information supporting your claim of COVID hardship.)

3. A tenant completing the affidavit of COVID hardship must provide proof of hardship.

4. I have used best efforts to obtain all available government assistance for rent or housing.

5. I am using best efforts to make timely partial payments that are as close to the full payment as my circumstances may permit, taking into account other nondiscretionary expenses.

6. I understand that I must still pay rent or make a housing payment, and comply with other obligations that I may have under my tenancy, lease agreement, or similar contract. I further understand that fees, penalties, or interest for not paying rent or making a housing payment on time as required by my tenancy, lease agreement, or similar contract may still be charged or collected on rent due.

7. I further understand that failure to provide this notice to my housing provider may require payment in full for all payments not made from February 29, 2020, to present and may make me subject to eviction pursuant to state and local laws.
