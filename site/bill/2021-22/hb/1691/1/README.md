The department shall **adopt by rule an amount that will be calculated by multiplying the reasonable per barrel cleanup and damage cost of the spilled oil, times the worst case spill volume, as measured in barrels, calculated in the applicant's oil spill contingency plan approved under chapter 90.56 RCW. The requirements of this section do** not apply to an onshore or offshore facility owned or operated by the federal government or by the state or local government.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [88.40.030](/rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md).

2. **In addition to the options provided in subsection (1) of this section, the owner or operator of a vessel may demonstrate financial responsibility under this chapter through qualification as a self-insurer.**

## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [88.40.040](/rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md) for context.

1. **The owner or operator of a vessel is not required to demonstrate financial responsibility under this chapter prior to using any port or place in Washington or state waters** when necessary to avoid injury to the vessel's crew or passengers. Any vessel owner or operator that does not meet the financial responsibility requirements of this chapter and any rules prescribed thereunder or the federal oil pollution act of 1990 shall be reported by the department to the United States coast guard.

2. (a) **Upon notification of an oil spill or discharge or other potential liability by the owner or operator of a vessel or facility that holds a certificate of financial responsibility, the director must reevaluate the validity of the certificate of financial responsibility under this chapter. The director may suspend or revoke a certificate of financial responsibility if the director determines that, because of a spill, discharge, or other action or potential liability, the holder of the certificate is likely to no longer have the financial resources to both pay damages for the oil spill or discharge or other action or potential liability and have resources remaining available in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of this chapter.**

    b. **If a person holds a certificate of financial responsibility for more than one covered vessel or facility and a spill or spills occur from one or more of those vessels or facilities for which the director determines that the owner or operator may be liable for damages in an amount exceeding five percent of the financial resources reflected by the certificate, the certificate is immediately rendered inapplicable to any vessel or facility not associated with the spill.**

    c. **Upon a determination by the director under (b) of this subsection that a certificate has been rendered inapplicable to a vessel or facility as a result of a spill, the owner or operator of a facility or vessel required to obtain a certificate of financial responsibility under this chapter may receive a new certificate of financial responsibility from the director upon a demonstration to the satisfaction of the director the amount of financial ability required pursuant to this chapter, as well as the financial ability to pay all reasonably estimated anticipated damages that arise or have arisen from the spill or spills that have occurred.**

3. **An owner or operator of more than one vessel subject to the requirements of this chapter, more than one facility subject to the requirements of this chapter, or more than one vessel and facility subject to the requirements of this chapter, is only required to obtain a single certificate of financial responsibility that applies to all of the owner's or operator's vessels and facilities. The department must base the terms of such a certificate upon the vessel or facility that represents the greatest financial risk in the event of a spill.**


## Section 6
