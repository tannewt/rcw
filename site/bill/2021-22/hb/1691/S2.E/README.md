## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [88.40.025](/rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md) for context.

An onshore or offshore facility shall demonstrate financial responsibility in an amount determined by the department as necessary to compensate the state and affected **federally recognized Indian tribes,** counties**,** and cities for damages that might occur during a reasonable worst case spill of oil from that facility into the navigable waters of the state. The department shall **adopt a rule that considers** such matters as the **worst case** amount of oil that could be spilled **, as calculated in the applicant's oil spill contingency plan approved under chapter 90.56 RCW**, the cost of cleaning up the spilled oil, the frequency of operations at the facility, the damages that could result from the spill**,** and the commercial availability and affordability of financial responsibility. **In order to demonstrate financial responsibility as required under this section, the owner or operator of a facility must obtain a certificate of financial responsibility from the department. The requirements of this section do** not apply to an onshore or offshore facility owned or operated by the federal government or by the state or local government.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [88.40.030](/rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md) for context.

1. **The owner or operator of a vessel or facility that is required to demonstrate financial responsibility under this chapter may do so by any one of, or a combination of, the following methods acceptable to the department:**

    a. **Evidence of insurance;**

    b. **Surety bonds;**

    c. **Guaranty;**

    d. **Letter of credit;**

    e. **Certificates of deposit;**

    f. **Protection and indemnity club membership;**

    g. **A certificate evidencing compliance with the requirements of another state's financial responsibility requirements or federal financial responsibility requirements if the state or federal government requires a level of financial responsibility the same as or greater than that required under this chapter; or**

    h. **Other evidence of financial responsibility deemed acceptable by the department.**

2. **In addition to the options provided in subsection (1) of this section, the owner or operator of a vessel or facility may demonstrate financial responsibility under this chapter through qualification as a self-insurer. Rules adopted by the department that provide a self-insurance option for vessels and facilities must require the applicant to thoroughly demonstrate the security of the applicant's financial position, which may include a demonstration of a combination of the applicant's assets, cash flow, equity, liabilities, and bond ratings. The department may require a certificate applicant relying on qualification as a self-insurer to demonstrate a greater monetary amount of financial responsibility than is required of applicants relying on a form of financial responsibility described in subsection (1) of this section. In adopting rules pertaining to self-insurance requirements, the department must establish standards that are no less protective than the qualification standards for self-insurance established in other jurisdictions with similar programs as of January 1, 2022, and from which Washington imports significant volumes of oil or petroleum products or to which Washington exports significant volumes of oil or petroleum products.**

3. **Upon determining that the owner or operator of a vessel or facility has adequately demonstrated financial responsibility to the department, the department must issue a certificate of financial responsibility to the owner or operator of the vessel or facility.**

4. **Any bond filed with the department to demonstrate financial responsibility under this chapter must be issued by a bonding company authorized to do business in the United States.**

5. **A certificate of financial responsibility, or a certificate specified in subsection (1)(g) of this section, must** be kept on any covered vessel and filed with the department at least **24** hours before entry of the vessel into the navigable waters of the state. **The owner or operator of a** covered vessel **must notify the department but** is not required to file **a certificate of** financial responsibility **24** hours before entry of the vessel into the navigable waters of the state, if the vessel has filed documentation of financial responsibility with the federal government, and the level of financial responsibility required by the federal government is the same as or exceeds state requirements.

6. **A certificate of financial responsibility issued by the department under this chapter or otherwise used for compliance with this chapter may not have a term greater than two years.**


## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [88.40.040](/rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/88_navigation_and_harbor_improvements/88.40_transport_of_petroleum_products—financial_responsibility.md) for context.

1. **The owner or operator of a vessel is not required to demonstrate financial responsibility under this chapter prior to using any port or place in Washington or state waters** when necessary to avoid injury to the vessel's crew or passengers. Any vessel owner or operator that does not meet the financial responsibility requirements of this chapter and any rules prescribed thereunder or the federal oil pollution act of 1990 shall be reported by the department to the United States coast guard.

2. The department **may** enforce section 1016 of the federal oil pollution act of 1990 as authorized by section 1019 of the federal act.

3. [Empty]

    a. [Empty]

        i. **The holder of a certificate under this chapter must notify the director of an oil spill or discharge in state waters consistent with chapters 90.48 and 90.56 RCW.**

        ii. **The holder of a certificate of financial responsibility for more than one covered vessel or facility must notify the director if it experiences a spill or spill from a vessel or facility in another jurisdiction for which it may be liable and which may incur damages that exceed five percent of the financial resources reflected by the certificate.**

    b. **Upon notification of an oil spill or discharge or other potential liability by the owner or operator of a vessel or facility that holds a certificate of financial responsibility under (a) of this subsection, the director may reevaluate the validity of the certificate of financial responsibility under this chapter. The director must reevaluate the validity of a certificate of financial responsibility under this chapter upon notification of a spill for which the certificate holder may be liable and which may incur damages that exceed 15 percent of the financial resources reflected by the certificate. The director may suspend or revoke a certificate of financial responsibility if the director determines that, because of a spill, discharge, or other action or potential liability, the holder of the certificate is likely to no longer have the financial resources to both pay damages for the oil spill or discharge or other action or potential liability and have resources remaining available in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of this chapter, effective 10 days after its determination.**

    c. **Upon a determination by the director under (a) of this subsection that a certificate has been suspended or revoked as a result of a spill, the owner or operator of a facility or vessel required to obtain a certificate of financial responsibility under this chapter may receive a new certificate of financial responsibility from the director upon a demonstration to the satisfaction of the director the amount of financial ability required pursuant to this chapter, as well as the financial ability to pay all reasonably estimated anticipated damages that arise or have arisen from the spill or spills that have occurred. The department must expeditiously review any applications from owners or operators whose certificates have been suspended or revoked by the department under this section. The department may issue a temporary certificate of financial responsibility to an owner or operator whose certificate has previously been revoked or suspended in order to allow the owner or operator to continue to operate a facility or vessel while the department evaluates a pending application from the owner or operator for a new certificate.**

4. **An owner or operator of more than one vessel subject to the requirements of this chapter, more than one facility subject to the requirements of this chapter, or more than one vessel and facility subject to the requirements of this chapter, may:**

    a. **Obtain a single certificate of financial responsibility that applies to all of the owner's or operator's vessels and facilities. The department must base the terms of such a certificate upon the vessel or facility that represents the greatest financial risk in the event of a spill; or**

    b. **Obtain separate certificates that each apply to a subset of the owner's or operator's vessels or facilities, provided that each vessel or facility of the owner or operator is covered by at least one valid certificate.**
