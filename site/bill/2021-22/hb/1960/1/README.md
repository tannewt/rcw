## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [72.09](/rcw/72_state_institutions/72.09_department_of_corrections.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/72_state_institutions/72.09_department_of_corrections.md) for context.

An inmate may not be housed in a correctional facility that primarily houses persons of a different biological sex than that of the inmate if the inmate has previously been convicted of a sex offense as defined in RCW 9.94A.030 against a victim whose biological sex is the same as those persons who are primarily housed in that correctional facility.
