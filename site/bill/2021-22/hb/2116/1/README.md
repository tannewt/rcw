## Section 1
1. Plastic and styrofoam represent a disturbing trend in recent years: The prioritization of convenience and cost efficiency over environmental preservation. Our state is experiencing an overfill of landfills that leads to high levels of methane and carbon dioxide, dangerous greenhouse gases that facilitate climate change, in addition to rising costs for taxpayers. Compounding the effects on the environment, plastic and other forms of nonbiodegradable packaging are often found to contaminate bodies of water, threaten marine wildlife, and lead to an imbalance of the ecosystem.

2. The exponential growth of landfills places a growing economic burden on urban communities to bear the rising cost of these environmentally dangerous landfills coupled with the health impacts of climate change. The loss of marine wildlife will disproportionately affect food safety and coastal tourism, both sources of vital revenue for communities and cities.

3. The longer we delay definitive action to reduce nonbiodegradable waste, the more prevalent and entrenched the threat becomes, and the more costly it will be to protect and maintain the well-being of our citizens and communities against the harms of plastic and nonbiodegradable waste. If left unchecked, nonbiodegradable waste will lead to a decline in the health and prosperity of future generations, especially for coastal and urban communities.

4. According to Puget Sound keeper, in a study conducted in 2019-2020, it was found that from 69 samples taken from the area surrounding Puget Sound, all were found to have microplastics. Microplastics often facilitate:

    a. The spread of toxins like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, commonly found in coal, crude oil, and gasoline, and polychlorinated biphenyls, found in coolant liquids, oil-based paints, and fluorescent lights;

    b. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification of toxins that, according to studies by environment international, have been shown to be carcinogenic and mutagenic;

    c. Harm to the immune systems of animals, provided the size is smaller than five millimeters, which leads to viral infections and sometimes death.

5. The legislature has taken steps to understand and address the threats posed by nonbiodegradable packaging as science, studying its impact and effects, has continued to develop. With the passage of chapter 138, Laws of 2020, the legislature took steps to address the widespread issue of indiscriminate pollution of plastic bags in bodies of water throughout the state.

6. The legislature finds that avoiding the increase of nonbiodegradable waste is only possible if restrictions on its role in packaging are implemented. Repairing and eliminating the effects of nonbiodegradable waste in our environment will require mobilization across all levels of government and many economic sectors, including manufacturing and restaurants to reach a net zero increase of nonbiodegradable waste from packaging by 2030. Washington must therefore raise its standards for the widespread implementation of biodegradable alternatives in the next decade.

7. In strengthening Washington standards for the use of biodegradable materials in packaging, it is the intent of the legislature to pursue these limits in a way that: Reduces the burdens placed on vulnerable populations and highly impacted communities with long-term and short-term benefits and improvements to economic well-being, the environment, and public health.
