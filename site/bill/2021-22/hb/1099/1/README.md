## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [36.70A.020](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

The following goals are adopted to guide the development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations of those counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 **and, where specified, also guide the development of regional policies, plans, and strategies adopted under RCW 36.70A.210 and chapter 47.80 RCW**. The following goals are not listed in order of priority and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of guiding the development of comprehensive plans **,** development regulations**, and, where specified, regional plans, policies, and strategies**:

1. Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas where adequate public facilities and services exist or can be provided in an efficient manner.

2. Reduce sprawl. Reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development.

3. Transportation. Encourage efficient multimodal transportation systems that **help achieve statewide targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and per capita vehicle miles traveled, and** are based on regional priorities and coordinated with county and city comprehensive plans.

4. Housing. Encourage the availability of affordable housing to all economic segments of the population of this state, promote a variety of residential densities and housing types, and encourage preservation of existing housing stock.

5. Economic development. Encourage economic development throughout the state that is consistent with adopted comprehensive plans, promote economic opportunity for all citizens of this state, especially for unemployed and for disadvantaged persons, promote the retention and expansion of existing businesses and recruitment of new businesses, recognize regional differences impacting economic development opportunities, and encourage growth in areas experiencing insufficient economic growth, all within the capacities of the state's natural resources, public services, and public facilities.

6. Property rights. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation having been made. The property rights of landowners shall be protected from arbitrary and discriminatory actions.

7. Permits. Applications for both state and local government permits should be processed in a timely and fair manner to ensure predictability.

8. Natural resource industries. Maintain and enhance natural resource-based industries, including productive timber, agricultural, and fisheries industries. Encourage the conservation of productive forestlands and productive agricultural lands, and discourage incompatible uses.

9. Open space and recreation. Retain open space, enhance recreational opportunities, **enhance** fish and wildlife habitat, increase access to natural resource lands and water, and develop parks and recreation facilities.

10. Environment. Protect the environment and enhance the state's high quality of life, including air and water quality, and the availability of water.

11. Citizen participation and coordination. Encourage the involvement of citizens in the planning process and ensure coordination between communities and jurisdictions to reconcile conflicts.

12. Public facilities and services. Ensure that those public facilities and services necessary to support development shall be adequate to serve the development at the time the development is available for occupancy and use without decreasing current service levels below locally established minimum standards.

13. Historic preservation. Identify and encourage the preservation of lands, sites, and structures, that have historical or archaeological significance.

14. **Climate change. Ensure that comprehensive plans, development regulations, and regional policies, plans, and strategies under RCW 36.70A.210 and chapter 47.80 RCW adapt to and mitigate the effects of a changing climate, support state greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements and state vehicle miles traveled goals, prepare for climate impact scenarios, foster resiliency to climate impacts and natural hazards, and protect environmental, economic, human health, and safety.**


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [36.70A.480](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

1. For shorelines of the state, the goals and policies of the shoreline management act as set forth in RCW 90.58.020 are added as one of the goals of this chapter as set forth in RCW 36.70A.020 without creating an order of priority among the **15** goals. The goals and policies of a shoreline master program for a county or city approved under chapter 90.58 RCW shall be considered an element of the county or city's comprehensive plan. All other portions of the shoreline master program for a county or city adopted under chapter 90.58 RCW, including use regulations, shall be considered a part of the county or city's development regulations.

2. The shoreline master program shall be adopted pursuant to the procedures of chapter 90.58 RCW rather than the goals, policies, and procedures set forth in this chapter for the adoption of a comprehensive plan or development regulations.

3. [Empty]

    a. The policies, goals, and provisions of chapter 90.58 RCW and applicable guidelines shall be the sole basis for determining compliance of a shoreline master program with this chapter except as the shoreline master program is required to comply with the internal consistency provisions of RCW 36.70A.070, 36.70A.040(4), 35.63.125, and 35A.63.105.

    b. Except as otherwise provided in (c) of this subsection, development regulations adopted under this chapter to protect critical areas within shorelines of the state apply within shorelines of the state until the department of ecology approves one of the following: A comprehensive master program update, as defined in RCW 90.58.030; a segment of a master program relating to critical areas, as provided in RCW 90.58.090; or a new or amended master program approved by the department of ecology on or after March 1, 2002, as provided in RCW 90.58.080. The adoption or update of development regulations to protect critical areas under this chapter prior to department of ecology approval of a master program update as provided in this subsection is not a comprehensive or segment update to the master program.

    c. [Empty]

        i. Until the department of ecology approves a master program or segment of a master program as provided in (b) of this subsection, a use or structure legally located within shorelines of the state that was established or vested on or before the effective date of the local government's development regulations to protect critical areas may continue as a conforming use and may be redeveloped or modified if: (A) The redevelopment or modification is consistent with the local government's master program; and (B) the local government determines that the proposed redevelopment or modification will result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. The local government may waive this requirement if the redevelopment or modification is consistent with the master program and the local government's development regulations to protect critical areas.

        ii. For purposes of this subsection (3)(c), an agricultural activity that does not expand the area being used for the agricultural activity is not a redevelopment or modification. "Agricultural activity," as used in this subsection (3)(c), has the same meaning as defined in RCW 90.58.065.

    d. Upon department of ecology approval of a shoreline master program or critical area segment of a shoreline master program, critical areas within shorelines of the state are protected under chapter 90.58 RCW and are not subject to the procedural and substantive requirements of this chapter, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section. Nothing in chapter 321, Laws of 2003 or chapter 107, Laws of 2010 is intended to affect whether or to what extent agricultural activities, as defined in RCW 90.58.065, are subject to chapter 36.70A RCW.

    e. The provisions of RCW 36.70A.172 shall not apply to the adoption or subsequent amendment of a local government's shoreline master program and shall not be used to determine compliance of a local government's shoreline master program with chapter 90.58 RCW and applicable guidelines. Nothing in this section, however, is intended to limit or change the quality of information to be applied in protecting critical areas within shorelines of the state, as required by chapter 90.58 RCW and applicable guidelines.

4. Shoreline master programs shall provide a level of protection to critical areas located within shorelines of the state that assures no net loss of shoreline ecological functions necessary to sustain shoreline natural resources as defined by department of ecology guidelines adopted pursuant to RCW 90.58.060.

5. Shorelines of the state shall not be considered critical areas under this chapter except to the extent that specific areas located within shorelines of the state qualify for critical area designation based on the definition of critical areas provided by RCW 36.70A.030(6) and have been designated as such by a local government pursuant to RCW 36.70A.060(2).

6. If a local jurisdiction's master program does not include land necessary for buffers for critical areas that occur within shorelines of the state, as authorized by RCW 90.58.030(2)(d), then the local jurisdiction shall continue to regulate those critical areas and their required buffers pursuant to RCW 36.70A.060(2).


## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [36.70A](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

1. The requirements of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction subelement of the climate change and resiliency element set forth in RCW 36.70A.070 apply only to those counties, and the cities within those counties, that meet either of the following criteria on or after January 1, 2021:

    a. A county with a population density of at least 100 people per square mile and a population of at least 200,000; or

    b. A county with a population density of at least 75 people per square mile and an annual growth rate of at least 1.75 percent as determined by the office of financial management.

2. Once a county meets either of the sets of criteria set forth in subsection (1) of this section, the requirement to conform with the greenhouse gas emissions reduction subelement of the climate change and resiliency element set forth in RCW 36.70A.070 remains in effect, even if the county no longer meets one of these sets of criteria.

3. If the population of a county that previously had not been required to conform with the greenhouse gas emissions reduction subelement of the climate change and resiliency element set forth in RCW 36.70A.070 changes sufficiently to meet either of the sets of criteria set forth in subsection (1) of this section, the county, and the cities within that county, shall adopt a greenhouse gas emissions reduction subelement of the climate change and resiliency element set forth in RCW 36.70A.070 at the next scheduled update of the comprehensive plan as set forth in RCW 36.70A.130.
