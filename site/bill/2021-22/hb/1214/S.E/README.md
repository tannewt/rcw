# Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1214 as Recommended by Education

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1214-S.E.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact that interactions with police have on youth of color and on Black youth in particular. Not only are Black youth more likely than their white peers to have contact with police at a young age despite similar or lower rates of illegal behavior, but early police contact for Black youth is predictive of future arrests in a way that is not true for white youth.

2. The legislature finds that schools should be a place in which all youth feel safe and it is imperative that school resource officers, school security officers, and other school safety and security staff do not contribute to an unsafe environment for Black youth and youth of color.

3. The legislature recognizes that chapter 333, Laws of 2019 made significant improvements to the quality and transparency of school districts' school resource officer programs by implementing training and intergovernmental agreement requirements. However, the legislature intends to expand these requirements to other school safety and security staff. The legislature also expects to require on-the-job training. In addition, the legislature finds that in order to understand the full scope and impact of safety and security staff on school property, additional information must be collected and made publicly available.
