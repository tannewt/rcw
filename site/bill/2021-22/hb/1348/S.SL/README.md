## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Having access to same day and next day physical and behavioral health services is imperative to facilitate successful reentry for individuals releasing from jails;

    b. The overwhelming majority of individuals in jails are incarcerated for less than 30 days;

    c. Suspending medicaid for individuals on short-term jail stays causes significant delays in medicaid reinstatement upon release; and

    d. Delays in medicaid reinstatement impede access to physical and behavioral health appointments and prescription medications upon release.

2. The legislature intends to facilitate successful jail reentry by not suspending medicaid for individuals who are incarcerated for less than 30 days.
