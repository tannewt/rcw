## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [43.21C.229](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.021C_state_environmental_policy.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.021C_state_environmental_policy.md) for context.

1. In order to accommodate infill development and thereby realize the goals and policies of comprehensive plans adopted according to chapter 36.70A RCW, a city or county planning under RCW 36.70A.040 is authorized by this section to establish categorical exemptions from the requirements of this chapter. An exemption adopted under this section applies even if it differs from the categorical exemptions adopted by rule of the department under RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a). An exemption **must** be adopted by a city or county under this section **and meet** the following criteria:

    a. It categorically exempts government action related to development proposed to fill in an urban growth area, designated according to RCW 36.70A.110, where current density and intensity of use in the area is roughly equal to or lower than called for in the goals and policies of the applicable comprehensive plan and the development is either:

        i. Residential development;

        ii. Mixed-use development; or

        iii. Commercial development up to sixty-five thousand square feet, excluding retail development;

    b. It does not exempt government action related to development that is inconsistent with the applicable comprehensive plan or would clearly exceed the density or intensity of use called for in the goals and policies of the applicable comprehensive plan; **and**

    c.

        i. The city or county's applicable comprehensive plan was previously subjected to environmental analysis through an environmental impact statement under the requirements of this chapter prior to adoption; or

        ii. The city or county has prepared an environmental impact statement that considers the proposed use or density and intensity of use in the area proposed for an exemption under this section.

2. **Notwithstanding the requirements in subsection (1) of this section, if the legislative body of a local government considers the specific probable adverse environmental impacts of the proposed government action relating to development and adopts a finding that these specific impacts are not adequately addressed by the development regulations or other applicable requirements of the comprehensive plan, subarea plan element of the comprehensive plan, planned action ordinance, or other local, state, or federal rules or laws, the local government may require the development to comply with the other requirements of this chapter.**

3. Any categorical exemption adopted by a city or county under this section shall be subject to the rules of the department adopted according to RCW 43.21C.110(1)(a) that provide exceptions to the use of categorical exemptions adopted by the department.
