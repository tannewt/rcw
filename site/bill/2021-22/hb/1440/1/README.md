[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1440.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds and declares that:

1. As a result of COVID-19, Washington state schools are largely operating on a distance learning model and many citizens are working remotely. Communications networks, including both wired and wireless, have done much work to meet these growing needs, but additional work is required to facilitate widespread deployment of next-generation wireless and broadband network facilities;

2. Wireless and broadband products and services are a significant and continually growing part of the state's economy. Accordingly, encouraging the development of strong and robust wireless and broadband communications networks throughout the state is integral to the state's economic competitiveness;

3. Rapid deployment of small wireless facilities will serve numerous important statewide goals and the public policy, including: Meeting growing consumer demand for wireless data; increasing competitive options for communications services available to the state's residents; promoting the ability of the state's citizens to communicate with other citizens and with their schools, state, and local governments; and promoting public safety;

4. Small wireless facilities, including facilities commonly referred to as small cells and distributed antenna systems, are deployed most effectively in the rights-of-way;

5. To meet the key objectives of this chapter and federal law, wireless providers must have access to the rights-of-way and the ability to attach to infrastructure in the rights-of-way to densify their networks and provide next-generation wireless services;

6. Rates and fees for the permitting and deployment of small wireless facilities in rights-of-way and on authority infrastructure, including poles, throughout the state, consistent with federal law, is reasonable and will encourage the development of robust next-generation wireless and broadband networks for the benefit of citizens throughout the state; and

7. The procedures, rates, and fees in this chapter are consistent with federal law and are fair and reasonable when viewed from the perspective of the state's citizens and the state's interest in having robust, reliable, and technologically advanced wireless and broadband networks and reflect a balancing of the interests of the wireless providers deploying new facilities and the interests of authorities in recovering their costs of managing access to the rights-of-way and the attachment space provided on authority infrastructure in the rights-of-way.

## Section 3
1. This section applies to activities of a wireless provider within the rights-of-way to deploy small wireless facilities and associated poles.

2. An authority may not enter into an exclusive arrangement with any person for use of the rights-of-way for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation, operation, marketing, modification, maintenance, or replacement of poles for such collocation.

3. Subject to this section, a wireless provider has the right, as a permitted use not subject to zoning review or approval, to collocate small wireless facilities and install, maintain, modify, operate, and replace poles along, across, upon, and under the rights-of-way. Such structures and facilities must be installed and maintained so as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on the rights-of-way or obstruct the legal use of the rights-of-way by utilities.

4. Each new or modified pole installed in the rights-of-way for the purpose of collocation of small wireless facilities may not exceed the greater of: (a) 50 feet in height above ground level; or (b) ten percent taller than the tallest existing structure in place in the rights-of-way, as of the effective date of this section, located within 500 feet of the new structure in the same rights-of-way. A wireless provider has the right to collocate a small wireless facility and install, maintain, modify, operate, and replace a pole that exceeds these height limits along, across, upon, and under the rights-of-way, subject to this section and applicable zoning regulations.

5. An authority may adopt standards in its code governing the deployment of small wireless facilities and associated poles in the rights-of-way, subject to the following conditions:

    a. The aesthetic requirements must be: (i) Reasonable, in that they are technically feasible and reasonably directed to avoiding or remedying the intangible public harm of unsightly or out-of-character deployments; (ii) no more burdensome than those applied to other types of infrastructure deployments; and (iii) objective and published in advance.

    b. An authority may deny a permit for not complying with aesthetic requirements only if the authority has found that a denial does not create an effective prohibition of wireless services.

    c. Aesthetic requirements applicable to deployment on decorative poles and in historic districts must also comply with the following requirements:

        i. A wireless provider must be permitted to collocate on or replace decorative poles when necessary to deploy a small wireless facility. An authority may require the collocation or decorative pole replacement to reasonably conform to the design aesthetics of the original decorative pole or poles, provided that these requirements are technically feasible.

        ii. A wireless provider shall be permitted to collocate small wireless facilities or replace poles in historic districts. Consistent with this subsection, an authority may require design or concealment measures for small wireless facilities and associated poles in historic districts. Any such design or concealment measures may not be considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size parameters in the definition of small wireless facility. New poles must be permitted if collocation is not an option.

        iii. A wireless provider must be permitted to place a new pole, subject to the terms of this subsection, where to deny placement of the new pole would be an effective prohibition of service.

6. A wireless provider must comply with undergrounding requirements where:

    a. The authority has required all electric and communications lines to be placed underground by three months prior to the submission of the application;

    b. Structures the authority allows to remain must be made available to wireless providers for the collocation of small wireless facilities, and may be replaced by a wireless provider to accommodate the collocation of small wireless facilities, in compliance with this chapter;

    c. A wireless provider may install a new pole in the designated area that otherwise complies with this section when it is not able to provide wireless services by collocating on a remaining pole or other structure; and

    d. For small wireless facilities installed before an authority adopts requirements that communications and electric lines be placed underground, an authority adopting such requirements must permit: (i) A wireless provider to maintain the small wireless facilities in place on any structure not required to be removed, subject to any applicable pole attachment agreement with the pole owner; or (ii) the wireless provider to replace an existing pole within 50 feet of the prior location.

7. The authority may require a wireless provider to repair all damage to the rights-of-way directly caused by the activities of the wireless provider in the rights-of-way and to return the rights-of-way to its functional equivalence before the damage pursuant to the competitively neutral, reasonable requirements and specifications of the authority. If the wireless provider fails to make the repairs required by the authority within a reasonable time after written notice, the authority may make those repairs and charge the applicable party the reasonable, documented cost of such repairs.

8. A wireless provider may not be required to replace or upgrade an existing pole or the electrical components supporting the pole except for reasons of structural necessity or compliance with applicable codes. A wireless provider may, with the permission of the pole owner, replace or modify existing poles, but any such replacement or modification must be consistent with the design aesthetics of the pole being modified or replaced.

9. A wireless provider is required to notify the authority at least 30 days before its abandonment of a small wireless facility. Following receipt of such a notice, the authority shall direct the wireless provider to remove all or any portion of the small wireless facility that the authority determines would be in the best interest of the public safety and public welfare to remove. If the wireless provider fails to remove the abandoned facility within 90 days after such a notice, the authority may undertake to do so and recover the actual and reasonable expenses of doing so from the wireless provider or its successors or assigns.


## Section 4

2. Except as provided in this chapter, an authority may not prohibit, regulate, or charge for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation, modification, or replacement of associated poles that may be permitted in this section.

3. An authority may require an applicant to obtain one or more permits to collocate a small wireless facility or install a new, modified, or replacement pole associated with a small wireless facility as provided in section 3 of this act, provided that such permits are of general applicability and do not apply exclusively to wireless facilities. An authority must receive and process applications subject to the following requirements:

    a. An authority may not directly or indirectly require an applicant to perform services or provide goods unrelated to the permit, such as in-kind contributions to the authority including, but not limited to, reserving fiber, conduit, or pole space for the authority.

    b. An applicant may not be required to provide more information to obtain a permit than communications service providers that are not wireless providers are required to provide, provided that an applicant may be required to include construction and engineering drawings and information demonstrating compliance with the criteria in (h) of this subsection.

    c. An authority may not require the: (i) Collocation of small wireless facilities on any specific pole or category of poles; (ii) use of specific pole types or configurations when installing new or replacement poles; or (iii) underground placements of small wireless facilities that are designated in an application to be pole-mounted or ground-mounted.

    d. An authority may not limit the collocation of small wireless facilities by minimum horizontal separation distance requirements from existing small wireless facilities, poles, or other structures.

    e. The authority may require an applicant to include an attestation that the small wireless facilities will be operational for use by a wireless services provider within one year after the permit issuance date, unless the authority and the applicant agree to extend this period or delay is caused by lack of commercial power, communications transport facilities to the site, or any other factors outside of the applicant's control.

    f. Within 10 days of receiving an application, an authority must determine and notify the applicant in writing whether the application is complete. If an application is incomplete, an authority must specifically identify the missing information in writing. The processing deadline in (g) of this subsection must restart at zero on the date the applicant provides the missing information to complete the application.

    g. An application must be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis. The authority shall approve or deny an application within (i) 60 days of receipt of an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility using an existing structure; and (ii) 90 days for an application to collocate a small wireless facility on a new structure.

Such spacing requirements may not prevent a wireless provider from serving any location;

    v. Designates the location of a new pole for the purpose of collocating a small wireless facility within seven feet in any direction of an electrical conductor, unless the wireless provider obtains the written consent of the power supplier that owns or manages the electrical conductor;

    vi. Fails to comply with applicable codes; or

    vii. Fails to comply with section 3 (4), (5), or (6) of this act.

    j. The authority must document the basis for a denial, including the specific code, rule, or statutory provisions on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the authority denies an application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the authority and resubmit the application within 30 days of the denial without paying an additional application fee. The authority shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days of resubmission and limit its review to the deficiencies cited in the denial.

    k. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of a single authority may file a consolidated application for small wireless facilities and associated poles and receive a single permit for the collocation of multiple small wireless facilities and the placement of associated poles. However, the denial of one or more small wireless facilities in a consolidated application may not delay processing of any other small wireless facilities or poles in the same consolidated application. Batch applications must be collectively processed in accordance with the procedures in this section. A batch application that includes new pole deployments is subject to a 90-day time frame for approval.

    l. Installation or collocation for which a permit is granted pursuant to this section must be completed within one year after the permit issuance date unless the authority and the applicant agree to extend this period, or a delay is caused by the lack of commercial power or communications facilities at the site. Approval of an application authorizes the applicant to:

        i. Undertake the installation or collocation; and

        ii. Subject to applicable relocation requirements and the applicant's right to terminate at any time, operate and maintain the small wireless facilities and any associated pole covered by the permit for a period of not less than 10 years, which must be renewed for equivalent durations so long as the facilities comply with the criteria set forth in (h) of this subsection.

    m. An authority may not institute, either expressly or de facto, a moratorium on (i) filing, receiving, or processing applications; or (ii) issuing permits or other required approvals, if any, for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation, modification, or replacement of associated poles.

4. An authority may not require an application for: (a) Routine maintenance; (b) the replacement of small wireless facilities with small wireless facilities that are substantially similar or the same size or smaller; or (c) the installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles, in compliance with the applicable codes. However, an authority may require a permit for work that requires excavation or closure of sidewalks or vehicular lanes within the rights-of-way for such activities. Such a permit must be issued to the applicant on a nondiscriminatory basis upon terms and conditions applied to any other person's activities in the rights-of-way that require excavation, closing of sidewalks, or vehicular lanes.


## Section 5
1. This section applies to activities of a wireless provider accessing authority poles to collocate small wireless facilities.

2. A person owning, managing, or controlling authority structures in the rights-of-way may not enter into an exclusive arrangement with any person for the right to attach to such structures. A person who purchases or otherwise acquires an authority structure is subject to the requirements of this section.

3. An authority shall allow the collocation of small wireless facilities on authority structures on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions using the standards in section 3(5) of this act and the process in section 4 of this act.

4. The rate to collocate on authority structures is provided in section 6 of this act.

4. A wireless provider shall pay an authority compensation for use of the rights-of-way and collocation on authority structures in the rights-of-way an annual rate not to exceed $270 per small wireless facility. This rate, together with the one-time application fee, is the total compensation that the wireless provider is required to pay the authority for the deployment of each small wireless facility in the rights-of-way and any associated pole. In addition, an authority may not charge a rate for the wireline backhaul facilities, coaxial, or fiber optic cable associated with a small wireless facility.


## Section 7
This section applies to activities in the rights-of-way only. Nothing in this chapter may be interpreted to allow any entity to provide services regulated under 47 U.S.C. Sec. 521 through 573, without compliance with all laws applicable to such providers. Nor may this chapter be interpreted to impose any new requirements on cable providers for the provision of such service.


## Section 8
Subject to this chapter and applicable law, an authority may continue to exercise zoning, land use, planning, and permitting authority within its territorial boundaries with respect to wireless support structures and other structures, including the enforcement of applicable codes. An authority may not have or exercise any jurisdiction or authority over the design, engineering, construction, installation, or operation of a small wireless facility located in an interior structure or upon the site of a campus, stadium, or athletic facility not owned or controlled by the authority, other than to require compliance with applicable codes. Nothing in this chapter authorizes the state or any political subdivision, including an authority, to require wireless facility deployment or to regulate wireless services.


## Section 9
This chapter does not apply to poles owned by an investor-owned utility, except as it concerns a wireless provider's access to the rights-of-way and permits for the collocation of small wireless facilities on such utility poles pursuant to a pole attachment agreement between the wireless provider and the investor-owned utility.


## Section 10
1. An authority may adopt an ordinance that makes available to wireless providers rates, fees, and other terms that comply with this chapter. Subject to the other provisions of this section, in the absence of an ordinance or agreement that fully complies with this chapter and until such a compliant ordinance is adopted, if at all, a wireless provider may install and operate small wireless facilities and associated poles under the requirements of this chapter. An authority may not require a wireless provider to enter into an agreement to implement this chapter, but such an agreement is permissible if voluntary and nondiscriminatory.

2. Ordinances and agreements implementing this chapter are public/private arrangements and are matters of legitimate and significant statewide concern.

3. An agreement or ordinance that does not fully comply with this chapter applies only to small wireless facilities and associated poles that were operational before the effective date of this section and are deemed invalid and unenforceable beginning on the 181st day after the effective date of this section unless amended to fully comply with this chapter. If an agreement or ordinance is invalid in accordance with this subsection, small wireless facilities and associated poles that became operational before the effective date of this section, pursuant to such an agreement or ordinance, may remain installed and be operated under the requirements of this chapter.

4. An agreement or ordinance that applies to small wireless facilities and associated poles that become operational on or after the effective date of this section is invalid and unenforceable unless it fully complies with this chapter. In the absence of an ordinance or agreement that fully complies with this chapter, a wireless provider may install and operate small wireless facilities and associated poles in the rights-of-way under the requirements of this chapter.


## Section 11
The utilities and transportation commission, binding arbitration, or any court or agency of competent jurisdiction, has jurisdiction to determine disputes arising under this chapter. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on authority structures, the person owning or controlling the pole must allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than $270 for both collocation on authority structures and use of the rights-of-way with rates to be trued up upon final resolution of the dispute. Any disputes, wherever filed, must be pursued in accordance with accelerated docket or complaint procedures, where available.


## Section 12
1. An authority may adopt reasonable indemnification, insurance, and bonding requirements related to small wireless facility and associated pole permits subject to the requirements of this section and section 3(5) of this act.

2. An authority may not require a wireless provider to indemnify and hold the authority and its officers and employees harmless against any claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, or fees, except when a court of competent jurisdiction has found that the negligence of the wireless provider while installing, repairing, or maintaining caused the harm that created such claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, or fees.

3. An authority may require a wireless provider to have in effect insurance coverage consistent with subsection (2) of this section, as long as the authority imposes similar requirements on other rights-of-way users and these requirements are reasonable and nondiscriminatory.

    a. An authority may not require a wireless provider to obtain insurance naming the authority or its officers and employees an additional insured.

    b. An authority may require a wireless provider to furnish proof of insurance, if required, prior to the effective date of any permit issued for a small wireless facility.

    c. An authority may adopt bonding requirements for small wireless facilities if the authority imposes similar requirements in connection with permits issued for other rights-of-way users.

    d. The purpose of such bonds must be to:

        i. Provide for the removal of abandoned or improperly maintained small wireless facilities, including those that an authority determines need to be removed to protect public health, safety, or welfare;

        ii. Restore the rights-of-way in connection with removals as provided for in this chapter; or

        iii. Recoup rates or fees that have not been paid by a wireless provider in over 12 months, as long as the wireless provider has received reasonable notice from the authority of any of the noncompliance listed in this subsection and an opportunity to cure.

4. Bonding requirements may not exceed $200 per small wireless facility. For wireless providers with multiple small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of a single authority, the total bond amount across all facilities may not exceed $10,000, which amount may be combined into one bond instrument.


## Section 13
This act may be known and cited as the small wireless facilities deployment act.
