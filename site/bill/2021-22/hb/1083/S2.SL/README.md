## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [59.21.005](/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.md) for context.

The legislature recognizes that it is quite costly for tenants who own homes in manufactured/mobile home parks to relocate when the park in which they reside is closed or converted to another use. Many such tenants need financial assistance in order to relocate from a manufactured/mobile home park. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a mechanism for assisting manufactured/mobile home tenants to relocate their manufactured/mobile homes to suitable alternative sites or demolish and dispose of their homes and secure **alternative** housing **of their choice**.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [59.21.021](/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.21_mobile_home_relocation_assistance.md) for context.

1. If a manufactured/mobile home park is**, or is scheduled to be** closed or converted to another use, eligible tenants shall be entitled to relocation assistance on a first-come, first-serve basis. The department shall give priority for distribution of relocation assistance to eligible tenants residing in parks that are closed as a result of park-owner fraud or as a result of health and safety concerns as determined by the local board of health. Payments shall be made upon the department's verification of eligibility, subject to the availability of remaining funds.

2. Eligibility for relocation assistance funds is limited to low-income households **in manufactured/mobile home parks that are, or are scheduled to be, closed or converted to another use**.

3. Eligible tenants  are entitled to financial assistance from the fund, up to a maximum of **$17,000** for a multisection home and up to a maximum of **$11,000** for a single-section home. The department shall distribute relocation assistance for each eligible tenant as follows:

    a. **$12,000 for a multisection home and $8,000 for a single-section home shall be disbursed** in the form of cash assistance to help the tenant **relocate the home or** secure **alternative** housing; and

    b. **The remainder of the total assistance shall be disbursed once the tenant has transferred the title to the park-owner, relocated the home, or demolished and disposed of the home. The tenant must either transfer title of the manufactured/mobile home to the park-owner, relocate, or demolish and dispose of the home within 90 days of receiving the assistance under (a) of this subsection to receive the remainder of the assistance**.

4. **In the event that the tenant does not relocate or demolish and dispose of the home within 90 days of receiving assistance from the fund, the park-owner may seek reimbursement from the fund in the amount of $4,000 for a multisection home and $2,500 for a single-section home.**

    a. **To receive such reimbursement, the park-owner must provide documentation to the department demonstrating costs incurred for demolition and disposal of the home.**

    b. **The park-owner may seek reimbursement for additional costs incurred for demolition and disposal of the home up to an additional $4,500 for a multisection home and $3,000 for a single-section home from the portion of the relocation fund to which park-owners must contribute pursuant to RCW 59.30.050.**

5. Any individual or organization may apply to receive **relocation assistance** from the fund, for use in combination with funds from public or private sources, toward relocation of tenants eligible under this section, with agreement from the tenant.

6. The legislature intends the cash assistance provided under subsection (3) of this section to be considered a one-time direct grant payment that shall be excluded from household income calculations for purposes of determining the eligibility of the recipient for benefits or assistance under any state program financed in whole or in part with state funds.
