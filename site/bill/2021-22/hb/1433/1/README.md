# House Bill 1433

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1433.pdf)
## Section 1
This act may be known and cited as the people's privacy act.


## Section 2
The legislature finds that:

1. Washingtonians have an explicit right to privacy under Article I, section 7 of the Washington state Constitution and this act furthers protection of that fundamental constitutional right.

2. Advances in technology and the rapid growth in the volume and variety of personal information being generated, collected, stored, and analyzed have increased harms to individual and collective privacy, making the protection of this vital right a matter of urgency.

3. Privacy violations and misuse of personal information in the digital age can lead to a range of harms, including discrimination in employment, health care, housing, access to credit, and other areas; unfair price discrimination; domestic violence; abuse; stalking; harassment; entrapment; and financial, emotional, and reputational harms.

4. Privacy harms disproportionately affect low-income people and people of color.

5. Privacy violations not only threaten the fundamental rights and privileges of Washingtonians, but they also menace the foundation and supporting institutions of a free democratic state.

6. Washingtonians are increasingly required to share personal information and are subjected to automated forms of surveillance and classification as a consequence of simply participating in public life and accessing basic social goods, services, and opportunities.

7. Entities that collect, use, retain, share, and monetize personal information have specialized knowledge about the algorithms and data security measures they use, as well as information about how they collect, use, retain, share, and monetize personal information that the average individual is unlikely to understand. Just as banks, lawyers, and medical providers, given their specialized knowledge, have special obligations to individuals, entities collecting intimate personal information in the digital age and benefiting from similarly specialized knowledge should have similar obligations.

8. Privacy is the foundation of consumer trust, particularly in electronic commerce, and people will use advanced data-driven technology only if their privacy rights are respected, their personal information is safeguarded, and their freedom to choose how much personal information to share is unobstructed.

9. The state of Washington is more protective of personal privacy than many other states and has an obligation to ensure that its residents can control their personal information and are able to understand and regulate how that personal information may be used by others.

10. Requiring entities to obtain opt-in consent prior to the use or disclosure of personal information is essential to protecting personal privacy. Without opt-in consent, individuals who wish to control their personal information face an insurmountable challenge of identifying and engaging with each and every entity they encounter, while businesses lack the incentive to present individuals with meaningful opportunities to choose. An opt-in approach gives people meaningful control over their personal information while allowing businesses to choose how and whether they request consent to process that information.


## Section 3
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Biometric information" means a record of one or more measurable biological or behavioral characteristics that can be used alone or in combination with each other or with other information for automated recognition of a known or unknown individual.

If the policy is delivered verbally, the person communicating the policy must offer to read the list of third parties. If provided in the short-form privacy notice, such list must be offset by at least two line breaks from the rest of the short-form privacy notice required under (a) of this subsection.

    e. Within six months of enactment, the Washington state department of commerce shall establish a standardized short-form privacy notice that complies with this subsection (1).

    f. Within six months of enactment, the Washington state department of commerce shall determine whether a more concise presentation of a short-form privacy notice is appropriate where the policy is being communicated verbally, and if so, shall establish a standardized short-form verbal privacy notice that complies with this subsection (1).

    g. To promote individuals' access to and awareness of the privacy notices, within six months of enactment, the Washington state department of commerce shall develop a recognizable and uniform logo or button to be used on covered entities' interaction pages linking to the entities' short-form privacy notice.

        i. Process the individual's captured personal information; or

        ii. Make any changes in the processing of the individual's captured personal information that would necessitate a change to the information required to be provided under subsection (1)(c) of this section.

    b. For continuing interactions, whether by automatic renewal or nontime-limited interactions, the opt-in consent required by this subsection must be renewed not less than annually, and if not so renewed shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.

    c. A covered entity requesting consent shall ensure that the option to withhold consent is presented as clearly and prominently as the option to provide consent.

    d. A covered entity shall provide a mechanism for an individual to withdraw previously given consent at any time. The individual shall be notified when the withdrawal of consent is complete. It must be as easy for an individual to withdraw their consent as it is for the individual to provide consent.

    e. Under no circumstances shall an individual's interaction with a covered entity's product or service when the covered entity has a terms of service or a privacy policy, including the short-form privacy notice, in and of itself constitute freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent.

    f. To the extent that a covered entity must process internet protocol addresses, system configuration information, uniform resource locators of referring pages, locale and language preferences, keystrokes, and other captured personal information in order to obtain individuals' freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent, the covered entity shall:

        i. Process only the captured personal information necessary to request freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent;

A covered entity shall not discriminate against individuals by reason of their not granting opt-in consent to the processing of their personal information under this chapter or otherwise exercising their rights under this chapter, including but not limited to, by: Denying goods or services to the individual; charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the individual; and suggesting that the individual will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. Notwithstanding the above, a covered entity may, with the individual's opt-in consent given in compliance with this subsection (2), operate a program in which information, products or services sold to the individual are discounted based on that individual's prior purchases from the covered entity, provided that the captured personal information shall be processed solely for the purpose of operating such program.

    i. A covered entity shall not state or imply that the quality of a product or service will be diminished and shall not actually diminish the quality of a product or service if the individual declines to give opt-in consent to captured personal information processing.

    j. The Washington state department of commerce is hereby authorized and directed to conduct a study to determine the most effective way for covered entities to obtain individuals' freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent for each type of captured personal information processing.

    k. The Washington state department of commerce may request data and information from covered entities conducting business in Washington state, other Washington state government entities administering notice and consent regimes, consumer protection experts, privacy advocates, and researchers, internet standards setting bodies such as the internet engineering taskforce and institute of electrical and electronics engineers, and other relevant sources to meet the purpose of the study.

    l. Within six months of enactment, the Washington state department of commerce shall adopt regulations specifying how:

        i. Covered entities must notify individuals of their rights under this chapter and obtain individuals' freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent for each use model of captured personal information processing; and

        ii. Covered entities must notify individuals of their right to withdraw their consent at any time and how the right may be exercised.

    m. Within six months of enactment, the Washington state department of commerce shall adopt regulations grouping different types of processing of captured personal information by use model and permitting a covered entity to simultaneously obtain freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent from an individual for multiple transactions of the same use model.

3. Obligation of care.

    a. In storing, using, and transmitting captured personal information, a covered entity shall use practices that at least satisfy the reasonable standard of care within the covered entity's industry for protecting captured personal information from disclosure.

    b. The Washington state department of commerce, in consultation with the office of privacy and data protection, may develop appropriate security standards for captured personal information. This subsection preempts (a) of this subsection only to the extent that security standards developed are more protective of captured personal information than is the industry standard of care.

4. Access to personal information.

    a. A covered entity that processes an individual's captured personal information must provide the individual with a reasonable means to access their personal information processed by such entity, including:

        i. Where the covered entity has reasonable doubts or cannot verify the identity of the individual making a request under (b) through (d) of this subsection, the covered entity may request additional personal information necessary for the specific purpose of confirming the identity of the individual.

        ii. A covered entity may not deidentify an individual's captured personal information during the 60-day period beginning on the date the covered entity receives a request from the individual under (b) through (d) of this subsection.

## Section 7
In addition to all provisions of this chapter applicable to captured personal information, the following provisions shall be applicable to all biometric information, regardless of how such biometric information is processed.

1. Retention; disclosure; destruction. A covered entity or Washington governmental entity that processes biometric information must develop a written policy, made available to the public, establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric information when the initial purpose for processing such information has been satisfied or within one year of the individual's last interaction with the covered entity or Washington governmental entity, whichever occurs first. Consent under subsection (2) of this section shall be for a period specified in the written consent of not more than one year, and shall automatically expire at the end of such period unless renewed pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. Upon expiration of consent, any biometric information possessed by a covered entity or Washington governmental entity must be destroyed. Absent a valid warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, a covered entity or Washington governmental entity in possession of biometric information must comply with its established retention schedule and destruction guidelines.

2. Processing. No covered entity or Washington governmental entity may process an individual's biometric information, unless it first:

    a. Informs the individual in writing that biometric information is being processed;

    b. Informs the individual in writing the details of the specific purpose or purposes and length of term for which biometric information processed;

    c. Receives a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous written opt-in consent executed by the individual specifically authorizing such processing; and

    d. Consents to processing information pursuant to the protocols for human experimentation constitutes freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent under this section.

3. Disclosure. No covered entity or Washington governmental entity in possession of biometric information may disclose or otherwise disseminate an individual's biometric information unless:

    a. The individual gives freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent in writing to the disclosure or redisclosure;

    b. The disclosure or redisclosure is used solely to complete a financial transaction requested or authorized by the subject of the biometric information;

    c. The disclosure or redisclosure is required by state or federal law; or

    d. The disclosure is required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a subpoena issued by a governmental entity or in a pending judicial case, provided that in the case of a subpoena the entity subject to the subpoena shall postpone compliance therewith until it has given the subject of the subpoena notice of the facts set forth in section 9(2)(b)(i) of this act has allowed at least 10 business days for the subject to seek review of or otherwise challenge the subpoena.

4. Monetizing. No covered entity or Washington governmental entity in possession of biometric information may monetize, or otherwise profit from an individual's biometric information; provided only that a covered entity may process an individual's biometric information, with full disclosure and opt-in consent consistent with section 5(2) of this act, in a service in which the covered entity reports to the individual the biometric information processed and/or utilizes the biometric information to design or recommend actions or products that have been specifically requested by the individual with full disclosure that such recommendation is based on the biometric information processed, provided that the biometric information shall not be used for any other purpose.

5. Identification. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a covered entity or governmental entity may list personal information such as name or birthdate and biometric information such as height, weight, or photograph on an issued license, membership or identification card for the sole purpose of allowing an employee or other representative of the covered entity to determine based solely on personal observation, and without the assistance of technologies such as facial recognition, whether the person physically holding such license or card is the person entitled to hold it, provided further that such intended use is disclosed to the individual prior to capturing the biometric information. Any other processing of such biometric information shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of this chapter. Any covered entity or governmental entity using personal information or biometric information under this subsection must ensure that it is not stored or processed in any manner that would allow a third party to process such information for any purpose.


## Section 8
1. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:

    a. For a covered entity or Washington governmental entity to process captured personal information for the purpose of advertising, marketing, soliciting, offering, selling, leasing, licensing, renting, or otherwise commercially contracting for employment, finance, health care, credit, insurance, housing, or education opportunities, in a manner that discriminates against or otherwise makes the opportunity unavailable on the basis of an individual's or class of individuals' actual, perceived, or proxies for actual or perceived age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, sex, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, or domestic violence victim status, except as specifically authorized by law;

    b. For a covered entity or Washington governmental entity to process captured personal information in a manner that discriminates in or otherwise makes unavailable, whether in a commercial transaction or otherwise, any place of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, or amusement as defined in RCW 49.60.040, on the basis of an individual's or class of individuals' actual, perceived, or proxies for actual or perceived age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, sex, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, or domestic violence victim status, except as specifically authorized by law;

    c. For a covered entity or Washington governmental entity that uses captured personal information in sales or placement of targeted advertisements in which persons or entities offer commercial transactions in employment, finance, health care, credit, insurance, housing, or education opportunities, to target such advertisements on actual, perceived, or proxies for actual or perceived age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, sex, disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, or domestic violence victim status, except as specifically authorized by law.

    d. For a covered entity or Washington governmental entity to operate, install, or commission the operation or installation of equipment incorporating face recognition in any place of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, or amusement, as defined in RCW 49.60.040. For the purpose of this subsection, "face recognition" means: (i) An automated or semiautomated process by which an individual is identified or attempted to be identified based on the characteristics of the individual's face; or (ii) an automated or semiautomated process by which the characteristics of an individual's face are analyzed to determine the individual's sentiment, state of mind, or other propensities including, but not limited to, the person's level of dangerousness;

    e. For a covered entity or Washington governmental entity to operate, install, or commission the operation or installation of equipment incorporating artificial intelligence-enabled profiling in any place of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, or amusement, as defined in RCW 49.60.040, or to use artificial intelligence-enabled profiling to make decisions that produce legal effects or similarly significant effects concerning individuals. Decisions that include legal effects or similarly significant effects concerning consumers include, without limitation, denial or degradation of consequential services or support, such as financial or lending services, housing, insurance, educational enrollment, criminal justice, employment opportunities, health care services, and access to basic necessities, such as food and water. For the purposes of this subsection, "artificial intelligence-enabled profiling" means the automated or semiautomated process by which the external or internal characteristics of an individual are analyzed to determine, infer, or characterize an individual's state of mind, character, propensities, protected class status, political affiliation, religious beliefs or religious affiliation, immigration status, or employability.

2. A covered entity or Washington governmental entity that sells or places targeted advertisements for employment, finance, health care, credit, insurance, housing, or education opportunities shall require persons or entities on whose behalf such sales or placement is made to certify that they are in compliance with RCW 49.60.030.

3. Nothing in this section shall limit covered entities or Washington governmental entities from processing captured personal information for legitimate testing for the purpose of preventing unlawful discrimination or otherwise determining the extent or effectiveness of the covered entity's or Washington governmental entity's compliance with this section.


## Section 9
1. With respect to captured personal information that is not biometric information, a covered entity shall not be required to obtain freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent from an individual under section 5(2) of this act if the processing is necessary to execute the specific transaction for which the individual is providing captured personal information, such as the provision of financial information to complete a purchase or the provision of a mailing address to deliver a package. However, captured personal information shall not be processed for any other purpose beyond that clear primary purpose without the freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent from the individual to whom the captured personal information pertains, except as required by law.

2. With respect to captured personal information generally, a covered entity or Washington governmental entity shall not be required to obtain freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent from an individual under section 5(2) or 7(1) of this act if:

    a. It believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any individual requires obtaining without delay captured personal information related to the emergency and the request is narrowly tailored to address the emergency, subject to the following limitations:

        i. The request shall document the factual basis for believing that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to an individual requires obtaining without delay captured personal information relating to the emergency; and

        ii. Simultaneous with the covered entity or Washington governmental entity obtaining captured personal information under this subsection (a), the covered entity or Washington governmental entity shall use reasonable efforts to inform the individual of the captured personal information obtained; the details of the emergency; and the reasons why the covered entity or Washington governmental entity needed to use, access, or disclose the biometric information and shall continue such efforts to inform until receipt of information is confirmed; and

    b. Disclosure is required to respond to a warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a subpoena issued by a governmental entity or pursuant to a pending judicial proceeding:

        i. Unless a delayed notice is ordered, both the entity requesting the warrant or subpoena and any entity receiving such warrant or subpoena shall, simultaneous with requesting or receiving a warrant compelling disclosure of or serving or receiving a subpoena for captured personal information, serve or deliver the following information to the subject of warrant or subpoena by registered or first-class mail, email, or other means reasonably calculated to be effective:

(A) A copy of the warrant or subpoena and notice that informs the individual of the nature of the inquiry with reasonable specificity;

(B) That captured personal information maintained for the individual was supplied to or requested by the requesting entity and the date on which the supplying or request took place;

(C) An inventory of the captured personal information requested or supplied; and

(D) The identity of the entity or individual from which the information is requested.

        ii. A covered entity or Washington governmental entity acting under (d) of this subsection may apply to the court for an order delaying notification, and the court may issue the order if the court determines that there is reason to believe that notification of the existence of the warrant will result in endangering the life or physical safety of an individual, flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, intimidation of potential witnesses, or otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial.

        iii. In the case of a subpoena, a covered entity subject to a subpoena shall postpone compliance therewith until it has given the subject of the subpoena notice of the information required under this subsection (2)(b)(i) and has allowed at least 10 business days for the subject to seek review of or otherwise challenge the subpoena;

    c. The disclosure is required by state or federal law;

    d. Processing involves only deidentified information.

3. This chapter shall not apply to captured personal information captured from a patient by a health care provider or health care facility as defined in RCW 48.41.030 or biometric information collected, used, or stored exclusively for medical education or research, public health or epidemiological purposes, health care treatment, insurance, payment, or operations under the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, or to X-ray, roentgen process, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography scan, mammography, or other image or film of the human anatomy used exclusively to diagnose, prognose, or treat an illness or other medical condition or to further validate scientific testing or screening.

4. To the extent the transaction requested by an individual is a covered entity's placement of that individual's personal information in the public domain, such as recording of a real estate deed showing name and address, the covered entity shall have the same rights as any other person or entity with regard to such information.

5. This chapter shall not apply to individuals sharing their personal contact information such as email addresses with other individuals in workplace, social, political or similar settings where the purpose of the information is to facilitate communication among such individuals, provided that any processing of such contact information beyond interpersonal communication shall be covered by this chapter. This chapter shall not apply to entities' publication of entity-based member or employee contact information where such publication is intended to allow members of the public to contact such member or employee in the ordinary course of the entity's operations.

6. Nothing in this chapter shall diminish any individual's or entity's rights or obligations under chapter 70.02 RCW.


## Section 10
1. Private right of action.

    a. Any individual alleging a violation of this chapter or a regulation adopted under this chapter may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. An individual protected by this chapter may not be required, as a condition of service or otherwise, to accept mandatory arbitration of a claim under this chapter.

    b. A violation of this chapter or a regulation adopted under this chapter with respect to the captured personal information of an individual constitute a rebuttable presumption of harm to that individual.

    c. In a civil action in which the plaintiff prevails, the court may award:

        i. Liquidated damages of $10,000 per violation or actual damages, whichever is greater;

        ii. Punitive damages; and

        iii. Any other relief, including but not limited to an injunction, that the court determines appropriate.

    d. In addition to any relief awarded pursuant to (c) of this subsection, the court shall award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to any prevailing plaintiff.

2. [Empty]

    a. The attorney general may bring an action in the name of the state, or as parens patriae on behalf of persons residing in the state, to enforce this chapter. For actions brought by the attorney general to enforce this chapter, the legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. For actions brought by the attorney general to enforce this section, a violation of this section is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for purposes of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. An action to enforce this section may not be brought under RCW 19.86.090.

    b. In an action brought by the attorney general, the court may award:

        i. Injunctive relief, including preliminary injunctions, to prevent further violations of and compel compliance with this chapter;

        ii. Civil penalties of up to $25,000 per violation or up to four percent of annual revenue of the covered entity, data processer, or third party, whichever is greater;

        iii. Other appropriate relief, including restitution, to redress harms to individuals or to mitigate all substantial risk of harm; and

        iv. Any other relief the court determines appropriate.

3. [Empty]

    a. A city attorney or county prosecutor in a city or county having a population in excess of 200,000, may bring an action to enforce this chapter on behalf of the residents of such city or county.

    b. In an action brought by a district attorney or a city attorney, the court may award:

        i. Injunctive relief, including preliminary injunctions, to prevent further violations of and compel compliance with this chapter;

        ii. Civil penalties of up to $25,000 per violation or up to four percent of annual revenue of the covered entity, data processer, or third party, whichever is greater;

        iii. Other appropriate relief, including restitution, to redress harms to individuals or to mitigate all substantial risk of harm; and

        iv. Any other relief the court determines appropriate.

4. When calculating damages and civil penalties, the court shall consider the number of affected individuals, the severity of the violation, and the precautions taken to prevent a violation.

5. Each individual whose captured personal information was unlawfully processed, each instance of processing counts as a separate violation. Each provision of this chapter that was violated counts as a separate violation.

6. It is a violation of this chapter for a covered entity, Washington governmental entity, or anyone else acting on behalf of a covered entity or Washington governmental entity to retaliate against an individual who makes a good-faith complaint that there has been a failure to comply with any part of this chapter. An individual who is injured by a violation of this subsection (6) may bring a civil action for monetary damages and injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

7. If a series of steps or transactions with regard to a set of personal information are undertaken with the intention of avoiding the intent of this chapter, a court shall disregard the intermediate steps or transactions for purposes of effectuating the purposes of this chapter.

8. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind, including a covered entity's terms of service or a privacy policy, including the short-form privacy notice required under section 5(1) of this act, that purports to waive or limit in any way an individual's rights under this chapter, including, but not limited to, any right to a remedy or means of enforcement, shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.

9. For purposes of causes of action based on violations of this chapter, the statute of limitations period shall commence only upon discovery of the violation of this chapter or of the injury caused by such a violation, whichever occurs later.

10. A covered entity that is a provider of an interactive computer service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 230, may not be treated as the publisher or speaker of any personal information provided by another information content provider, as defined in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 230. Allowing the posting of information by a user without other action by the interactive computer service is not considered processing of the personal information by the interactive computer service.

11. No private or government action brought pursuant to this chapter shall preclude any other action under this chapter.


## Section 11
1. This chapter shall not supersede local or state laws, regulations, or ordinances except to the extent that it provides stronger privacy protections for individuals.

2. Subject to subsection (3) of this section, covered entities that are subject to federal laws concerning the processing of individuals' captured personal information are covered by this chapter to the extent that it provides stronger privacy protections for individuals than those federal laws and that those federal laws do not preempt state laws.

3. This chapter shall not override any valid law or regulation explicitly compelling disclosure of or giving access to captured personal information such as in chapter 42.17A RCW.


## Section 12
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
