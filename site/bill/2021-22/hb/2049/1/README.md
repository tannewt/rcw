[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2049.pdf)
## Section 1
Washington state has the fewest housing units per household in the nation according to a presentation by the lieutenant governor. The permitting of buildings is one area that has been identified as a hindrance to increasing the number of housing units in Washington state. The legislature finds that streamlining the processing of building permits is a powerful way to combat the lack of housing in this state.


## Section 2

The development regulations must, for each type of permit application, specify the contents of a completed project permit application necessary for the complete compliance with the time periods and procedures.

## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [36.70B.120](/rcw/36_counties/36.070B_local_project_review.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070B_local_project_review.md) for context.

1. Each local government planning under RCW 36.70A.040 shall establish a permit review process that provides for the integrated and consolidated review and decision on two or more project permits relating to a proposed project action, including a single application review and approval process covering all project permits requested by an applicant for all or part of a project action and a designated permit coordinator. If an applicant elects the consolidated permit review process, the determination of completeness, notice of application, and notice of final decision must include all project permits being reviewed through the consolidated permit review process.

2. Consolidated permit review may provide different procedures for different categories of project permits, but if a project action requires project permits from more than one category, the local government shall provide for consolidated permit review with a single open record hearing and no more than one closed record appeal as provided in RCW 36.70B.060. Each local government shall determine which project permits are subject to an open record hearing and a closed record appeal. Examples of categories of project permits include but are not limited to:

    a. Proposals that are categorically exempt from chapter 43.21C RCW, such as construction permits, that do not require environmental review or public notice;

    b. Permits that require environmental review, but no open record predecision hearing; and

    c. Permits that require a threshold determination and an open record predecision hearing and may provide for a closed record appeal to a hearing body or officer or to the local government legislative body.

3. A local government may provide by ordinance or resolution for the same or a different decision maker or hearing body or officer for different categories of project permits. In the case of consolidated project permit review, the local government shall specify which decision makers shall make the decision or recommendation, conduct the hearing, or decide the appeal to ensure that consolidated permit review occurs as provided in this section. The consolidated permit review may combine an open record predecision hearing on one or more permits with an open record appeal hearing on other permits. In such cases, the local government by ordinance or resolution shall specify which project permits, if any, shall be subject to a closed record appeal.

4. **Each local government planning under RCW 36.70A.040 shall establish a permit review process which must include a technical review of the application for conformity with the requirements by all departments, divisions, and sections of the local government with jurisdiction over the project before returning the permit to the applicant for corrections and changes.**
