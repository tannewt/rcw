# House Bill 1152

## Section 1
The legislature finds the COVID-19 pandemic has been the most difficult challenge in Washington's public health history since the 1918 flu pandemic. More Americans have died from COVID-19 than the number of United States troops killed in combat during World War II. The COVID-19 pandemic response has stressed and strained every part of our society and far surpassed the capabilities of local, state, tribal, and even federal public health agencies. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the legislature had initiated action to address the critical challenges Washington's public health system faces, including limited organizational capacity, financial resources, and understaffing through beginning to specifically fund foundational public health services. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the shortcomings of Washington's current public health system which have been studied and identified for over a decade. Washington's current public health system was not able to consistently monitor and track the pandemic, staff the many required missions, adequately address the health inequities, and implement standard approaches to disease containment.

The legislature further finds that, in Washington, local health services are currently provided through a decentralized means by 35 local health jurisdictions. In many cases, rural communities are served by smaller local health jurisdictions that have less capacity to provide the full spectrum of foundational public health services than their urban peers. Local health jurisdictions serving smaller populations face challenges providing the full spectrum of foundational public health services and activities to promote and protect the health of all people. In addition, local health jurisdictions are overseen by boards in which most the members do not have direct experience in public health or health care. Since April 2020, a Kaiser health news investigation reports at least 181 local and state health leaders have resigned, retired, or been fired, including 11 local health leaders in Washington. Diseases do not respect borders or boundaries, yet the current decentralized system in Washington creates a patchwork approach with limited accountability and consistency. National peer-review studies report larger jurisdictions perform better on most foundational comprehensive public health services. Therefore, the legislature finds comprehensive public health districts comprising larger populations, balanced governance, and interdependence between all levels of the public health system will increase accountability, effectiveness, and performance in delivering foundational public health services.

The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the health and social inequities in Washington that existed before its emergence. There are vast inequities in per capita spending for local public health services by population size and geographic location. National peer-review studies report communities with limited public health systems experience low levels of activity participation, low perceived effectiveness, and sparse organizational networks compared to comprehensive public health systems. The inequitable distribution of morbidity and mortality between Black, indigenous, and people of color and other populations demonstrates the large health inequities that must be addressed. Therefore, the legislature finds the state must determine adequate funding of comprehensive public health districts from cities, counties, and the state, with the goal of providing all people with equitable access to foundational public health services, and once this funding is determined, the legislature finds this investment in the public's health will continue to be prioritized.

The legislature recognizes that public health and health care staff have been overwhelmed, overworked and their mental and physical health are at risk due to the pandemic. The legislature is thankful for the countless contributions that public health and health care staff have made to combat this deadly public health crisis and pandemic. These contributions and efforts have increased public awareness about the importance of strong infrastructure for our public health system. Therefore, the legislature finds that meaningful discourse about the current public health system is necessary to ensure public trust.

The legislature expects emergencies that threaten the health and well-being of all Washingtonians, emergent and routine, to increase. Restructuring state funding of foundational public health services is not enough to face these threats. The legislature intends for Washington to have a public health system that can respond to 21st century public health emergencies and public health issues, have the capacity to improve health outcomes of BIPOC communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ+, rural communities, limited English-speaking persons, and address health equity across the life span.

    a. The legislature finds that the mortality rate in Washington state among infants and children less than eighteen years of age is unacceptably high, and that such mortality may be preventable. The legislature further finds that, through the performance of child mortality reviews, preventable causes of child mortality can be identified and addressed, thereby reducing the infant and child mortality in Washington state.

    b. It is the intent of the legislature to encourage the performance of child death reviews by **district** health departments by providing necessary legal protections to the families of children whose deaths are studied, **district** health department officials and employees, and health care professionals participating in child mortality review committee activities.

2. As used in this section, "child mortality review" means a process authorized by a **district** health department as such department is defined in RCW 70.05.010 for examining factors that contribute to deaths of children less than eighteen years of age. The process may include a systematic review of medical, clinical, and hospital records; home interviews of parents and caretakers of children who have died; analysis of individual case information; and review of this information by a team of professionals in order to identify modifiable medical, socioeconomic, public health, behavioral, administrative, educational, and environmental factors associated with each death.

This provision does not restrict or limit the discovery or subpoena from a health care provider of records or documents maintained by such health care provider in the ordinary course of business, whether or not such records or documents may have been supplied to a **district** health department pursuant to this section. This provision shall not restrict or limit the discovery or subpoena of documents from such witnesses simply because a copy of a document was collected as part of a child mortality review.

    d. No **district** health department official or employee, and no members of technical committees established to perform case reviews of selected child deaths may be examined in any administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding as to the existence or contents of documents assembled, prepared, or maintained for purposes of a child mortality review.

Upon the issuance of a health order pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the state or **district** health officer shall give written notice promptly, personally, and confidentially to the person who is the subject of the order stating the grounds and provisions of the order, including the factual bases therefor, the evidence relied upon for proof of infection and dangerous behavior, and the likelihood of repetition of such behaviors in the absence of such an order. The written notice must inform the person who is the subject of the order that, if he or she contests the order, he or she may file an appeal and appear at a judicial hearing on the enforceability of the order, to be held in superior court. The hearing shall be held within seventy-two hours of receipt of the notice, unless the person subject to the order agrees to comply. If the person contests the order, no invasive medical procedures shall be carried out prior to a hearing being held pursuant to this subsection.

    c. At a hearing held pursuant to (a) or (b) of this subsection (5), the person subject to the health order may have an attorney appear on his or her behalf at public expense, if necessary. The burden of proof shall be on the health officer to show by clear and convincing evidence that the specified grounds exist for the issuance of the order and for the need for compliance and that the terms and conditions imposed therein are no more restrictive than necessary to protect the public health. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the court shall issue appropriate orders affirming, modifying, or dismissing the health order.

    d. If the superior court dismisses the health order, the fact that the order was issued shall be expunged from the records of the department or **district** department of health.


## Section 41
> This section modifies existing section [70.24.034](/rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.024_control_and_treatment_of_sexually_transmitted_diseases.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70_public_health_and_safety/70.024_control_and_treatment_of_sexually_transmitted_diseases.md) for context.

1. When the procedures of RCW 70.24.024 have been exhausted and the state or **district** health officer, within his or her respective jurisdiction, knows or has reason to believe, because of medical information, that a person has a sexually transmitted disease and that the person continues to engage in behaviors that present an imminent danger to the public health as defined by the board by rule based upon generally accepted standards of medical and public health science, the public health officer may bring an action in superior court to detain the person in a facility designated by the board for a period of time necessary to accomplish a program of counseling and education, excluding any coercive techniques or procedures, designed to get the person to adopt nondangerous behavior. In no case may the period exceed ninety days under each order. The board shall establish, by rule, standards for counseling and education under this subsection. The public health officer shall request the prosecuting attorney to file such action in superior court. During that period, reasonable efforts will be made in a noncoercive manner to get the person to adopt nondangerous behavior.

2. If an action is filed as outlined in subsection (1) of this section, the superior court, upon the petition of the prosecuting attorney, shall issue other appropriate court orders including, but not limited to, an order to take the person into custody immediately, for a period not to exceed seventy-two hours, and place him or her in a facility designated or approved by the board. The person who is the subject of the order shall be given written notice of the order promptly, personally, and confidentially, stating the grounds and provisions of the order, including the factual bases therefor, the evidence relied upon for proof of infection and dangerous behavior, and the likelihood of repetition of such behaviors in the absence of such an order, and notifying the person that if he or she refuses to comply with the order he or she may appear at a hearing to review the order and that he or she may have an attorney appear on his or her behalf in the hearing at public expense, if necessary. If the person contests testing or treatment, no invasive medical procedures shall be carried out prior to a hearing being held pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.

3. The hearing shall be conducted no later than forty-eight hours after the receipt of the order. The person who is subject to the order has a right to be present at the hearing and may have an attorney appear on his or her behalf in the hearing, at public expense if necessary. If the order being contested includes detention for a period of fourteen days or longer, the person shall also have the right to a trial by jury upon request. Upon conclusion of the hearing or trial by jury, the court shall issue appropriate orders.

The court may continue the hearing upon the request of the person who is subject to the order for good cause shown for no more than five additional judicial days. If a trial by jury is requested, the court, upon motion, may continue the hearing for no more than ten additional judicial days. During the pendency of the continuance, the court may order that the person contesting the order remain in detention or may place terms and conditions upon the person which the court deems appropriate to protect public health.

4. The burden of proof shall be on the state or **district** health officer to show by clear and convincing evidence that grounds exist for the issuance of any court order pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section. If the superior court dismisses the order, the fact that the order was issued shall be expunged from the records of the state or **district** department of health.

5. Any hearing conducted by the superior court pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section shall be closed and confidential unless a public hearing is requested by the person who is the subject of the order, in which case the hearing will be conducted in open court. Unless in open hearing, any transcripts or records relating thereto shall also be confidential and may be sealed by order of the court.

6. Any order entered by the superior court pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall impose terms and conditions no more restrictive than necessary to protect the public health.
