# Substitute House Bill 1152 as Recommended by Health Care & Wellness

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1152-S.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds the COVID-19 pandemic has been the most difficult challenge in Washington's public health history since the 1918 flu pandemic. More Americans have died from COVID-19 than the number of United States troops killed in combat during World War II. The COVID-19 pandemic response has stressed and strained every part of our society and far surpassed the capabilities of local, state, tribal, and even federal public health agencies. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the legislature had initiated action to address the critical challenges Washington's public health system faces, including limited organizational capacity, financial resources, and understaffing through beginning to specifically fund foundational public health services. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the shortcomings of Washington's current public health system which have been studied and identified for over a decade. Washington's current public health system was not able to consistently monitor and track the pandemic, staff the many required missions, adequately address the health inequities, and implement standard approaches to disease containment.

The legislature further finds that, in Washington, local health services are currently provided through a decentralized means by 35 local health jurisdictions. In many cases, rural communities are served by smaller local health jurisdictions that have less capacity to provide the full spectrum of foundational public health services than their urban peers. Local health jurisdictions serving smaller populations face challenges providing the full spectrum of foundational public health services and activities to promote and protect the health of all people. In addition, local health jurisdictions are overseen by boards in which most the members do not have direct experience in public health or health care. Since April 2020, a Kaiser health news investigation reports at least 181 local and state health leaders have resigned, retired, or been fired, including 11 local health leaders in Washington. Diseases do not respect borders or boundaries, yet the current decentralized system in Washington creates a patchwork approach with limited accountability and consistency. National peer-review studies report larger jurisdictions perform better on most foundational comprehensive public health services.

The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the health and social inequities in Washington that existed before its emergence. There are vast inequities in per capita spending for local public health services by population size and geographic location. National peer-review studies report communities with limited public health systems experience low levels of activity participation, low perceived effectiveness, and sparse organizational networks compared to comprehensive public health systems. The inequitable distribution of morbidity and mortality between Black, indigenous, and people of color and other populations demonstrates the large health inequities that must be addressed. Therefore, the legislature finds the state must determine adequate funding of comprehensive health services districts from cities, counties, and the state, with the goal of providing all people with equitable access to foundational public health services, and once this funding is determined, the legislature finds this investment in the public's health will continue to be prioritized.

The legislature recognizes that public health and health care staff have been overwhelmed, overworked, and their mental and physical health are at risk due to the pandemic. The legislature is thankful for the countless contributions that public health and health care staff have made to combat this deadly public health crisis and pandemic. These contributions and efforts have increased public awareness about the importance of strong infrastructure for our public health system. Therefore, the legislature finds that meaningful discourse about the current public health system is necessary to ensure public trust.

The legislature expects emergencies that threaten the health and well-being of all Washingtonians, emergent and routine, to increase. Restructuring state funding of foundational public health services is not enough to face these threats. The legislature intends for Washington to have a public health system that can respond to 21st century public health emergencies and public health issues, have the capacity to improve health outcomes of BIPOC communities, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ+, rural communities, limited English-speaking persons, and address health equity across the life span.
