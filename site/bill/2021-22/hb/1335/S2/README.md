# Second Substitute House Bill 1335 as Recommended by Appropriations

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1335-S2.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that the existence of racial, religious, or ethnic-based property restrictions or covenants on a deed or chain of title for real property is like having a monument to racism on that property and is repugnant to the tenets of equality. Furthermore, such restrictions and covenants may cause mental anguish and tarnish a property owner's sense of ownership in the property because the owner feels as though they have participated in a racist act themselves.

It is the intent of the legislature that the owner, occupant, or tenant or homeowners' association board of the property which is subject to an unlawful deed restriction or covenant pursuant to RCW 49.60.224 is entitled to have discriminatory covenants and restrictions that are contrary to public policy struck from their chain of title. The legislature has presented two ways this can be accomplished through RCW 49.60.227(1) (a) and (b). If the owner, occupant, or tenant or homeowners' association board of the property elects to pursue a judicial remedy, the legislature intends that the court issue a declaratory judgment ordering the county auditor, or in charter counties the county official charged with the responsibility for recording instruments in the county records, to entirely strike the racist or otherwise discriminatory covenants from the chain of title. Striking the language does not prevent preservation of the original record, outside of the chain of title, for historical or archival purposes.

The legislature finds that striking racist, religious, and ethnic restrictions or covenants from the chain of title is no different than having an offensive statutory monument which the owner may entirely remove. So too should the owner be able to entirely remove the offensive written monument to racism or other unconstitutional discrimination.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [43.330](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.330_department_of_commerce.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.330_department_of_commerce.md) for context.

1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department shall establish and administer a grant program to review existing recorded covenants and deed restrictions to identify those recorded documents that include racial or other restrictions unlawful under RCW 49.60.224 and provide notice to property owners of such restrictions.

2. The department shall establish a process for accepting grant applications from public and private not-for-profit higher education institutions that are regionally accredited, including application guidelines and deadlines. The department shall begin awarding grants no later than January 1, 2022.

3. The higher education institutions selected to participate in the grant program shall review existing recorded covenants and deed restrictions to identify those recorded documents that include racial or other restrictions on property ownership or use against protected classes that are unlawful under RCW 49.60.224. Higher education institutions shall provide notification to each property owner who owns property subject to such racial or other unlawful restrictions and the county auditor of the county within which the restrictions were found. Selected higher education institutions are encouraged to utilize students, including law and graduate students, to complete the requirements of the grant program as part of educational and training programs.

4. This section expires July 1, 2027.

1. [Empty]

    a. If a written instrument contains a provision that is void by reason of RCW 49.60.224, the owner, occupant, or tenant of the property which is subject to the provision or the homeowners' association board may cause the provision to be stricken from the public records by bringing an action in the superior court in the county in which the property is located. The action shall be an in rem, declaratory judgment action whose title shall be the description of the property. The necessary party to the action shall be the owner, occupant, or tenant of the property or any portion thereof. The person bringing the action shall pay a fee set under RCW 36.18.012.

    b. If the court finds that any provisions of the written instrument are void under RCW 49.60.224, it shall enter an order striking the void provisions from the public records and eliminating the void provisions from the title or lease of the property described in the complaint. **The person bringing the action shall deliver the order by email, certified United States mail, or personally to the office of the county auditor, or in charter counties the county official charged with the responsibility for recording instruments in the county records, in the county in which the property is located. The auditor or official shall remove the void provisions entirely from the chain of title by removing the record from the chain of title if feasible, or by striking it through and including the order in the chain of title. A record removed from the chain of title may be preserved for historical or archival purposes.**

    d. The effective date of the modification document shall be the same as the effective date of the original written instrument.

    e. If the owner causes to be recorded a modification document that contains modifications not authorized by this section, the county auditor or recording officer shall not incur liability for recording the document. Any liability that may result is the sole responsibility of the owner who caused the recordation.

    f. No filing or recording fees or otherwise authorized surcharges shall be required for the filing of a modification document pursuant to this section.
