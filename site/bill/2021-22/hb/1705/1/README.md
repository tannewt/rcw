# House Bill 1705

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1705.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that ghost guns are untraceable and unregulated firearms that lack a unique serial number that would allow them to be traced to a specific manufacturer, dealer, and purchaser. The absence of a serial number on ghost guns undermines the ability of law enforcement to identify individuals who have used such guns in the commission of a crime, which incentivizes the use of ghost guns in criminal acts, makes it easier for criminals to evade detection and employ lethal force, and endangers public safety.

The legislature further finds that ghost guns are often manufactured or assembled by unlicensed individuals who could not pass a background check and lawfully obtain a firearm, and that such individuals often purchase unfinished frames or receivers (also known as 80 percent receivers) and build-it-yourself ghost gun kits from unregulated online sellers, in retail stores, and at gun shows. Such kits typically contain all the parts, tools, and instructions needed to assemble a ghost gun, and are designed to enable untrained individuals to readily assemble ghost guns with common household tools in a matter of hours, regardless of whether that individual could lawfully purchase or obtain a firearm.

The legislature further finds the proliferation of ghost guns, ghost gun kits, and untraceable unfinished frames and receivers threatens public safety. Nationwide, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives reported that about 10,000 ghost guns were recovered in 2019. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 23,000 unserialized firearms were recovered by law enforcement from potential crime scenes, including 325 homicide or attempted homicide crime scenes. Nationally, untraceable ghost guns have been used to perpetrate mass shootings, attack law enforcement officers, and commit robbery and assault. Ghost guns are becoming increasingly prevalent throughout the west coast and across the United States.

The legislature further finds that Washington currently imposes few restrictions on untraceable firearms and concludes Washington law must be updated to limit the spread of ghost guns and mitigate the harms caused by these weapons.

The legislature intends this act to be interpreted in a manner consistent with existing federal firearm laws and regulations, and proposed federal rule 2021R-05, updating 27 C.F.R. Parts 447, 478, and 479,Â published in the federal register (Vol. 86, No. 97) on May 21, 2021.
