## Section 5
The legislature finds that in March 2020, congress enacted the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (CARES act), which created the coronavirus relief fund to assist states with unanticipated and unbudgeted coronavirus response costs, and that such funding had to be spent by December 30, 2020, or returned to the federal treasury. The legislature finds that the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act (CRRSA act) enacted December 27, 2020, extended the deadline during in which coronavirus relief funds could be spent until December 31, 2021. The legislature finds the deadline extension provides an opportunity to reevaluate previous state expenditures of coronavirus relief funds. It is in the best interest of Washingtonians to maximize available federal funding from the coronavirus relief fund to the full extent permitted by federal law and to recognize its flexibility as a fund source to address the urgent needs of Washington's residents and businesses during the pandemic. For these reasons, in sections 3 and 4 of this act, the legislature revises 2019-2021 biennial appropriations, including appropriations for fiscal year 2020, for funding provided to the developmental disabilities and aging and adult services programs in the department of social and health services for temporary rate increases authorized for service providers and other costs incurred as a result of the state's response to the coronavirus. Specifically, appropriations are revised to attribute these expenditures to the state funding from the state budget stabilization account and associated medicaid federal funds participation, rather than to federal funding from the coronavirus relief fund. The federal coronavirus relief fund moneys made available by the revisions in sections 3 and 4 of this act are appropriated in section 1 of this act for the benefit of Washington's residents and businesses and to accelerate a lasting recovery for all Washingtonians.
