## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [28A.635.060](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.635_offenses_relating_to_school_property_and_personnel.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.635_offenses_relating_to_school_property_and_personnel.md) for context.

1. Any pupil who defaces or otherwise injures any school property, or property belonging to a school contractor, employee, or another student, is subject to suspension and punishment. If any property of the school district, a contractor of the district, an employee, or another student has been lost or willfully cut, defaced, or injured, the school district may withhold the grades, diploma, and transcripts of the pupil responsible for the damage or loss until the pupil or the pupil's parent or guardian has paid for the damages**, except that the school district must release the pupil's grades and transcripts three years after the pupil exits the school district**. If the student is suspended, the student may not be readmitted until the student or parents or legal guardian has made payment in full or until directed by the superintendent of schools. If the property damaged is a school bus owned and operated by or contracted to any school district, a student suspended for the damage may not be permitted to enter or ride any school bus until the student or parent or legal guardian has made payment in full or until directed by the superintendent. When the pupil and parent or guardian are unable to pay for the damages, the school district shall provide a program of **community service opportunities** for the pupil **instead** of the payment of monetary damages. Upon completion of **community service** the grades, diploma, and transcripts of the pupil shall be released. The parent or guardian of such pupil shall be liable for damages as otherwise provided by law.

2. **When informing either the pupil or the pupil's parent or guardian that the pupil's grades, diploma, or transcripts are being withheld as allowed under subsection (1) of this section, a school district must provide the following information:**

    a. **The school district may waive the payment of the monetary damage in part or in full;**

    b. **The pupil may make the payment of monetary damages;**

    c. **The pupil may participate in a program of community service opportunities for the pupil instead of the payment of monetary damages; and**

    d. **The school district must release the pupil's grades and transcripts three years after the pupil exits the school district. When the pupil has already exited the school district, the school district must inform the pupil of the date on which the school district is obligated to release the pupil's grades and transcripts.**

3. Before any penalties are assessed under this section, a school district board of directors shall adopt procedures which insure that pupils' rights to due process are protected.

4. If the department of social and health services or a child-placing agency licensed by the department has been granted custody of a child, that child's records, if requested by the department or agency, are not to be withheld for nonpayment of school fees or any other reason.
