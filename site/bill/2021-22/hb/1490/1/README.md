# House Bill 1490

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1490.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature declares that access to energy undergirds Washington's economic resilience and public health outcomes. Energy is a crucial service that Washingtonians need in order to secure an education, participate in the economy, and stay safe and healthy.

2. The legislature finds that during the COVID-19 crisis, access to energy, as protected by proclamations delivered by the governor and shut-off moratoria issued by the utilities and transportation commission, reduced COVID-19 infections by 4.4 percent and mortality rates by 7.4 percent. These protections are due to expire April 30, 2021, at which point many Washingtonians risk losing access to life-preserving energy services.

3. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to strengthen Washington's economic resilience and public health outcomes by prohibiting utility service termination for residential electricity and heating due to nonpayment for low-income households and households with people with disabilities.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [19.29A](/rcw/19_business_regulations—miscellaneous/19.029A_consumers_of_electricity.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/19_business_regulations—miscellaneous/19.029A_consumers_of_electricity.md) for context.

The following requirements apply to an irrigation district formed under chapter 87.03 RCW, a cooperative formed under chapter 23.86 RCW, or a mutual corporation or association formed under chapter 24.06 RCW, that is engaged in the business of distributing electricity to more than one retail electric customer in the state:

1. A utility providing service for residential space heating or residential electric light may not terminate such utility service between November 15th through March 15th for any residential customer, regardless of household income or disability status, if the customer:

    a. Notifies the utility of the inability to pay the bill, including a security deposit. This notice should be provided within five business days of receiving a payment overdue notice unless there are extenuating circumstances. If the customer fails to notify the utility within five business days and service is terminated, the customer can, by paying reconnection charges, if any, and fulfilling the requirements of this section, receive the protections of this chapter;

    b. Provides self-certification of household income for the prior 12 months to a grantee of the department of commerce. The grantee must determine the household income and shall provide a dollar figure that is seven percent of household income. The grantee may verify information in the self-certification;

    c. Has applied or will apply for home heating assistance from applicable government and private sector organizations, if eligible, and certifies that any assistance received will be applied to the current bill and future utility bills;

    d. Agrees to a payment plan and agrees to maintain the payment plan. The plan must be designed both to pay the past due bill by the following October 15th and to pay for continued utility service. If the past due bill is not paid by the following October 15th, the customer is not eligible for protections under this chapter until the past due bill is paid. The plan may not require monthly payments in excess of seven percent of the customer's monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter during November 15th through March 15th. A customer may agree to pay a higher percentage during this period, but shall not be in default unless payment during this period is less than seven percent of monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter. If assistance payments are received by the customer subsequent to implementation of the plan, the customer shall contact the utility to reformulate the plan; and

    e. Agrees to pay the moneys owed even if he or she moves.

2. [Empty]

    a. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, utility service for both residential space heating and residential electric light may not be terminated at any time due to delinquent or unpaid charges for low-income households or households with people with disabilities. The customer responsible for the utility bill:

        i. Must notify the utility of the inability to pay the bill within seven business days of receiving a payment overdue notice, unless there are extenuating circumstances;

        ii. Must provide self-certification of either household income for the prior 12 months or household disability status, or both, to a grantee of the department of commerce. The grantee must determine that the household meets the definition of "low-income" as provided in RCW 19.405.020 or the definition of "disability" as provided in RCW 49.60.040. The grantee must provide a dollar figure that is three percent of household income. The grantee may verify information in the self-certification;

        iii. May apply for energy assistance from applicable government and private sector organizations. The customer must certify that any energy assistance received will be applied to the customer's current bill and future utility bills;

        iv. May apply for low-income weatherization assistance to the utility or other appropriate agency, if such assistance is available for the dwelling;

    v. Must agree to a payment plan and agree to maintain the payment plan. The plan may not require monthly payments in excess of three percent of the customer's monthly income. The customer may agree to pay a higher percentage during this period, but is not in default unless payment during this period is less than three percent of monthly income. If assistance payments are received by the customer subsequent to implementation of the plan, the customer must contact the utility to reformulate the plan; and

    vi. Must agree to pay the moneys owed even if the customer moves.

    b. The utility may terminate service under this subsection only if household net usage over six consecutive months exceeds 200 percent of average residential household usage in the utility's service area, or 15 megawatt-hours or 800 therms, whichever is greater.

3. The utility must:

    a. Include in any notice that an account is delinquent and that service may be subject to termination, and a description of the customer's duties in this section;

    b. Assist the customer in fulfilling the requirements under this section including, but not limited to, providing the customer with information on energy assistance programs for which the customer may be eligible;

    c. Be authorized to transfer an account to a new residence when a customer who has established a plan under this section moves from one residence to another within the same utility service area;

    d. Be permitted to disconnect service if the customer fails to honor the payment program, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section. Utilities may continue to disconnect service for those practices authorized by law other than for nonpayment as provided for in this section. Customers who qualify for payment plans under this section who default on their payment plans and are disconnected may be reconnected and maintain the protections afforded under this chapter by reestablishing and making payments towards a payment plan as provided under subsection (1)(d) or (2)(a)(v) of this section; and

    e. Advise the customer in writing and conduct an on-site, in-person visit, and be willing to accept payment at that time, with translation and accessibility service as necessary prior to disconnecting service. The utility will restore service if the customer contacts the utility and fulfills the other requirements of this section.

4. Each utility must offer residential customers the option of a budget billing or equal payment plan. The budget billing or equal payment plan must be offered to low-income customers without limiting availability to certain months of the year, without regard to the length of time the customer has occupied the premises, and without regard to whether the customer is the tenant or owner of the premises occupied. For the purposes of this subsection, "low-income" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 19.405.020.

5. An agreement between the customer and the utility, whether oral or written, does not waive the protections afforded under this chapter.
