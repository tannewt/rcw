# Substitute House Bill 1866 as Recommended by Health Care & Wellness

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1866-S.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The epidemic of homelessness apparent in communities throughout Washington is creating immense suffering. It is threatening the health of homeless families and individuals, sapping their human potential, eroding public confidence, and undermining the shared values that have driven our state's prosperity, including public safety and access to public streets, parks, and facilities;

    b. In seeking to identify the causes of this epidemic, a large proportion of those unsheltered also suffer from serious behavioral health or physical health conditions that will inevitably grow worse without timely and effective health care;

    c. Housing is an indispensable element of effective health care. Stable housing is a prerequisite to addressing behavioral health needs and lack of housing is a precursor to poor health outcomes;

    d. A home, health care, and wellness are fundamental for Washington residents;

    e. Reducing homelessness is a priority of the people of Washington state and that reducing homelessness through policy alignment and reform lessens fiscal impact to the state and improves the economic vitality of our businesses;

    f. The impact of this epidemic is falling most heavily on those communities that already suffer the most serious health disparities: Black, indigenous, people of color, and historically marginalized and underserved communities. It is a moral imperative to shelter chronically homeless populations; and

    g. Washington state has many of the tools needed to address this challenge, including a network of safety net health and behavioral health care providers in both urban and rural areas, an effective system of health care coverage through apple health, and excellent public and nonprofit affordable housing providers. Yet far too many homeless families and individuals are going without the housing and health care resources they need because these tools have yet to be combined in an effective way across the state.

2. It is the intent of the legislature to treat chronic homelessness as a medical condition and that the apple health and homes act address the needs of chronically homeless populations by pairing a health care problem with a health care solution.

1. The apple health and homes program is established to provide a permanent supportive housing benefit that is renewable in 12-month periods for persons assessed with specific health needs and risk factors. The program shall operate through the submission of housing benefit authorizations issued by a coordinating entity to the office on behalf of persons who meet the eligibility standards established in subsection (2) of this section, as may be adjusted in accordance with federal standards for providing funding for community support services.

    v. Have at least one chronic condition and have been determined by the authority to be at risk for a second chronic condition as determined by the use of a predictive risk scoring tool that considers the person's age, gender, diagnosis, and medications.

3. To inform eligibility for the program, the authority shall implement a screening process to identify and consider social determinants of health domains in addition to housing. Other social determinants of health domains include, but are not limited to, food security, transportation, financial strain, and interpersonal safety. The authority shall select an accredited or nationally vetted tool, including criteria for prioritization, for the coordinating entity to use to screen individuals and make the determination for the housing benefit. This screening and prioritization process should not exclude clients transitioning from inpatient or other behavioral health residential treatment settings. When selecting and implementing a tool, the authority shall seek to support and align with other statewide initiatives to identify and address social needs, including efforts within the 1115 waiver renewal to advance health equity and health-related supports.

4. Once a coordinating entity verifies that a person has met the eligibility criteria established in subsection (2) of this section, it must determine the person's specific housing needs to assure that the permanent supportive housing option is appropriate and safe for the person. The coordinating entity must submit the housing benefit authorization, including the suitable housing assessment, to the office.

5. A housing benefit authorization is valid for at least 12 months and must be renewed in accordance with the eligibility standards in subsection (2) of this section, except that the standards related to homelessness shall be replaced with an assessment of the person's likelihood to become homeless in the event that the housing benefit authorization expires. The coordinating entity must adopt procedures to conduct annual housing benefit authorization renewals, according to authority standards, and submit the results to the office.
