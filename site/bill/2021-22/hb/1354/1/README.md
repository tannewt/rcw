## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the work of the state suicide prevention plan steering committee has produced a valuable, comprehensive suicide prevention plan. This plan finds that about one-half of mental health conditions appear by age 14 and identifies a need for preventing youth suicide risk farther upstream in a child's life.

2. The legislature intends to establish a youth suicide review team to complement the work of the state suicide prevention plan steering committee by providing a focused investigation of the lives of youth who have died by suicide. The work of the review team shall:

    a. Provide a more detailed picture of the lives of youth who have died by suicide in Washington to allow for more targeted intervention programs to reach youth earlier in their lives; and

    b. Help determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic or the state's response to the pandemic have impacted youth suicide rates.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [43.70](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.070_department_of_health.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.070_department_of_health.md) for context.

1. The department shall establish the Washington youth suicide review team to review the circumstances related to suicides occurring among youth up to age 24. The Washington youth suicide review shall:

    a. Perform an in-depth review of each instance of persons under 24 years old who have died by suicide in Washington during the 2020 calendar year. The review may not include suicides that occur within the boundaries of an Indian reservation if the tribal government opposes the review;

    b. Analyze circumstances affecting the lives of the persons who have been reviewed to ascertain the existence of any common factors that may have contributed to the persons' suicide. The analysis may include a systematic review of medical records, including mental health information, home interviews of parents and caretakers of the person, analysis of individual case information, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the state's response to the pandemic; and

    c. Compile statistics to establish a description of the lives of youth in Washington who have died by suicide and recommendations for targeting intervention programs to reach youth at risk for suicide earlier in life.

2. [Empty]

    a. The Washington youth suicide review team consists of the following members appointed by the governor, with the advice of the secretary of health:

4. [Empty]

    a. All health care information collected as part of the Washington youth suicide review team is confidential, subject to the restrictions on disclosure provided for in chapter 70.02 RCW. When documents are collected as part of the work of the Washington youth suicide review team, the records may be used solely by the review team and the department of health for the purposes of supporting the activities of the review team.

    b. No identifying information related to the deceased person, the person's guardians, or anyone interviewed as part of the work of the Washington youth suicide review team may be disclosed. Any such information shall be redacted from any records produced as part of the review team's activities.

    c. Any witness statements or documents collected from witnesses, or summaries or analyses of those statements or records prepared exclusively for purposes of the Washington youth suicide review team, are not subject to public disclosure, discovery, subpoena, or introduction into evidence in any administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding related to the death of a person reviewed. This provision does not restrict or limit the discovery or subpoena from a health care provider of records or documents maintained by such health care provider in the ordinary course of business, whether or not such records or documents may have been supplied to a local health department pursuant to this section. This provision does not restrict or limit the discovery or subpoena of documents from such witnesses simply because a copy of a document was collected as part of the Washington youth suicide review team.

5. The Washington youth suicide review team shall report its findings and recommendations to the governor and the committees of the legislature with jurisdiction over issues related to suicide prevention for youth by June 1, 2023. The report must include information regarding the feasibility of establishing locally based youth suicide review teams. Any compilation of data must be summarized in a manner so as to prevent the identification of any specific person who was the subject of review.
