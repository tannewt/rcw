[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2075-S2.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that establishing minimum service requirements for the department of social and health services is necessary due to the increase in call center wait times due to the closure of department offices during the COVID-19 public health emergency, resulting in individuals being unable to access safety net programs at the department.

2. The legislature intends to establish minimum service expectations and requirements to ensure that eligible individuals receive needed services through the department of social and health services. The legislature further intends to prohibit the department from imposing punitive measures against individuals when they are unable to comply with the requirements the department imposes for individuals to maintain benefits if they are unable to interact with the department due to operating decisions made by the department, such as the closure of community service offices.
