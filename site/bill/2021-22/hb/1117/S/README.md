# Substitute House Bill 1117 as Recommended by Environment & Energy

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1117-S.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Salmon and other anadromous fish have a special historical, economic, and cultural importance to Washington;

    b. As a consequence of their centrality to treaty-protected rights reserved to Indian tribes, and the efforts required to be undertaken in order to preserve those rights and recover threatened and endangered species, the preservation and recovery of salmonid populations is a uniquely important legislative priority;

    c. Nontribal commercial and recreational fishing and salmon viewing contribute significantly to the economic and social stability and well-being of Washington residents; and

    d. Ensuring that future development, redevelopment, and population growth are compatible with the long-term survival and recovery of anadromous fish species is essential to Washington's continued vibrancy and quality of life.

2. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support the protection of salmon through:

    a. The adoption and state support of net ecological gain at the WRIA scale and incorporation of applicable elements of the local salmon recovery plan through local government growth and shoreline planning efforts;

    b. Ensuring that proportional compensatory mitigation for impacts that are predicted to occur over the expected life of the project to wetlands, water, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and other elements of the environment that affect salmon habitat achieves its desired outcomes; and

    c. Providing local governments the full resources needed in the form of funding and technical support to achieve the goals and requirements of this act.

The advancement of ecological function and achievement of net ecological gain within each WRIA or independent natural drainage that flows directly into marine waters will occur through the appropriate selection and implementation of publicly funded projects, including voluntary grant programs, salmon recovery projects, ecological improvements made through the municipal stormwater permit process, and investments made as a result of the capital facilities element and transportation element of the comprehensive plan.**

19. "Permanent supportive housing" is subsidized, leased housing with no limit on length of stay that prioritizes people who need comprehensive support services to retain tenancy and utilizes admissions practices designed to use lower barriers to entry than would be typical for other subsidized or unsubsidized rental housing, especially related to rental history, criminal history, and personal behaviors. Permanent supportive housing is paired with on-site or off-site voluntary services designed to support a person living with a complex and disabling behavioral health or physical health condition who was experiencing homelessness or was at imminent risk of homelessness prior to moving into housing to retain their housing and be a successful tenant in a housing arrangement, improve the resident's health status, and connect the resident of the housing with community-based health care, treatment, or employment services.

21. "Public services" include fire protection and suppression, law enforcement, public health, education, recreation, environmental protection, and other governmental services.

22. "Rural character" refers to the patterns of land use and development established by a county in the rural element of its comprehensive plan:

    a. In which open space, the natural landscape, and vegetation predominate over the built environment;

    b. That foster traditional rural lifestyles, rural-based economies, and opportunities to both live and work in rural areas;

    c. That provide visual landscapes that are traditionally found in rural areas and communities;

    d. That are compatible with the use of the land by wildlife **,** for fish and wildlife habitat**, and with the achievement of net ecological gain**;

    e. That reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development;

    f. That generally do not require the extension of urban governmental services; and

    g. That are consistent with the protection **and restoration** of natural surface water flows and groundwater and surface water recharge and discharge areas.

23. "Rural development" refers to development outside the urban growth area and outside agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.170. Rural development can consist of a variety of uses and residential densities, including clustered residential development, at levels that are consistent with the preservation of rural character and the requirements of the rural element. Rural development does not refer to agriculture or forestry activities that may be conducted in rural areas.

24. "Rural governmental services" or "rural services" include those public services and public facilities historically and typically delivered at an intensity usually found in rural areas, and may include domestic water systems, fire and police protection services, transportation and public transit services, and other public utilities associated with rural development and normally not associated with urban areas.

27. "Urban growth" refers to growth that makes intensive use of land for the location of buildings, structures, and impermeable surfaces to such a degree as to be incompatible with the primary use of land for the production of food, other agricultural products, or fiber, or the extraction of mineral resources, rural uses, rural development, and natural resource lands designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.170. A pattern of more intensive rural development, as provided in RCW 36.70A.070(5)(d), is not urban growth. When allowed to spread over wide areas, urban growth typically requires urban governmental services. "Characterized by urban growth" refers to land having urban growth located on it, or to land located in relationship to an area with urban growth on it as to be appropriate for urban growth.

28. "Urban growth areas" means those areas designated by a county pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110.

29. "Very low-income household" means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is at or below fifty percent of the median household income adjusted for household size, for the county where the household is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development.

31. "Wetland" or "wetlands" means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [36.70A.020](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

The following goals are adopted to guide the development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations of those counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040. The following goals are not listed in order of priority and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of guiding the development of comprehensive plans and development regulations:

1. Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas where adequate public facilities and services exist or can be provided in an efficient manner.

2. Reduce sprawl. Reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development.

3. Transportation. Encourage efficient multimodal transportation systems that are based on regional priorities and coordinated with county and city comprehensive plans.

4. Housing. Encourage the availability of affordable housing to all economic segments of the population of this state, promote a variety of residential densities and housing types, and encourage preservation of existing housing stock.

5. Economic development. Encourage economic development throughout the state that is consistent with adopted comprehensive plans, promote economic opportunity for all citizens of this state, especially for unemployed and for disadvantaged persons, promote the retention and expansion of existing businesses and recruitment of new businesses, recognize regional differences impacting economic development opportunities, and encourage growth in areas experiencing insufficient economic growth, all within the capacities of the state's natural resources, public services, and public facilities.

6. Property rights. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation having been made. The property rights of landowners shall be protected from arbitrary and discriminatory actions.

7. Permits. Applications for both state and local government permits should be processed in a timely and fair manner to ensure predictability.

8. Natural resource industries. Maintain and enhance natural resource-based industries, including productive timber, agricultural, and fisheries industries. Encourage the conservation of productive forestlands and productive agricultural lands, and discourage incompatible uses.

9. Open space and recreation. Retain open space**;** enhance recreational opportunities**;** conserve**, protect, restore, and achieve net ecological gain with respect to** fish and wildlife habitat**in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this act;** increase access to natural resource lands and water**;** and develop parks and recreation facilities.

10. Environment. Protect**, restore, and achieve net ecological gain to** the environment **in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this act** and enhance the state's high quality of life, including air and water quality,  the availability of water**, and fish and wildlife habitat**.

11. Citizen participation and coordination. Encourage the involvement of citizens in the planning process and ensure coordination between communities and jurisdictions to reconcile conflicts.

12. Public facilities and services. Ensure that those public facilities and services necessary to support development shall be adequate to serve the development at the time the development is available for occupancy and use without decreasing current service levels below locally established minimum standards.

13. Historic preservation. Identify and encourage the preservation of lands, sites, and structures, that have historical or archaeological significance.

14. **Salmon recovery. Support the recovery and enhancement of salmon and steelhead stocks through the achievement of net ecological gain from planning under this chapter in accordance with rules adopted pursuant to this act in order to fulfill Washington's tribal treaty obligations, support nontribal commercial and recreational fisheries, and achieve the delisting and recovery of threatened or endangered salmon and steelhead runs under the federal endangered species act.**


## Section 5
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [36.70A](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

1. Through early and continuous consultation with each federally recognized Indian tribe with property, tribal reservation land, or usual and accustomed fishing areas in, adjacent to, or directly affected by the planning jurisdiction, and governments planning under RCW 36.70A.040, the department of fish and wildlife, with recommendations from the Washington state academy of sciences, shall adopt rules that establish criteria for net ecological gain and consistency with the applicable regional salmon recovery plans that counties and cities planning under RCW 36.70A.040 must meet through adoption of their comprehensive plans in order to support salmon recovery.

2. The rules adopted under this section must address the applicable components of salmon recovery plans that local governments have authority over, such as the habitat restoration and protection elements of the recovery plans.

3. The rules adopted under this section must ensure that, where appropriate, the interjurisdictional coordination process required by RCW 36.70A.100 addresses the issue of salmon recovery.

4. The rules adopted under this section must not require or assume that the proponents of individual private projects will be responsible for achieving net ecological gain. Rules adopted under this section must ensure that individual private projects achieve no net loss of ecological function, and that net ecological gain is achieved through the appropriate selection of publicly funded projects, and voluntary projects whose purpose is salmon recovery but which may receive funding from either public or private sources. Rules adopted under this section related to net ecological gain must account for the impact of the urban heat island effect on ecological function.

5. The department of fish and wildlife shall monitor progress towards the goals set forth in the regional salmon recovery plans. In addition, the department of fish and wildlife shall also monitor and report the progress that each jurisdiction planning under RCW 36.70A.040 has made toward achieving no net loss of ecological function and net ecological gain. As part of this ongoing monitoring effort, the department of fish and wildlife, in early and continuous consultation with the affected local governments and each federally recognized Indian tribe with property, tribal reservation land, or usual and accustomed fishing areas in, adjacent to, or directly affected by the planning jurisdiction, shall first establish the current environmental baseline conditions within each county and city planning under RCW 36.70A.040, develop targets, identify any monitoring data gaps and make recommendations to fill those gaps, and monitor the degree to which each jurisdiction is successful at achieving net ecological gains, and no net losses through individual projects, over time. The department of fish and wildlife is encouraged to work with or seek feedback from the local watershed groups in review of the current environmental baseline conditions, targets, and monitoring efforts.

6. The department of fish and wildlife shall provide a report of its monitoring under this section to the governor, the appropriate committees of the legislature, and the local governments subject to this act, no later than October 15th of every even-numbered year, beginning in 2022.

1. [Empty]

    a. Each county that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, and each city within such county, shall adopt development regulations on or before September 1, 1991, to assure the conservation of agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands designated under RCW 36.70A.170. Regulations adopted under this subsection may not prohibit uses legally existing on any parcel prior to their adoption and shall remain in effect until the county or city adopts development regulations pursuant to RCW 36.70A.040. Such regulations shall assure that the use of lands adjacent to agricultural, forest, or mineral resource lands shall not interfere with the continued use, in the accustomed manner and in accordance with best management practices, of these designated lands for the production of food, agricultural products, or timber, or for the extraction of minerals. Any county located to the west of the crest of the Cascade mountains that has both a population of at least four hundred thousand and a border that touches another state, and any city in such county, may adopt development regulations to assure that agriculture, forest, and mineral resource lands adjacent to short line railroads may be developed for freight rail dependent uses.

    b. Counties and cities shall require that all plats, short plats, development permits, and building permits issued for development activities on, or within five hundred feet of, lands designated as agricultural lands, forestlands, or mineral resource lands, contain a notice that the subject property is within or near designated agricultural lands, forestlands, or mineral resource lands on which a variety of commercial activities may occur that are not compatible with residential development for certain periods of limited duration. The notice for mineral resource lands shall also inform that an application might be made for mining-related activities, including mining, extraction, washing, crushing, stockpiling, blasting, transporting, and recycling of minerals.

    c. Each county that adopts a resolution of partial planning under RCW 36.70A.040(2)(b), and each city within such county, shall adopt development regulations within one year after the adoption of the resolution of partial planning to assure the conservation of agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands designated under RCW 36.70A.170. Regulations adopted under this subsection (1)(c) must comply with the requirements governing regulations adopted under (a) of this subsection.

    d. [Empty]

        i. A county that adopts a resolution of partial planning under RCW 36.70A.040(2)(b) and that is not in compliance with the planning requirements of this section, RCW 36.70A.040(4), 36.70A.070(5), 36.70A.170, and 36.70A.172 at the time the resolution is adopted must, by January 30, 2017, apply for a determination of compliance from the department finding that the county's development regulations, including development regulations adopted to protect critical areas, and comprehensive plans are in compliance with the requirements of this section, RCW 36.70A.040(4), 36.70A.070(5), 36.70A.170, and 36.70A.172. The department must approve or deny the application for a determination of compliance within one hundred twenty days of its receipt or by June 30, 2017, whichever date is earlier.

        ii. If the department denies an application under (d)(i) of this subsection, the county and each city within is obligated to comply with all requirements of this chapter and the resolution for partial planning adopted under RCW 36.70A.040(2)(b) is no longer in effect.

        iii. A petition for review of a determination of compliance under (d)(i) of this subsection may only be appealed to the growth management hearings board within sixty days of the issuance of the decision by the department.

        iv. In the event of a filing of a petition in accordance with (d)(iii) of this subsection, the county and the department must equally share the costs incurred by the department for defending an approval of determination of compliance that is before the growth management hearings board.

    v. The department may implement this subsection (1)(d) by adopting rules related to determinations of compliance. The rules may address, but are not limited to: The requirements for applications for a determination of compliance; charging of costs under (d)(iv) of this subsection; procedures for processing applications; criteria for the evaluation of applications; issuance and notice of department decisions; and applicable timelines.

    e. Any county that borders both the Cascade mountains and another country and has a population of less than fifty thousand people, and any city in such county, may adopt development regulations to assure that agriculture, forest, and mineral resource lands adjacent to short line railroads may be developed for freight rail dependent uses.

2. Each county and city shall adopt development regulations that protect critical areas that are required to be designated under RCW 36.70A.170. For counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040, such development regulations shall be adopted on or before September 1, 1991. For the remainder of the counties and cities, such development regulations shall be adopted on or before March 1, 1992. **Regulations that protect critical areas must apply the mitigation hierarchy requirement as defined in RCW 36.70A.030. Before utilizing a lower level in the mitigation hierarchy, project proponents must demonstrate that it is not possible to mitigate environmental impacts through actions taken consistent with higher levels of the mitigation hierarchy. When using compensatory mitigation, regulations must ensure that measures to mitigate by compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments result in no net loss of ecological function under a range of compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios, including compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios in which:**

    a. **The ecological functions and values provided by impacted elements of the environment are superior to the ecological functions and values provided by the mitigation measures; and**

    b. **Mitigation measures do not function as successfully as designed, intended, or expected.**

3. Such counties and cities shall review these designations and development regulations when adopting their comprehensive plans under RCW 36.70A.040 and implementing development regulations under RCW 36.70A.120 and may alter such designations and development regulations to insure consistency.

4. Forestland and agricultural land located within urban growth areas shall not be designated by a county or city as forestland or agricultural land of long-term commercial significance under RCW 36.70A.170 unless the city or county has enacted a program authorizing transfer or purchase of development rights.


## Section 7
> This section modifies existing section [90.74.020](/rcw/90_water_rights—environment/90.74_aquatic_resources_mitigation.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/90_water_rights—environment/90.74_aquatic_resources_mitigation.md) for context.

1. Project proponents may use a mitigation plan to propose compensatory mitigation within a watershed. A mitigation plan shall:

    a. Contain provisions that guarantee the long-term viability of the created, restored, enhanced, or preserved habitat, including assurances for protecting any essential biological functions and values defined in the mitigation plan;

    b. Contain provisions for long-term monitoring of any created, restored, or enhanced mitigation site;

    c. Be consistent with the local comprehensive land use plan and any other applicable planning process in effect for the development area, such as an adopted subbasin or watershed plan**; and**

    d. **Apply the mitigation hierarchy requirement as defined in RCW 36.70A.030. Before utilizing a lower level in the mitigation hierarchy, project proponents must demonstrate that it is not possible to mitigate environmental impacts through actions taken consistent with higher levels of the mitigation hierarchy. When using compensatory mitigation, a mitigation plan must ensure that measures to mitigate by compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments result in no net loss of ecological function under a range of compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios, including compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios in which:**

        i. **The ecological functions and values provided by impacted elements of the environment are superior to the ecological functions and values provided by the mitigation measures; and**

        ii. **Mitigation measures do not function as successfully as designed, intended, or expected**.

2. [Empty]

    a. The departments of ecology and fish and wildlife may not limit the scope of options in a mitigation plan to areas on or near the project site, or to habitat types of the same type as contained on the project site. The departments of ecology and fish and wildlife shall fully review and give due consideration to compensatory mitigation proposals that improve the overall biological functions and values of the watershed or bay and accommodate the mitigation needs of the infrastructure development or noninfrastructure development, including proposals or portions of proposals that are explored or developed in RCW 90.74.040.

    b. The departments of ecology and fish and wildlife are not required to grant approval to a mitigation plan that the departments find does not provide equal or better biological functions and values within the watershed or bay.

3. When making a permit or other regulatory decision under the guidance of this chapter, the departments of ecology and fish and wildlife shall consider whether the mitigation plan provides equal or better biological functions and values, compared to the existing conditions, for the target resources or species identified in the mitigation plan. This consideration shall be based upon the following factors:

    a. The relative value of the mitigation for the target resources, in terms of the quality and quantity of biological functions and values provided;

    b. The compatibility of the proposal with the intent of broader resource management and habitat management objectives and plans, such as existing resource management plans, watershed plans, critical areas ordinances, the forestry riparian easement program, the riparian open space program, the family forest fish passage program, and shoreline master programs;

    c. The ability of the mitigation to address scarce functions or values within a watershed;

    d. The benefits of the proposal to broader watershed landscape, including the benefits of connecting various habitat units or providing population-limiting habitats or functions for target species;

    e. The benefits of early implementation of habitat mitigation for projects that provide compensatory mitigation in advance of the project's planned impacts; and

    f. The significance of any negative impacts to nontarget species or resources.

4. A mitigation plan may be approved through a memorandum of agreement between the project proponent and either the department of ecology or the department of fish and wildlife, or both.


## Section 8
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [90.58](/rcw/90_water_rights—environment/90.58_shoreline_management_act_of_1971.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/90_water_rights—environment/90.58_shoreline_management_act_of_1971.md) for context.

Mitigation imposed under this chapter and consistent with chapter 43.21C RCW must apply the mitigation hierarchy requirement as defined in RCW 36.70A.030. Before utilizing a lower level in the mitigation hierarchy, project proponents must demonstrate that it is not possible to mitigate environmental impacts through actions taken consistent with higher levels of the mitigation hierarchy. When using compensatory mitigation, regulations must ensure that measures to mitigate by compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments result in no net loss of ecological function under a range of compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios, including compensatory mitigation implementation scenarios in which:

1. The ecological functions and values provided by impacted elements of the environment are superior to the ecological functions and values provided by the mitigation measures; and

2. Mitigation measures do not function as successfully as designed, intended, or expected.


## Section 9
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [36.70A](/rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.070A_growth_management—planning_by_selected_counties_and_cities.md) for context.

Nothing in this act is intended to reduce mitigation requirements under other applicable state and federal environmental laws.


## Section 10
Requirements to incorporate any changes to local government comprehensive plans or development regulations under this act become effective when funds sufficient to cover applicable local government costs are appropriated and distributed by the state at least two years before a local government must update comprehensive plans as required in RCW 36.70A.130.
