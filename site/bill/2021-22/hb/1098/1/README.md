    a. An experience rating account shall be established and maintained for each employer, except employers as described in RCW 50.44.010, 50.44.030, and 50.50.030 who have properly elected to make payments in lieu of contributions, taxable local government employers as described in RCW 50.44.035, and those employers who are required to make payments in lieu of contributions, based on existing records of the employment security department.

    b. Benefits paid to an eligible individual shall be charged to the experience rating accounts of each of such individual's employers during the individual's base year in the same ratio that the wages paid by each employer to the individual during the base year bear to the wages paid by all employers to that individual during that base year, except as otherwise provided in this section.

    c. When the eligible individual's separating employer is a covered contribution paying base year employer, benefits paid to the eligible individual shall be charged to the experience rating account of only the individual's separating employer if the individual qualifies for benefits under:

    a. A contribution paying base year employer, except employers as provided in subsection (5) of this section, not otherwise eligible for relief of charges for benefits under this section, may receive such relief if the benefit charges result from payment to an individual who:

        i. Last left the employ of such employer voluntarily for reasons not attributable to the employer;

        ii. Was discharged for misconduct or gross misconduct connected with his or her work not a result of inability to meet the minimum job requirements;

This closure must be for reasons directly attributable to a catastrophic occurrence such as fire, flood, or other natural disaster**, or to the presence of any dangerous, contagious, or infectious disease that is the subject of a public health emergency at the employer's plant, building, worksite, or other facility**;

        iv. Continues to be employed on a regularly scheduled permanent part-time basis by a base year employer and who at some time during the base year was concurrently employed and subsequently separated from at least one other base year employer. Benefit charge relief ceases when the employment relationship between the employer requesting relief and the claimant is terminated. This subsection does not apply to shared work employers under chapter 50.60 RCW;

    v. Continues to be employed on a regularly scheduled permanent part-time basis by a base year employer and who qualified for two consecutive unemployment claims where wages were attributable to at least one employer who employed the individual in both base years. Benefit charge relief ceases when the employment relationship between the employer requesting relief and the claimant is terminated. This subsection does not apply to shared work employers under chapter 50.60 RCW;

    vi. Was hired to replace an employee who is a member of the military reserves or National Guard and was called to federal active military service by the president of the United States and is subsequently laid off when that employee is reemployed by their employer upon release from active duty within the time provided for reemployment in RCW 73.16.035;

    vii. Worked for an employer for twenty weeks or less, and was laid off at the end of temporary employment when that employee temporarily replaced a permanent employee receiving family or medical leave benefits under Title 50A RCW, and the layoff is due to the return of that permanent employee. This subsection (3)(a)(vii) applies to claims with an effective date on or after January 1, 2020; or

    b. The employer requesting relief of charges under this subsection must request relief in writing within thirty days following mailing to the last known address of the notification of the valid initial determination of such claim, stating the date and reason for the separation or the circumstances of continued employment. The commissioner, upon investigation of the request, shall determine whether relief should be granted.

4. When a benefit claim becomes invalid due to an amendment or adjustment of a report where the employer failed to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, all benefits paid will be charged to the experience rating account of the contribution paying employer or employers that originally filed the incomplete or inaccurate report or reports. An employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefits paid to workers and who fails to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, shall reimburse the trust fund for all benefits paid that are based on the originally filed incomplete or inaccurate report or reports.

5. An employer's experience rating account may not be relieved of charges for a benefit payment and an employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefit payments may not be credited for a benefit payment if a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to the claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure and the employer or employer's agent has a pattern of such failures. The commissioner has the authority to determine whether the employer has good cause under this subsection.

    a. For the purposes of this subsection, "adequately" means providing accurate information of sufficient quantity and quality that would allow a reasonable person to determine eligibility for benefits.

    b. [Empty]

        i. For the purposes of this subsection, "pattern" means a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to a claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure, if the greater of the following calculations for an employer is met:

(A) At least three times in the previous two years; or

(B) Twenty percent of the total current claims against the employer.

        ii. If an employer's agent is utilized, a pattern is established based on each individual client employer that the employer's agent represents.


## Section 17
> This section modifies existing section [50.29.026](/rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.29_employer_experience_rating.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.29_employer_experience_rating.md) for context.

1. **Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section,** a qualified employer's contribution rate  or array calculation factor rate  determined under RCW 50.29.025 may be modified as follows:

    a. Subject to the limitations of this subsection, an employer may make a voluntary contribution of an amount equal to part or all of the benefits charged to the employer's account during the two years most recently ended on June 30th that were used for the purpose of computing the employer's contribution rate  or array calculation factor rate . On receiving timely payment of a voluntary contribution, plus a surcharge of ten percent of the amount of the voluntary contribution, the commissioner shall cancel the benefits equal to the amount of the voluntary contribution, excluding the surcharge, and compute a new benefit ratio for the employer. The employer shall then be assigned the contribution rate applicable for rate years beginning before January 1, 2005, or array calculation factor rate applicable for rate years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, applicable to the rate class within which the recomputed benefit ratio is included. The minimum amount of a voluntary contribution, excluding the surcharge, must be an amount that will result in a recomputed benefit ratio that is in a rate class at least four rate classes lower than the rate class that included the employer's original benefit ratio.

    b. Payment of a voluntary contribution is considered timely if received by the department during the period beginning on the date of mailing to the employer the notice of contribution rate  required under this title for the rate year for which the employer is seeking a modification of **the employer's** rate and ending on February 15th of that rate year .

    c. A benefit ratio may not be recomputed nor a rate be reduced under this section as a result of a voluntary contribution received after the payment period prescribed in (b) of this subsection.

2. **Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, this** section does not apply to any employer who has not had an increase of at least twelve rate classes from the previous tax rate year.

3. **From the effective date of this section and until May 31, 2026, the following applies:**

    a. **The surcharge in subsection (1)(a) of this section will not be charged or used in the calculations;**

    b. **The ending payment date in subsection (1)(b) of this section is March 31st;**

    c. **The minimum amount of a voluntary contribution must be an amount that will result in a recomputed benefit ratio that is in a rate class at least two rate classes lower than the rate class that included the employer's original benefit ratio; and**

    d. **This section does not apply to any employer who has not had an increase of at least eight rate classes from the previous tax rate year.**


## Section 18

1. For the rate year **beginning** 1985 **until rate year 2021**, a benefit ratio shall be computed for each qualified employer by dividing the total amount of benefits charged to the account of the employer during the forty-eight consecutive months immediately preceding the computation date by the taxable payrolls of the employer for the same forty-eight month period as reported to the department by the cut-off dates. The division shall be carried to the sixth decimal place with the remaining fraction, if any, disregarded.

2. **For the rate year 2022 and each rate year thereafter, a benefit ratio shall be computed for each qualified employer by dividing the total amount of benefits charged to the account of the employer during the 60 consecutive months immediately preceding the computation date by the taxable payrolls of the employer for the same 60-month period as reported to the department by the cut-off dates. The division shall be carried to the sixth decimal place with the remaining fraction, if any, disregarded.**


## Section 19
> This section modifies existing section [50.29.041](/rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.29_employer_experience_rating.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.29_employer_experience_rating.md) for context.

**Except for contributions assessed for rate years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025**, the contribution rate of each employer subject to contributions under RCW 50.24.010 shall include a solvency surcharge determined as follows:

1. This section shall apply to employers' contributions for a rate year immediately following a cut-off date only if, on the cut-off date, the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide fewer than seven months of unemployment benefits.

2. The solvency surcharge shall be the lowest rate necessary, as determined by the commissioner, but not more than two-tenths of one percent, to provide revenue during the applicable rate year that will fund unemployment benefits for the number of months that is the difference between nine months and the number of months for which the balance in the unemployment compensation fund on the cut-off date will provide benefits.

3. The basis for determining the number of months of unemployment benefits shall be the same basis used in RCW 50.29.025(1)(b)(i)(B).


## Section 20
> This section modifies existing section [50.29.062](/rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.29_employer_experience_rating.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.29_employer_experience_rating.md) for context.

1. If the department finds that a significant purpose of the transfer of the business is to obtain a reduced array calculation factor rate, contribution rates shall be computed and penalties and other sanctions shall apply as specified in RCW 50.29.063.

2. If subsection (1) of this section and RCW 50.29.063 do not apply and if the department finds that an employer is a successor, or partial successor, to a predecessor business, predecessor and successor employer contribution rates shall be computed in the following manner:

    a. If the successor is an employer, as defined in RCW 50.04.080, at the time of the transfer of a business, the following applies:

        i. The successor's contribution rate shall remain unchanged for the remainder of the rate year in which the transfer occurs.

        ii. Beginning January 1st following the transfer, the successor's contribution rate for each rate year shall be based on a combination of the following:

(A) The successor's experience with payrolls and benefits; and

(B) Any experience assigned to the predecessor involved in the transfer. If only a portion of the business was transferred, then the experience attributable to the acquired portion is assigned to the successor.

    b. If the successor is not an employer at the time of the transfer, the following applies:

        i.

Except as provided in (b)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection (2), the successor shall pay contributions:

(A) At the contribution rate assigned to the predecessor employer at the time of the transfer for the remainder of that rate year. Any experience attributable to the predecessor relating to the assignment of the predecessor's rate class is transferred to the successor.

(B) Beginning January 1st following the transfer, the successor's contribution rate for each rate year shall be based on an array calculation factor rate that is a combination of the following: The successor's experience with payrolls and benefits; and any experience assigned to the predecessor involved in the transfer. If only a portion of the business was transferred, then the experience attributable to the acquired portion is assigned to the successor if qualified under RCW 50.29.010 by including the transferred experience. If not qualified under RCW 50.29.010, the contribution rate shall equal the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025 (1)(d) and 50.29.041, if applicable, and continuing until the successor qualifies for a different rate, including the transferred experience.

        ii. If there is a substantial continuity of ownership, control, or management by the successor of the business of the predecessor, the successor shall pay contributions at the contribution rate determined for the predecessor employer at the time of the transfer for the remainder of that rate year. Any experience attributable to the predecessor relating to the assignment of the predecessor's rate class is transferred to the successor. Beginning January 1st following the transfer, the successor's array calculation factor rate shall be based on a combination of the transferred experience of the acquired business and the successor's experience after the transfer.

        iii. If the successor simultaneously acquires the business or a portion of the business of two or more employers with different contribution rates, the successor's rate, from the date the transfer occurred until the end of that rate year and until it qualifies in its own right for a new rate, shall be the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025 (1) (a) and (b)  and 50.29.041, applicable at the time of the acquisition, to the predecessor employer who, among the parties to the acquisition, had the largest total payroll in the completed calendar quarter immediately preceding the date of transfer, but not less than the sum of the rates determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025 (1)(d) and 50.29.041, if applicable.

    c. With respect to predecessor employers:

        i. The contribution rate on any payroll retained by a predecessor employer shall remain unchanged for the remainder of the rate year in which the transfer occurs.

        ii. In all cases, beginning January 1st following the transfer, the predecessor's contribution rate or the predecessor's array calculation factor for each rate year shall be based on its experience with payrolls and benefits as of the regular computation date for that rate year excluding the experience of the transferred business or transferred portion of business as that experience has transferred to the successor: PROVIDED, That if all of the predecessor's business is transferred to a successor or successors, the predecessor shall not be a qualified employer until it satisfies the requirements of a "qualified employer" as set forth in RCW 50.29.010.

3. A predecessor-successor relationship does not exist for purposes of subsection (2) of this section when a significant purpose of the transfer of a business or its operating assets is for the employer to move or expand an existing business, or for an employer to establish a substantially similar business under common ownership, management, and control. However, if an employer transfers its business to another employer, and both employers are at the time of transfer under substantially common ownership, management, or control, then the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred business shall also be transferred to, and combined with the unemployment experience attributable to, the employer to whom such business is so transferred as specified in subsection (2)(a) of this section.

4. For purposes of this section, "transfer of a business" means the same as RCW 50.29.063(4)(c).


## Section 21
> This section modifies existing section [50.29.063](/rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.29_employer_experience_rating.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.29_employer_experience_rating.md) for context.

1. If it is found that a significant purpose of the transfer of a business was to obtain a reduced array calculation factor rate, then the following applies:

    a. If the successor was an employer at the time of the transfer, then the experience rating accounts of the employers involved shall be combined into a single account and the employers assigned the higher of the predecessor or successor array calculation factor rate to take effect as of the date of the transfer.

    b. If the successor was not an employer at the time of the transfer, then the experience rating account of the acquired business must not be transferred and, instead, the sum of the rate determined by the commissioner under RCW 50.29.025 (1)(d) and 50.29.041, if applicable, shall be assigned.

2. If any part of a delinquency for which an assessment is made under this title is due to an intent to knowingly evade the successorship provisions of RCW 50.29.062 and this section, then with respect to the employer, and to any business found to be knowingly promoting the evasion of such provisions:

    a. The commissioner shall, for the rate year in which the commissioner makes the determination under this subsection and for each of the three consecutive rate years following that rate year, assign to the employer or business the total rate, which is the sum of the recalculated array calculation factor rate and a civil penalty assessment rate, calculated as follows:

        i. Recalculate the array calculation factor rate as the array calculation factor rate that should have applied to the employer or business under RCW 50.29.025 and 50.29.062; and

        ii. Calculate a civil penalty assessment rate in an amount that, when added to the array calculation factor rate determined under (a)(i) of this subsection for the applicable rate year, results in a total rate equal to the maximum array calculation factor rate under RCW 50.29.025 plus two percent, which total rate is not limited by any maximum array calculation factor rate established in RCW 50.29.025 (1)(b)(ii) ;

    b. The employer or business may be prosecuted under the penalties prescribed in RCW 50.36.020; and

    c. The employer or business must pay for the employment security department's reasonable expenses of auditing the employer's or business's books and collecting the civil penalty assessment.

3. If the person knowingly evading the successorship provisions, or knowingly attempting to evade these provisions, or knowingly promoting the evasion of these provisions, is not an employer, the person is subject to a civil penalty assessment of five thousand dollars per occurrence. In addition, the person is subject to the penalties prescribed in RCW 50.36.020 as if the person were an employer. The person must also pay for the employment security department's reasonable expenses of auditing his or her books and collecting the civil penalty assessment.

4. For purposes of this section:

    a. "Knowingly" means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for the prohibition involved and includes, but is not limited to, intent to evade, misrepresentation, or willful nondisclosure.

    b. "Person" means and includes an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation.

    c. "Transfer of a business" includes the transfer or acquisition of substantially all or a portion of the operating assets, which may include the employer's workforce.

5. Any decision to assess a penalty under this section shall be made by the chief administrative officer of the tax branch or his or her designee.

6. Nothing in this section shall be construed to deny an employer the right to appeal the assessment of a penalty in the manner provided in RCW 50.32.030.

7. The commissioner shall engage in prevention, detection, and collection activities related to evasion of the successorship provisions of RCW 50.29.062 and this section, and establish procedures to enforce this section.


## Section 22
> This section modifies existing section [50.44.060](/rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.44_special_coverage_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/50_unemployment_compensation/50.44_special_coverage_provisions.md) for context.

Benefits paid to employees of "nonprofit organizations" shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of this section. For the purpose of this section and RCW 50.44.070, the term "nonprofit organization" is limited to those organizations described in RCW 50.44.010, and joint accounts composed exclusively of such organizations.

1. Any nonprofit organization which is, or becomes subject to this title , shall pay contributions under the provisions of RCW 50.24.010 and chapter 50.29 RCW, unless it elects, in accordance with this subsection, to pay to the commissioner for the unemployment compensation fund an amount equal to the full amount of regular and additional benefits and one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid to individuals for weeks of unemployment that are based upon wages paid or payable during the effective period of such election to the extent that such payments are attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization.

    a. Any nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this title  may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than twelve months beginning with the date on which such subjectivity begins by filing a written notice of its election with the commissioner not later than thirty days immediately following the date of the determination of such subjectivity.

    b. Any nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with (a) of this subsection will continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions until it files with the commissioner a written notice terminating its election not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of the taxable year for which such termination shall first be effective.

    c. Any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this title  may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the commissioner not later than thirty days prior to the beginning of any taxable year a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions. Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next year.

    d. The commissioner may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election, or a notice of termination, must be filed and may permit an election to be retroactive .

    e. The commissioner, in accordance with such regulations as the commissioner may prescribe, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which the commissioner may make of its status as an employer and of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of such election. Any nonprofit organization subject to such determination and dissatisfied with such determination may file a request for review and redetermination with the commissioner within thirty days of the mailing of the determination to the organization. Should such request for review and redetermination be denied, the organization may, within ten days of the mailing of such notice of denial, file with the appeal tribunal a petition for hearing which shall be heard in the same manner as a petition for denial of refund. The appellate procedure prescribed by this title for further appeal shall apply to all denials of review and redetermination under this paragraph.

2. Payments in lieu of contributions shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this section including either (a) or (b) of this subsection.

    a. At the end of each calendar quarter, the commissioner shall bill each nonprofit organization or group of such organizations which has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions for an amount equal to the full amount of regular and additional benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid during such quarter that is attributable to service in the employ of such organization.

    b. [Empty]

        i. Each nonprofit organization that has elected payments in lieu of contributions may request permission to make such payments as provided in this paragraph. Such method of payment shall become effective upon approval by the commissioner.

        ii. At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of such other period as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall bill each nonprofit organization for an amount representing one of the following:

(A) The percentage of its total payroll for the immediately preceding calendar year as the commissioner shall determine. Such determination shall be based each year on the average benefit costs attributable to service in the employ of nonprofit organizations during the preceding calendar year.

(B) For any organization which did not pay wages throughout the four calendar quarters of the preceding calendar year, such percentage of its payroll during such year as the commissioner shall determine.

        iii. At the end of each taxable year, the commissioner may modify the quarterly percentage of payroll thereafter payable by the nonprofit organization in order to minimize excess or insufficient payments.

        iv. At the end of each taxable year, the commissioner shall determine whether the total of payments for such year made by a nonprofit organization is less than, or in excess of, the total amount of regular and additional benefits plus one-half of the amount of extended benefits paid to individuals during such taxable year based on wages attributable to service in the employ of such organization. Each nonprofit organization whose total payments for such year are less than the amount so determined shall be liable for payment of the unpaid balance to the fund in accordance with (c) of this subsection.
