I am suffering from  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ., which my attending **qualified medical provider** has determined is a terminal disease and which has been medically confirmed by a consulting **qualified medical provider**.

I have been fully informed of my diagnosis, prognosis, the nature of medication to be prescribed and potential associated risks, the expected result, and the feasible alternatives, including comfort care, hospice care, and pain control.

I request that my attending **qualified medical provider** prescribe medication that I may self-administer to end my life in a humane and dignified manner and to contact any pharmacist to fill the prescription.

INITIAL ONE:

. . . . . I have informed my family of my decision and taken their opinions into consideration.

. . . . . I have decided not to inform my family of my decision.

. . . . . I have no family to inform of my decision.

I understand that I have the right to rescind this request at any time.

I understand the full import of this request and I expect to die when I take the medication to be prescribed. I further understand that although most deaths occur within three hours, my death may take longer and my **qualified medical provider** has counseled me about this possibility.

I make this request voluntarily and without reservation, and I accept full moral responsibility for my actions.

Signed: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Dated: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
