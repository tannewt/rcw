1. In the year in which the district loses taxable value as a result of a court ruling, 25 percent of the value shall shift to the total levy;

2. In the year after the district loses taxable value as a result of a court ruling, 50 percent of the value shall shift to the total levy;

3. In the second year after the district loses taxable value as a result of a court ruling, 75 percent of the value shall shift to the total levy; and

4. In the third year after the district loses taxable value as a result of a court ruling, 100 percent of the value shall shift to the total levy.
