## Section 4
This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 1, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (section 1 of this act).

2. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to encourage the use of zero emission outdoor power equipment. It is the legislature's intent to support, through tax policy, reductions in greenhouse gas and conventional air pollutant emissions associated with outdoor power equipment usage.

3. To measure the effectiveness of this tax preference in achieving the specific public policy objective described in subsection (2) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must review, at minimum, and to the extent practicable and that such data is available:

    a. The amount of benefit to taxpayers in each county of the state as a result of the tax preference established in section 1 of this act; and

    b. The amount of tax preference applied to each type or category of zero emission outdoor power equipment.
