[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1477-S2.E.pdf)
## Section 101
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Nearly 6,000 Washington adults and children died by suicide in the last five years, according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention, tragically reflecting a state increase of 36 percent in the last 10 years.

    b. Suicide is now the single leading cause of death for Washington young people ages 10 through 24, with total deaths 22 percent higher than for vehicle crashes.

    c. Groups with suicide rates higher than the general population include veterans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, LGBTQ youth, and people living in rural counties across the state.

    d. More than one in five Washington residents are currently living with a behavioral health disorder.

    e. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased stressors and substance use among Washington residents.

    f. An improved crisis response system will reduce reliance on emergency room services and the use of law enforcement response to behavioral health crises and will stabilize individuals in the community whenever possible.

2. The legislature intends to establish crisis call center hubs and expand the crisis delivery system in a deliberate, phased approach that includes the involvement of partners from a range of perspectives to:

    a. Save lives by improving the quality of and access to behavioral health crisis services;

    b. Further equity in addressing mental health and substance use treatment and assure a culturally and linguistically competent response to behavioral health crises;

    c. Recognize that, historically, crisis response placed marginalized communities, including those experiencing behavioral health crises, at disproportionate risk of poor outcomes and criminal justice involvement;

    d. Comply with the national suicide hotline designation act of 2020 and the federal communication commission's rules adopted July 16, 2020, to assure that all Washington residents receive a consistent and effective level of 988 and crisis behavioral health services no matter where they live, work, or travel in the state; and

    e. Provide higher quality support for people experiencing behavioral health crises through investment in new technology to create a crisis call center hub system to triage calls and link individuals to follow-up care. Other investments include the expansion of crisis teams, to be known as mobile rapid response crisis teams, as well as a wide array of crisis stabilization services such as 23-hour crisis stabilization units based on the living room model, crisis stabilization centers, short-term respite facilities, peer-operated respite services, and behavioral health urgent care walk-in centers. The overall crisis system shall contain components that operate like hospital emergency departments that accept all walk-ins, and ambulance, fire, and police drop-offs. The use of peers must be incorporated as often as possible within the continuum of crisis care.


## Section 102
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [71.24](/rcw/71_mental_illness/71.24_community_behavioral_health_services_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/71_mental_illness/71.24_community_behavioral_health_services_act.md) for context.

1. Establishing the state crisis call center hubs and crisis response system will require collaborative work between the department and the authority within their respective roles. The department shall have primary responsibility for establishing and designating the crisis call centers hubs. The authority shall have primary responsibility for developing and implementing the crisis system and services to support the work of the crisis call center hubs. In any instance in which one agency is identified as the lead, the expectation is that agency will be communicating and collaborating with the other to ensure seamless, continuous, and effective service delivery with the statewide crisis system.

2. Prior to July 16, 2022, the department shall provide adequate funding for an expected increase in the use of the state's crisis lifeline call centers existing as of the effective date of this section using the 988 crisis hotline. The funding level shall be established at a level anticipated to achieve an in-state call response rate of at least 90 percent and shall be determined by considering call volume predictions, cost per call predictions provided by the national suicide prevention lifeline, guidance on center performance metrics, and necessary technology upgrades.

3. By July 1, 2023, the department must adopt rules to establish standards that crisis call centers must meet to be designated as crisis call center hubs by the department as of July 1, 2024. The standards must, at a minimum, address the elements identified in subsection (4) of this section. The department shall collaborate with the authority and other agencies to assure consistency in standards and policies, and utilization of services. The department shall consider recommendations from the crisis response improvement strategy committee created in section 104 of this act in implementing this section.

        ii. Access real-time information relevant to the appropriate coordination of behavioral health crisis services, including information about less restrictive alternatives and mental health advance directives, from managed care organizations, including both primary care providers and behavioral health providers within the networks of managed care organizations, behavioral health administrative service organizations, and other health care payers;

        iii. Assign and track local response to behavioral health crisis calls, including the capacity to rapidly deploy mobile crisis teams through global positioning technology;

        iv.

    v. Track and provide real-time bed availability to crisis responders and individuals in crisis for all behavioral health bed types, such as crisis stabilization, psychiatric inpatient, substance use disorder inpatient, withdrawal management, and peer crisis respite, including voluntary and involuntary beds; and

    vi. Assure follow-up services to individuals accessing the 988 crisis hotline consistent with policies established by the department based upon recognized best practices.

    c. Crisis call center hubs must use the new technologically advanced behavioral health crisis call center system with the platform as described in this section.

Meet the requirements set forth by the authority for serving high-risk and special populations, as identified by the federal substance abuse and mental health services administration, including training requirements and policies for transferring such callers to an appropriate specialized center or subnetwork within or external to the national suicide prevention lifeline network. Requirements for high-risk and special populations shall be established with the goal of promoting behavioral health equity for all populations specifically in regards to race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or geographic location. Appropriate referrals must provide linguistically and culturally competent care.

    f. Crisis call center hubs must work in collaboration with the authority and the national suicide prevention lifeline and veterans crisis line networks for the purpose of assuring consistency of public messaging about the 988 crisis hotline.

    g. The authority, in consultation with the department, must adopt rules as necessary to implement this section. The rules must allow appropriate information sharing and communication between and across crisis and emergency response systems for the purpose of real-time crisis care coordination including, but not limited to, deployment of crisis and outgoing services, follow-up care, and linked, flexible services specific to crisis response.

5. The department must collaborate with the state enhanced 911 coordination office, emergency management division, and military department to use technology that is demonstrated to be interoperable between the 988 crisis hotline system and crisis and emergency response systems used throughout the state, such as 911 systems, emergency medical services systems, and other nonbehavioral health crisis services, as well as the national suicide prevention lifeline, to assure cohesive interoperability, develop training programs and operations for both 911 public safety telecommunicators and crisis line workers, develop suicide assessment and intervention strategies, and establish efficient and equitable access to resources via crisis hotlines.
