## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [46.92](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.92_autonomous_motor_vehicles.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.92_autonomous_motor_vehicles.md) for context.

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Automated driving system" includes hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether it is limited to a specific operational design domain and regardless of the presence of a safety operator.

2. "Autonomous operation" means the performance of the entire dynamic driving task by an autonomous driving system, beginning upon performance of the entire dynamic driving task by an autonomous driving system and continuing until the autonomous driving system is disengaged.

3. "Autonomous vehicle" means a vehicle with a level 4 or level 5 automated driving system as provided in the society of automotive engineering international's standard J3016, as it existed on October 1, 2022, or such subsequent date as may be provided by the department by rule, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

4. "Autonomous vehicle testing entity" means a person conducting autonomous vehicle testing in the state.

5. "Dynamic driving task" means all of the real-time operational and tactical functions collectively required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic, including controlling lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion, monitoring the driving environment, executing responses to objects and events, planning vehicle maneuvers, and enhancing vehicle conspicuity. "Dynamic driving task" does not include the strategic functions of driving, such as scheduling trips, selecting destinations, and specifying routes.

6. "Minimal risk condition" means a condition to which a test operator or autonomous driving system brings a vehicle to reduce the risk of a collision when a trip cannot or should not be completed, such as bringing the vehicle to a complete stop.

7. "Operate" means the activities performed by a human operator or an autonomous driving system to perform the entire dynamic driving task for an autonomous vehicle.

8. "Operational design domain" means the environmental, geographic, time-of-day, traffic, infrastructure, and other conditions under which an autonomous driving system is specifically designed to function.

9. "Operator" means the autonomous driving system or natural person operating a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system.

10. "Testing" means the operation of an autonomous vehicle on public roadways to assess or demonstrate the autonomous vehicle's capabilities.
