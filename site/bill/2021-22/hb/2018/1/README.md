# House Bill 2018

## Section 1
The legislature recognizes that Washingtonians have been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused significant economic hardship for many. Along with rising costs of living across the state, the economic impacts of COVID-19 have put an additional strain on households already struggling to meet their basic needs. The legislature finds that Washington's tax system is the most regressive in the nation. Under Washington's regressive tax system, those who earn the least in the state pay a significantly higher percentage of their income in state and local retail sales tax, further increasing the economic burden on families.

The legislature finds that independent, local, main street businesses across the state have also been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While many big box stores with national and international resources were able to pivot to online sales or other strategies to weather the economic crisis, many main street businesses were unable to do the same and are now struggling.

Further, the legislature finds that the state's access to one-time funds should be used to benefit families and businesses throughout the state. Therefore, the legislature intends to create a one-time sales and use tax holiday for certain items, reducing the costs of goods for those families that need it most and spurring local economic activity.
