# House Bill 2003

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2003.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that Washington's statewide waste recovery rate, which seeks to preserve public health, safety, and welfare, and conserve energy and natural resources, has been on a declining trend since 2011 and that Washington is not on track to meet the statewide goal of 50 percent waste recovery established in 1989.

2. The legislature finds that packaging designs and materials have changed and the way Washington's residents use, consume, and manage materials when no longer wanted has also changed significantly in recent years. These shifts have created unintended consequences, such as the deterioration of natural systems regionally and worldwide, as well as increased levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change, and reductions in human well-being, especially for the most vulnerable populations.

3. The legislature finds that convenient and environmentally sound extended producer responsibility programs that include collecting, transporting, reusing, and recycling, or the proper end-of-life management of unwanted products help protect Washington's environment and the health of state residents. Unwanted products should be managed in a manner where a priority is placed on prevention, waste reduction, source reduction, reuse, and recycling over energy recovery and landfill disposal.

4. The legislature also finds that the department of ecology was directed, through an independent consultant, to study how plastic packaging is managed in the state, assess various policy options, and that the study recommendations included establishing an extended producer responsibility policy for all consumer packaging and paper products with a framework that makes producers responsible for achieving specific management and environmental outcomes for the packaging and paper products they supply into Washington state.

5. In addition, the legislature finds extended producer responsibility policies designed to cover all material types collected through the state's existing recycling system offers the potential for greater economies of scale and operational efficiencies than could be achieved under a policy applied only to a subset of materials collected through that system.

6. It is the intent of the legislature that extended producer responsibility programs, including targets, are implemented by and for producers of consumer packaging and paper products in a manner that involves producers from design concept to end-of-life management, and incentivizes innovation and research to minimize environmental impacts of the packaging and paper products.

7. It is also intended that these programs be responsibly managed, so that covered products are handled from the point of collection through the final destination in a way that benefits the environment and minimizes risks to public health and worker health and safety.

8. Finally, it is further the intent of the legislature that, through design and innovation, industry shall reduce the use of consumer packaging and paper products, increase the use of postconsumer recycled content and make all packaging reusable, recyclable, or compostable. The legislature intends that the policy of the state is to ensure that by 2040 an overall recycling and reuse rate of 90 percent is achieved for consumer packaging and paper products.

## Section 29
> This section modifies existing section [70A.205.005](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md) for context.

The legislature finds:

1. Continuing technological changes in methods of manufacture, packaging, and marketing of consumer products, together with the economic and population growth of this state, the rising affluence of its citizens, and its expanding industrial activity have created new and ever-mounting problems involving disposal of garbage, refuse, and solid waste materials resulting from domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities.

2. Traditional methods of disposing of solid wastes in this state are no longer adequate to meet the ever-increasing problem. Improper methods and practices of handling and disposal of solid wastes pollute our land, air and water resources, blight our countryside, adversely affect land values, and damage the overall quality of our environment.

3. Considerations of natural resource limitations, energy shortages, economics and the environment make necessary the development and implementation of solid waste recovery and/or recycling plans and programs.

4. Waste reduction must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. It is therefore necessary to change manufacturing and purchasing practices and waste generation behaviors to reduce the amount of waste that becomes a governmental responsibility.

5. Source separation of waste must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. Collection and handling strategies should have, as an ultimate goal, the source separation of all materials with resource value or environmental hazard.

6. [Empty]

    a. It should be the goal of every person and business to minimize their production of wastes and to separate recyclable or hazardous materials from mixed waste.

    b. It is the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to provide for a waste management infrastructure to fully implement waste reduction and source separation strategies and to process and dispose of remaining wastes in a manner that is environmentally safe and economically sound. It is further the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to monitor the cost-effectiveness and environmental safety of combusting separated waste, processing mixed municipal solid waste, and recycling programs.

    c. It is the responsibility of county and city governments to assume primary responsibility for solid waste management and to develop and implement aggressive and effective waste reduction and source separation strategies.

    d. It is the responsibility of state government to ensure that local governments are providing adequate source reduction and separation opportunities and incentives to all, including persons in both rural and urban areas, and nonresidential waste generators such as commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, recognizing the need to provide flexibility to accommodate differing population densities, distances to and availability of recycling markets, and collection and disposal costs in each community; and to provide county and city governments with adequate technical resources to accomplish this responsibility.

    e. **It is the responsibility of producers to provide for the responsible management of covered products, as those terms are defined in section 2 of this act.**

7. Environmental and economic considerations in solving the state's solid waste management problems requires strong consideration by local governments of regional solutions and intergovernmental cooperation.

8. The following priorities for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste are necessary and should be followed in descending order as applicable:

    a. Waste reduction;

    b. Recycling, with source separation of recyclable materials as the preferred method;

    c. Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of separated waste;

    d. Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of mixed municipal solid wastes.

9. It is the state's goal to achieve a fifty percent recycling rate by 2007.

10. It is the state's goal that programs be established to eliminate residential or commercial yard debris in landfills by 2012 in those areas where alternatives to disposal are readily available and effective.

11. Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal.

12. It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed.

13. Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued.

14. Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided.

15. Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste.

16. All governmental entities in the state should set an example by implementing aggressive waste reduction and recycling programs at their workplaces and by purchasing products that are made from recycled materials and are recyclable.

17. To ensure the safe and efficient operations of solid waste disposal facilities, it is necessary for operators and regulators of landfills and incinerators to receive training and certification.

18. It is necessary to provide adequate funding to all levels of government so that successful waste reduction and recycling programs can be implemented.

19. The development of stable and expanding markets for recyclable materials is critical to the long-term success of the state's recycling goals. Market development must be encouraged on a state, regional, and national basis to maximize its effectiveness. The state shall assume primary responsibility for the development of a multifaceted market development program to carry out the purposes of chapter 431, Laws of 1989.

20. There is an imperative need to anticipate, plan for, and accomplish effective storage, control, recovery, and recycling of discarded tires and other problem wastes with the subsequent conservation of resources and energy.


## Section 30
> This section modifies existing section [70A.205.010](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md) for context.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive statewide program for solid waste handling, and solid waste recovery and/or recycling which will prevent land, air, and water pollution and conserve the natural, economic, and energy resources of this state. To this end it is the purpose of this chapter:

1. To assign primary responsibility for adequate solid waste handling to local government, reserving to the state, however, those functions necessary to assure effective programs throughout the state**, and reserving to producers responsibility for the management of covered products under chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 39 of this act)**;

2. To provide for adequate planning for solid waste handling by local government;

3. To provide for the adoption and enforcement of basic minimum performance standards for solid waste handling, including that all sites where recyclable materials are generated and transported from shall provide a separate container for solid waste;

4. To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling, to promote consistency in the requirements for such facilities throughout the state, and to ensure that recyclable materials diverted from the waste stream for recycling are routed to facilities in which recycling occurs;

5. To provide technical and financial assistance to local governments in the planning, development, and conduct of solid waste handling programs;

6. To encourage storage, proper disposal, and recycling of discarded vehicle tires and to stimulate private recycling programs throughout the state; and

7. To encourage the development and operation of waste recycling facilities and activities needed to accomplish the management priority of waste recycling and to promote consistency in the permitting requirements for such facilities and activities throughout the state.

It is the intent of the legislature that local governments be encouraged to use the expertise of private industry and to contract with private industry to the fullest extent possible to carry out solid waste recovery and/or recycling programs.


## Section 31
> This section modifies existing section [70A.205.115](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.205_solid_waste_management—reduction_and_recycling.md) for context.

1.

The meetings shall include local private recycling businesses, private solid waste collection companies operating within the jurisdiction, and the local solid waste planning agencies. The meetings shall be held during the development of the waste reduction and recycling element or no later than one year prior to the date that a jurisdiction is required to submit the element under RCW 70A.205.075(2).

2. The meeting requirement under subsection (1) of this section shall apply whenever a city or county develops or amends the waste reduction and recycling element required under this chapter. Jurisdictions having approved waste reduction and recycling elements or having initiated a process for the selection of a service provider as of May 21, 1991, do not have to comply with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section until the next revisions to the waste reduction and recycling element are made or required.

3. After the waste reduction and recycling element is approved by the local legislative authority but before it is submitted to the department for approval, the local solid waste advisory committee shall hold at least one additional meeting to review the element.

4. For the purpose of this section, "private recycling business" means any private for-profit or private not-for-profit business that engages in the processing and marketing of recyclable materials.

5. **Beginning January 1, 2026, a jurisdiction shall, at a minimum, incorporate by reference the plans of producer responsibility organizations established in the jurisdiction under chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 39 of this act) to fulfill this requirement.**

## Section 34
> This section modifies existing section [81.77.030](/rcw/81_transportation/81.077_solid_waste_collection_companies.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/81_transportation/81.077_solid_waste_collection_companies.md) for context.

1. The commission shall supervise and regulate every solid waste collection company in this state

**:**

    a. By fixing and altering its rates, charges, classifications, rules and regulations;

    b. By regulating the accounts, service, and safety of operations;

    c. By requiring the filing of annual and other reports and data;

    f. **By reviewing producer responsibility organization reimbursement of regulated service providers and reviewing the financial information of private recycling businesses, consistent with section 13 of this act;**

    g. By requiring certificate holders under **this** chapter  to use rate structures and billing systems consistent with the solid waste management priorities set forth under RCW 70A.205.005 and the minimum levels of solid waste collection and recycling services pursuant to local comprehensive solid waste management plans **and with implementation of services designated by a producer responsibility organization in an approved plan to meet the requirements of chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 39 of this act)**. The commission may order consolidated billing and provide for reasonable and necessary expenses to be paid to the administering company if more than one certificate is granted in an area.

2. The commission, on complaint made on its own motion or by an aggrieved party, at any time, after providing the holder of any certificate with notice and an opportunity for a hearing at which it shall be proven that the holder has willfully violated or refused to observe any of the commission's orders, rules, or regulations, or has failed to operate as a solid waste collection company for a period of at least one year preceding the filing of the complaint, may suspend, revoke, alter, or amend any certificate issued under the provisions of this chapter.


## Section 35
> This section modifies existing section [81.77.040](/rcw/81_transportation/81.077_solid_waste_collection_companies.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/81_transportation/81.077_solid_waste_collection_companies.md) for context.

A solid waste collection company shall not operate for the hauling of solid waste for compensation without first having obtained from the commission a certificate declaring that public convenience and necessity require such operation. Operating for the hauling of solid waste for compensation includes advertising, soliciting, offering, or entering into an agreement to provide that service. To operate a solid waste collection company in the unincorporated areas of a county, the company must comply with the solid waste management plan prepared under chapter 70A.205 RCW in the company's franchise area **and, if applicable, the service standards established in an approved producer responsibility organization plan to meet the requirements of chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 39 of this act)**.

Issuance of the certificate of necessity must be determined on, but not limited to, the following factors: The present service and the cost thereof for the contemplated area to be served; an estimate of the cost of the facilities to be utilized in the plant for solid waste collection and disposal, set out in an affidavit or declaration; a statement of the assets on hand of the person, firm, association, or corporation that will be expended on the purported plant for solid waste collection and disposal, set out in an affidavit or declaration; a statement of prior experience, if any, in such field by the petitioner, set out in an affidavit or declaration; and sentiment in the community contemplated to be served as to the necessity for such a service.

When an applicant requests a certificate to operate in a territory already served by a certificate holder under this chapter, the commission may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, issue the certificate only if the existing solid waste collection company or companies serving the territory will not provide service to the satisfaction of the commission or if the existing solid waste collection company does not object.

In all other cases, the commission may, with or without hearing, issue certificates, or for good cause shown refuse to issue them, or issue them for the partial exercise only of the privilege sought, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted such terms and conditions as, in its judgment, the public convenience and necessity may require.

Any right, privilege, certificate held, owned, or obtained by a solid waste collection company may be sold, assigned, leased, transferred, or inherited as other property, only if authorized by the commission.

For purposes of issuing certificates under this chapter, the commission may adopt categories of solid wastes as follows: Garbage, refuse, recyclable materials, and demolition debris. A certificate may be issued for one or more categories of solid waste. Certificates issued on or before July 23, 1989, shall not be expanded or restricted by operation of this chapter.


## Section 36
> This section modifies existing section [81.77.160](/rcw/81_transportation/81.077_solid_waste_collection_companies.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/81_transportation/81.077_solid_waste_collection_companies.md) for context.

1. The commission, in fixing and altering collection rates charged by every solid waste collection company under this section, shall include in the base for the collection rates:

    a. All charges for the disposal of solid waste at the facility or facilities designated by a local jurisdiction under a local comprehensive solid waste management plan or ordinance; and

    b. All known and measurable costs related to implementation of the approved county or city comprehensive solid waste management plan **or to implementation of services designated by a producer responsibility organization in an approved plan to meet the requirements of chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 39 of this act)**.

2. If a solid waste collection company files a tariff to recover the costs specified under this section, and the commission suspends the tariff, the portion of the tariff covering costs specified in this section shall be placed in effect by the commission at the request of the company on an interim basis as of the originally filed effective date, subject to refund, pending the commission's final order. The commission may adopt rules to implement this section.

3. This section applies to a solid waste collection company that has an affiliated interest under chapter 81.16 RCW with a facility, if the total cost of disposal, including waste transfer, transport, and disposal charges, at the facility is equal to or lower than any other reasonable and currently available option.


## Section 37
> This section modifies existing section [81.77.185](/rcw/81_transportation/81.077_solid_waste_collection_companies.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/81_transportation/81.077_solid_waste_collection_companies.md) for context.

1. The commission shall allow solid waste collection companies collecting recyclable materials **other than covered products collected under an approved plan in chapter 70A.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 39 of this act)** to retain up to fifty percent of the revenue paid to the companies for the material if the companies submit a plan to the commission that is certified by the appropriate local government authority as being consistent with the local government solid waste plan and that demonstrates how the revenues will be used to increase recycling. The remaining revenue shall be passed to residential customers.

2. By December 2, 2005, the commission shall provide a report to the legislature that evaluates:

    a. The effectiveness of revenue sharing as an incentive to increase recycling in the state; and

    b. The effect of revenue sharing on costs to customers.


## Section 38
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
