# House Bill 2026

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2026.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that increasing the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles is helping to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, in the state. At the same time, the legislature also finds that a fair and equitable means of funding the statewide transportation system in the long-term is needed as vehicles become more fuel efficient. The legislature also finds that a road usage charge or per mile fee is a viable funding method that more fairly and accurately assesses road users for their use of public roads, rather than doing so through registration fees or motor vehicle fuel taxes. It is therefore the legislature's intent to establish a road usage charge program that imposes a per mile fee for the use of public roads.

The legislature further finds and declares that the road usage charge system must at all times protect individuals' privacy and civil liberties. Experience in states that collect road usage charges, in addition to the research and year-long test of road usage charging in Washington, demonstrates that mileage-based charges can be implemented in a manner that ensures data security and protects the privacy of vehicle owners. The legislature intends that the road usage charge system authorized in this act be designed and implemented in a manner that places privacy of the vehicle owner as a first principle, especially with regard to location data.
