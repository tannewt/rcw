# House Bill 1807

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1807.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature acknowledges that, as described in the state Constitution, it is the "paramount duty" of the state government to provide a uniform, high quality basic education to all kindergarten through high school students in the state, regardless of their location, background, or circumstance.

2. The legislature finds that a growing number of parents and families of Washington's kindergarten through high school students have become discouraged by the radical rhetoric of some state consultants who speak of their goals to "destabilize" and "tear down" the state's basic education system and curricula.

3. The legislature concludes that, in order to provide this uniform, high quality education, it needs to reassure the parents and families of Washington's kindergarten through high school students that the state's basic education system and curricula have not been torn apart but are still vibrant and designed for full academic discourse and discovery without mandated politicization in the classroom.

4. To that end, the legislature intends to clarify the state's goals in teaching its kindergarten through high school students about Washington's, and the United States', history, institutions, economy, population, and social structures. In short, these goals aim to provide all of Washington's children with a high quality civic education.
