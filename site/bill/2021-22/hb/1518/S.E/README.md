## Section 1
The legislature finds that there are environmental advantages to having state agencies purchase paper that is produced in a manner that reduces carbon dioxide to combat climate change.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [43.19A.022](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.019A_recycled_product_procurement.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.019A_recycled_product_procurement.md) for context.

1. All state agencies shall purchase**, for use in office printers and copiers, (a)** one hundred percent **postconsumer** recycled content white cut sheet bond paper **or (b) paper that has at least 30 percent recycled content and is certified as responsibly sourced by a third-party certification entity approved by the department of enterprise services under subsection (4) of this section**. State agencies are encouraged to give priority to purchasing from companies that produce paper in facilities that generate energy from a renewable energy source.

2. State agencies that utilize office printers and copiers that, after reasonable attempts, cannot be calibrated to utilize such paper referenced in subsection (1) of this section, must for those models of equipment:

    a. Purchase paper at the highest recycled content that can be utilized efficiently by the copier or printer;

    b. At the time of lease renewal or at the end of the life cycle, either lease or purchase a model that will efficiently utilize **paper that complies with subsection (1) of this section**.

3. Printed projects that require the use of high volume production inserters or high-speed digital devices, such as those used by the department of enterprise services, are not required to meet the one hundred percent recycled content white cut sheet bond paper standard, but must **still comply with subsection (1)(b) of this section**.

4. The department of enterprise services shall identify for use by agencies  paper products that **comply with subsection (1) of this section, and** process efficiently through high-speed production equipment and do not impede the business of agencies. **The department shall also identify, and approve, organizations that can certify paper as responsibly sourced.**
