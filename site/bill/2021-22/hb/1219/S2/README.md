# Second Substitute House Bill 1219 as Recommended by Appropriations

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1219-S2.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature recognizes that dependency proceedings determine many critical aspects of a child's future, including whether the child may remain at home with their family, whether and how often the child sees their parents and siblings if they do not remain with their family, where the child attends school, and how long the child remains in state care. Children and youth, regardless of age, have many legal rights at stake in these proceedings, including a right to maintain family relationships, a right to freedom from harm, and a right to reasonable safety. Standards-based representation by a well-qualified attorney can be invaluable in protecting and advancing the child's legal rights and, where articulable, stated interests. Attorneys can advise and assist children and youth in presenting their experiences and position to the court, improving the court's comprehensive decision making.

2. The legislature further recognizes that appointing attorneys to provide standards-based legal representation for children and youth in dependency proceedings has been shown to result in more timely permanency for children and youth, increased school and placement stability, and increased contact with parents and siblings.

3. The legislature finds that the current system for child legal representation is inadequate and has resulted in a patchwork system that varies by county leading to many children and youth not having equal access to the court process. This is particularly true when significant events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, result in sudden changes to court rules and procedures.

4. The legislature further finds that Black and Indigenous children and youth and other youth of color are much more likely to be removed from their parents' care, placed into foster care, and remain in the child welfare system longer than White children. Systemic racism contributes to this overrepresentation and to the lack of meaningful access to the court process for children and their families. It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that any expansion of legal representation actively combat this disproportionality.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [13.34.090](/rcw/13_juvenile_courts_and_juvenile_offenders/13.34_juvenile_court_act—dependency_and_termination_of_parent-child_relationship.md).

2. At all stages of a proceeding in which a child is alleged to be dependent, the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian has the right to be represented by counsel, and if indigent, to have counsel appointed for him or her by the court.

Copies of department  records to which **the child and the child's** parents have legal access pursuant to chapter 13.50 RCW shall be given to the **child or child's counsel, and the parents**, guardian, legal custodian, or his or her legal counsel, prior to any shelter care hearing and within **15** days after the department  receives a written request for such records from the **child or child's counsel, and the parents**, guardian, legal custodian, or his or her legal counsel. These records shall be provided to the child's parents, guardian, legal custodian, or legal counsel a reasonable period of time prior to the shelter care hearing in order to allow an opportunity to review the records prior to the hearing. These records shall be legible and shall be provided at no expense to the **child or child's counsel, and the** parents, guardian, legal custodian, or his or her counsel. When the records are served on legal counsel, legal counsel shall have the opportunity to review the records with the **client** and shall review the records with the **client** prior to the shelter care hearing.

At the commencement of the shelter care hearing the court shall advise the parties of basic rights as provided in RCW 13.34.090 and appoint counsel **to the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian** pursuant to RCW 13.34.090 if the parent **,** guardian**, or legal custodian** is indigent unless counsel has been retained by the parent **,** guardian**, or legal custodian** or the court finds that the right to counsel has been expressly and voluntarily waived in court.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [13.34.100](/rcw/13_juvenile_courts_and_juvenile_offenders/13.34_juvenile_court_act—dependency_and_termination_of_parent-child_relationship.md).

1. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for a child who is the subject of an action under this chapter, unless a court for good cause finds the appointment unnecessary. The requirement of a guardian ad litem may be deemed satisfied if the child is represented by an independent attorney in the proceedings. The court shall attempt to match a child with special needs with a guardian ad litem who has specific training or education related to the child's individual needs.

2. If the court does not have available to it a guardian ad litem program with a sufficient number of volunteers, the court may appoint a suitable person to act as guardian ad litem for the child under this chapter. Another party to the proceeding or the party's employee or representative shall not be so appointed.

    a. Level of formal education;

    b. General training related to the guardian ad litem's duties;

    c. Specific training related to issues potentially faced by children in the dependency system;

    h. Founded allegations of abuse or neglect as defined in RCW 26.44.020;

    i. The results of an examination of state and national criminal identification data. The examination shall consist of a background check as allowed through the Washington state criminal records privacy act under RCW 10.97.050, the Washington state patrol criminal identification system under RCW 43.43.832 through 43.43.834, and the federal bureau of investigation. The background check shall be done through the Washington state patrol criminal identification section and must include a national check from the federal bureau of investigation based on the submission of fingerprints; and

    j. Criminal history, as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, for the period covering **10** years prior to the appointment.

The background information record shall be updated annually and fingerprint-based background checks shall be updated every three years. As a condition of appointment, the guardian ad litem's background information record shall be made available to the court. If the appointed guardian ad litem is not a member of a guardian ad litem program a suitable person appointed by the court to act as guardian ad litem shall provide the background information record to the court.

Upon appointment, the guardian ad litem, or guardian ad litem program, shall provide the parties or their attorneys with a copy of the background information record. The portion of the background information record containing the results of the criminal background check and the criminal history shall not be disclosed to the parties or their attorneys. The background information record shall not include identifying information that may be used to harm a guardian ad litem, such as home addresses and home telephone numbers, and for volunteer guardians ad litem the court may allow the use of maiden names or pseudonyms as necessary for their safety.

4. The appointment of the guardian ad litem shall remain in effect until the court discharges the appointment or no longer has jurisdiction, whichever comes first. The guardian ad litem may also be discharged upon entry of an order of guardianship.

5. A guardian ad litem through an attorney, or as otherwise authorized by the court, shall have the right to present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and to be present at all hearings. A guardian ad litem shall receive copies of all pleadings and other documents filed or submitted to the court, and notice of all hearings according to court rules. The guardian ad litem shall receive all notice contemplated for a parent or other party in all proceedings under this chapter.

6.

For the purposes of child abuse prevention and treatment act (42 U.S.C. Secs. 5101 et seq.) grants to this state under P.L. 93-247, or any related state or federal legislation, a person appointed pursuant to this section shall be deemed a guardian ad litem.

7. When a court-appointed special advocate or volunteer guardian ad litem is requested on a case, the program shall give the court the name of the person it recommends. The program shall attempt to match a child with special needs with a guardian ad litem who has specific training or education related to the child's individual needs. The court shall immediately appoint the person recommended by the program.

8. If a party in a case reasonably believes the court-appointed special advocate or volunteer guardian ad litem is inappropriate or unqualified, the party may request a review of the appointment by the program. The program must complete the review within five judicial days and remove any appointee for good cause. If the party seeking the review is not satisfied with the outcome of the review, the party may file a motion with the court for the removal of the court-appointed special advocate or volunteer guardian ad litem on the grounds the advocate or volunteer is inappropriate or unqualified.

9. The court shall remove any person from serving as a court-appointed special advocate or volunteer guardian ad litem if the court is notified that the person has been removed from another county's registry pursuant to the disposition of a grievance or if the court is otherwise made aware that the individual was found by a court to have made a materially false statement that he or she knows to be false during an official proceeding under oath.

Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/13_juvenile_courts_and_juvenile_offenders/13.34_juvenile_court_act—dependency_and_termination_of_parent-child_relationship.md) for context.

1. The Washington state center for court research shall convene stakeholders, including youth and young adults, to identify the relevant outcome measures and data collection methods that appropriately protect attorney-client privilege to effectively assess:

## Section 9
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [2.53](/rcw/02_courts_of_record/2.53_civil_legal_aid.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/02_courts_of_record/2.53_civil_legal_aid.md) for context.

1. The legislature recognizes that substantial changes have occurred that inform the best practices related to representation of children and youth in dependency cases, including new understandings relating to equity, disproportionality, cultural competency, and trauma-informed representation. The legislature further recognizes the role that training, supportive supervision, and competitive compensation structures play in recruiting and retaining a diverse pool of well-qualified attorneys. The legislature further recognizes that standards-based representation continues to be necessary to ensure effective representation of the stated and legal interests of children and youth involved in the child welfare system.

2. The legislature therefore respectfully requests that the supreme court's commission on children in foster care convene a children's representation work group composed of relevant stakeholders, including an independent expert in attorneys' ethical duties, to review and update, where appropriate, the standards of practice, caseload limits, and training guidelines, referenced in RCW 2.53.045 and section 6 of this act. The updated standards shall be developed by December 31, 2021.

3. In addition, the work group is requested to review, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, the available research and best practices regarding representation of the legal interests of children under the age of eight, and submit to the legislature recommendations regarding the appropriate model of representation, including timing of appointment, training and oversight needs, and other considerations. The recommendations shall be reported to the relevant committees of the legislature by December 31, 2021.

4. This section expires July 1, 2022.


## Section 10
> This section modifies existing section [13.34.267](/rcw/13_juvenile_courts_and_juvenile_offenders/13.34_juvenile_court_act—dependency_and_termination_of_parent-child_relationship.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/13_juvenile_courts_and_juvenile_offenders/13.34_juvenile_court_act—dependency_and_termination_of_parent-child_relationship.md) for context.

1. In order to facilitate the delivery of extended foster care services, the court, upon the agreement of the youth to participate in the extended foster care program, shall maintain the dependency proceeding for any youth who is dependent at the age of eighteen years and who, at the time of his or her eighteenth birthday, is:

    a. Enrolled in a secondary education program or a secondary education equivalency program;

    b. Enrolled and participating in a postsecondary academic or postsecondary vocational program, or has applied for and can demonstrate that he or she intends to timely enroll in a postsecondary academic or postsecondary vocational program;

    c. Participating in a program or activity designed to promote employment or remove barriers to employment;

    d. Engaged in employment for eighty hours or more per month; or

    e. Not able to engage in any of the activities described in (a) through (d) of this subsection due to a documented medical condition.

2. If the court maintains the dependency proceeding of a youth pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the youth is eligible to receive extended foster care services pursuant to RCW 74.13.031, subject to the youth's continuing eligibility and agreement to participate.

3. A dependent youth receiving extended foster care services is a party to the dependency proceeding. The youth's parent or guardian must be dismissed from the dependency proceeding when the youth reaches the age of eighteen.

4. The court shall dismiss the dependency proceeding for any youth who is a dependent and who, at the age of eighteen years, does not meet any of the criteria described in subsection (1)(a) through (e) of this section or does not agree to participate in the program.

5. The court shall order a youth participating in extended foster care services to be under the placement and care authority of the department, subject to the youth's continuing agreement to participate in extended foster care services. The department may establish foster care rates appropriate to the needs of the youth participating in extended foster care services. The department's placement and care authority over a youth receiving extended foster care services is solely for the purpose of providing services and does not create a legal responsibility for the actions of the youth receiving extended foster care services.

6. [Empty]

    a. The court shall appoint counsel to represent a youth, as defined in RCW 13.34.030(2)(b), in dependency proceedings under this section. **Subject to amounts appropriated, the state shall pay the costs of legal services provided by an attorney appointed pursuant to this subsection based on the phase-in schedule outlined in section 6 of this act, provided that the legal services are provided in accordance with the rules of professional conduct, the standards of practice, caseload limits, and training guidelines adopted by the children's representation work group established in section 9 of this act.**

    b. **Continuity of counsel shall be prioritized for children who are already represented at county expense when the statewide children's legal representation program becomes effective in a county. The statewide children's legal representation program shall coordinate with relevant county stakeholders to determine how best to prioritize continuity of counsel.**

7. The case plan for and delivery of services to a youth receiving extended foster care services is subject to the review requirements set forth in RCW 13.34.138 and 13.34.145, and should be applied in a developmentally appropriate manner, as they relate to youth age eighteen to twenty-one years. Additionally, the court shall consider:

    a. Whether the youth is safe in his or her placement;

    b. Whether the youth continues to be eligible for extended foster care services;

    c. Whether the current placement is developmentally appropriate for the youth;

    d. The youth's development of independent living skills; and

    e. The youth's overall progress toward transitioning to full independence and the projected date for achieving such transition.

8. Prior to the review hearing, the youth's attorney shall indicate whether there are any contested issues and may provide additional information necessary for the court's review.


## Section 11
If specific funding for the purposes of this act, referencing this act by bill or chapter number, is not provided by June 30, 2021, in the omnibus appropriations act, this act is null and void.
