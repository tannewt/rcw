# Second Substitute House Bill 2044 as Recommended by Appropriations

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2044-S2.pdf)
## Section 1
Washington state branches of government, agencies, boards, and commissions manage and protect highly sensitive data in order to best serve constituents. The data managed by public entities is a high value target for domestic and international perpetrators of for-profit ransomware and other malicious cyber activities. Breaches in data security prevent state agencies from protecting confidential and sensitive information stored in technology systems. In the absence of immutable data backup capabilities and reliable disaster recovery practices, state agency information technology systems are vulnerable to such breaches in security. The legislature finds that enterprise technology programs, standards, and policies have been developed for data backup and recovery practices that agencies must implement to protect confidential and sensitive information contained in enterprise and individual agencies' information technology systems. The legislature further finds that the availability of an enterprise identity management solution, the active promotion of cybersecurity awareness practices, readiness of state resources for incident management, and the availability of immutable data backups of critical, sensitive, and confidential data are the best protection that the state can offer to combat ransomware and other malicious cyber activities. The legislature recognizes that action must be taken at each state agency to ensure data backup and disaster recovery practices are consistent with enterprise technology standards and is aware that additional investments in technology, training, and personnel will be needed.


## Section 2
