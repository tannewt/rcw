    a. The department is authorized to issue grants to eligible public entities to reduce current or future hardship caused by water unavailability stemming from drought conditions. No single entity may receive more than **25** percent of the total funds available. The department is not obligated to fund projects that do not provide sufficient benefit to alleviating hardship caused by drought or water unavailability. Projects must show substantial benefit from securing water supply, availability, or reliability relative to project costs. **Projects do not need to be completed while a drought emergency order under RCW 43.83B.405(2) is in effect.**

    b. Except for projects for public water systems serving economically disadvantaged communities, the department may only fund up to **50** percent of the total eligible cost of the project. Money used by applicants as a cash match may not originate from other state funds.

    c. For the purposes of this chapter, eligible public entities include only:

        i. Counties, cities, and towns;

2. Grants may be used to develop projects that enhance the ability of water users to effectively mitigate for the impacts of water unavailability arising from drought. Project applicants must demonstrate that the projects will increase their resiliency, preparedness, or ability to withstand drought conditions when they occur. Projects may include, but are not limited to:

    a. Creation of additional water storage;

    b. Implementation of source substitution projects;

    c. Development of alternative, backup, or emergency water supplies or interties;

    d. Installation of infrastructure or creation of educational programs that improve water conservation and efficiency or promote use of reclaimed water;

The state drought preparedness  account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from appropriated funds designated for the account and all cost recovery revenues collected under RCW 43.83B.410(5) must be deposited into the account. **At the beginning of each biennium the state treasurer shall transfer into the account from the general fund the sum of $2,000,000.** Expenditures from the account may be used for drought **planning and** preparedness  activities under this chapter, including grants issued under RCW 43.83B.415.

Upon the issuance of an order of drought emergency under RCW 43.83B.405(2), the state treasurer shall transfer from the general fund to the emergency drought response account created in section 4 of this act such amounts as necessary to bring the balance of the account to $3,000,000. The office of financial management must determine the fund balance of the emergency drought response account as of the previous fiscal month before the issuance of an order of drought emergency. The office of financial management must promptly notify the state treasurer and the department of the account balance and the necessary transfer amount once a determination is made. A transfer based on the determination by the office of financial management may be made only once every fiscal year. The department shall, at a minimum, provide the director of the office of financial management, legislative fiscal committees, and the joint legislative committee on water supply during drought, established under RCW 90.86.010, with a close-out cost summary following the expiration of the emergency drought order.
