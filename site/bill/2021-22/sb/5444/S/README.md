# Substitute Senate Bill 5444 as Recommended by Transportation

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5444-S.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that increasing the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles is helping to reduce harmful air pollution from exhaust emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, in the state. At the same time, the legislature also finds that there is a need to ensure that the greater adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles does not reduce funds to maintain and improve transportation infrastructure and that there is a need for fairness in how these funds are generated. The legislature also finds that a road usage charge or per mile fee system appears to be a viable method to ensure these goals are achieved. It is therefore the legislature's intent to impose a per mile fee to mitigate the impact of increased electric and hybrid vehicles on state roads and highways and to allow further evaluation of the feasibility of transitioning from a revenue collection system based on fuel taxes to a per mile funding system.

The legislature further finds and declares that the per mile funding system must at all times recognize and respect an individual's interests in privacy, information use, and civil liberties. Experience in states that collect road usage charges, as well as the research and year-long test of road usage charging in Washington, demonstrates that mileage-based charges can be implemented in a way that ensures data security and protects the privacy of vehicle owners. The legislature intends that the per mile funding system authorized in this act be designed and implemented in a manner that places privacy of the vehicle owner as a first principle, especially with regard to location data. Detailed travel locations or patterns must not be disclosed, and legal and technical safeguards must protect personal information.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [46.17](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.17_vehicle_fees.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.17_vehicle_fees.md) for context.

1. By December 1, 2023, the department and the transportation commission must collaborate to develop an implementation plan for the voluntary early adoption program pursuant to subsection (3) of this section and imposing a per mile fee on electric and hybrid vehicles pursuant to subsection (2) of this section with the goal of creating a more dynamic and equitable funding system that could potentially incorporate additional policy priorities than the current transportation funding system. This plan must incorporate the ongoing work of the transportation commission in evaluating a road usage charge, including coordinating with federal grant-funded research and development to continue in parallel with these activities. The plan must include, but is not limited to:

    a. Different mileage reporting methods;

    b. Recommended payment collection means and rates for achieving cost efficiency, fairness, minimal administrative cost, payment compliance, consumer choice, and preserving individual privacy;

    c. Adjustments or modifications to ensure that the existing funding for local government support and transportation infrastructure investments are maintained and not reduced as a result of the fee reductions in this act;

    d. Options for differential or additional rates based on the particular classifications of vehicles, to ensure vehicles are paying for their proportional impact on road preservation and maintenance costs, legislative environmental policies, or other policy levers that the legislature may want to consider;

    e. Options for collaborating with other states or countries in the development and administration of the per mile funding system;

    f. Evaluation and comparison of the benefits and costs of allowing for payment plan options and annual payment;

    g. Any recommended statutory changes, including suggested offsets or rebates to the per mile fees. These offsets or rebates will not be utilized in the per mile funding system until approved by the legislature;

    h. Specific recommendations to better align the system with other vehicle-related charges and potentially establish the framework for broader implementation of a per mile funding system, including analysis of the preferred method for addressing eighteenth amendment restriction considerations;

    i. A recommended implementation and governance structure, and transition plan with the department as the designated lead agency to operate and administer the per mile funding system;

    j. A recommendation on the best agency to be lead for public outreach and education;

    k. Recommendations for augmenting vehicle owner privacy in light of new and emerging mileage reporting methods or technologies, and proposed rules to be adopted by the commission related to extend privacy protections in a per mile funding system; and

    l. Detailed information on the recommended periodic review and evaluation process to best ensure the per mile funding system is achieving the policy and revenue goals established by the legislature.

    b. Except as otherwise specified in this subsection (3), participants in the voluntary early adoption program must pay two cents per mile driven in addition to all other fees and taxes required by law.

    c. For active participants in the voluntary early adoption program, the department must waive payment of the electric vehicle registration renewal fees as specified in RCW 46.17.323 and the transportation electrification fee as specified in RCW 46.17.324(1).

    d. Besides the vehicles specified in (a) of this subsection, the voluntary early adoption program must include participation of at least five hundred electric, hybrid, and internal combustion state-owned passenger or light duty truck fleet vehicles. These vehicles are not subject to the per mile fee specified in (b) of this subsection. The department, in consultation with the transportation commission, shall establish the types of state fleet vehicles for participation to further test the viability of a per mile fee on the full range of vehicles that may be subject to a per mile fee in future years. The voluntary early adoption program as it specifically relates to state-owned fleet vehicles may be initiated as early as December 1, 2024, based on the technical capability of the department to implement the program for these vehicles.

    e. By July 1, 2024, after consultation with the transportation commission on lessons learned from Washington's road usage charge pilot and research, the department must adopt rules to implement the voluntary early adoption program specified in this subsection (3), which must include procedures for recoupment of any waived fees if the participant is not actively participating in the voluntary early adoption program.

4. This section only applies to a vehicle that is designed to have the capability to drive at a speed of more than 35 miles per hour and has a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less.

5. Proceeds from the per mile fee imposed under this section must be used for preservation and maintenance and must be deposited in the motor vehicle fund created in RCW 46.68.070.
