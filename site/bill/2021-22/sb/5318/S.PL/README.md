## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [15.54.275](/rcw/15_agriculture_and_marketing/15.054_fertilizers_minerals_and_limes.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/15_agriculture_and_marketing/15.054_fertilizers_minerals_and_limes.md) for context.

1. No person may distribute a bulk fertilizer in this state until a license to distribute has been obtained by that person. An annual license is required for each out-of-state or in-state location that distributes bulk fertilizer in Washington state. An application for each location must be filed on forms provided by the business licensing system established under chapter 19.02 RCW and must be accompanied by an annual fee of **fifty** dollars per location. The license expires on the business license expiration date.

2. An application for license must include the following:

    a. The name and address of licensee.

    b. Any other information required by the department by rule.

3. The name and address shown on the license must be shown on all labels, pertinent invoices, and storage facilities for fertilizer distributed by the licensee in this state.

4. If an application for license renewal provided for in this section is not filed prior to the business license expiration date, a delinquency fee of **fifty** dollars must be assessed and added to the original fee and must be paid by the applicant before the renewal license is issued. The assessment of this delinquency fee does not prevent the department from taking any other action as provided for in this chapter.

2. An application for registration must be made on a form furnished by the department and must include the following:

    a. The product name;

The provisions of (g)(i) of this subsection do not apply if the anhydrous ammonia is derived in whole or in part from waste such that the fertilizer is a "waste-derived fertilizer" as defined in RCW 15.54.270. Verification of a registration relied on by an applicant under (g)(iii) of this subsection must be submitted with the application;

    h. If a waste-derived fertilizer or micronutrient fertilizer, information to ensure the product complies with chapter 70A.300 RCW and the resource conservation and recovery act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 6901 et seq.; and

3. All companies planning to mix customer-formula fertilizers shall include the statement "customer-formula grade mixes" under the column headed "product name" on the product registration application form. All customer-formula fertilizers sold under one brand name shall be considered one product.

4. Registrations are issued by the department for a two-year period beginning on July 1st of a given year and ending twenty-four months later on July 1st, except that registrations issued to a registrant who applies to register an additional product during the last twelve months of the registrant's period expire on the next July 1st.

If an application for renewal is not received by the department by the due date, a late fee of **fifty** dollars per product is added to the original fee and must be paid by the applicant before the renewal registration may be issued.  Payment of a late fee does not prevent the department from taking any action authorized by this chapter for the violation.

7. It is a misdemeanor for any person to divulge any information provided under this section that would reveal the business operation of the person making the report. However, nothing contained in this subsection may be construed to prevent or make unlawful the use of information concerning the business operations of a person in any action, suit, or proceeding instituted under the authority of this chapter, including any civil action for the collection of unpaid inspection fees, which action is authorized and which shall be as an action at law in the name of the director of the department.

8. **Payment of late fees or filing fees provided for under this section does not prevent the department from taking any other action authorized by this chapter for the violation.**
