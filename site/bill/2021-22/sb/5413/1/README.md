# Senate Bill 5413

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5413.pdf)
## Section 1
This act may be known and cited as the "Solitary Confinement Restriction Act."


## Section 2
The Legislature finds and declares that:

1. The use of solitary confinement in Washington state's correctional facilities should be restricted to ensure the safe and humane operation of these facilities, consistent with the state and federal Constitution, the laws and public policies of this state, the mission of the correctional system, evolving medical knowledge, and the human rights standards of decency.

2. Solitary confinement should only be used when necessary, and should not be used against vulnerable populations or under conditions or for time periods that foster psychological trauma, psychiatric disorders, or serious, long-term damage to a person's brain.

3. The standards established in this act should apply to all incarcerated persons in the custody of the department of corrections.

4. In 2020, the Washington state attorney general's office proposed legislation to ban the use of solitary confinement for juveniles; the bill passed with bipartisan support.

5. More than 800 adults continue to be held in solitary confinement in Washington's prisons; solitary confinement is disproportionately imposed upon Black, indigenous, and Hispanic people in the state's prisons.

6. In addition to the devastating and lasting psychological consequences of solitary confinement, recent studies have shown that people in these restrictive settings also have higher rates of medical concerns and have a shorter life expectancy once released to the community. Studies have also shown that people released to the community directly from solitary confinement also have higher recidivism rates.

## Section 4
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [72.09](/rcw/72_state_institutions/72.09_department_of_corrections.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/72_state_institutions/72.09_department_of_corrections.md) for context.

1. The use of solitary confinement in correctional facilities in this state shall be restricted as follows:

    a. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3)(a), (c), and (d) of this section:

        i. An incarcerated person shall not be placed in solitary confinement unless there is reasonable cause to believe that the incarcerated person would create a substantial risk of immediate serious harm to himself or another, as evidenced by recent threats or conduct, and a less restrictive intervention would be insufficient to reduce this risk.

        ii. An incarcerated person shall not be placed in solitary confinement for nondisciplinary reasons.

    b. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3)(a) of this section:

        i. An incarcerated person shall not be placed in solitary confinement before receiving a personal and comprehensive medical and mental health examination conducted by a qualified medical provider unless there is reasonable cause to believe that such advance evaluation would create a substantial threat to security or safety; in such instances an evaluation must occur within one hour of placement in solitary confinement.

        ii. An incarcerated person shall only be held in solitary confinement pursuant to initial procedures and reviews that provide timely, fair, and meaningful opportunities for the incarcerated person to contest the confinement. These procedures shall include the right to an initial hearing within 72 hours of placement; the right to appear at the hearing; the right to assistance at the hearing by a lay advisor or other person of their choosing, including but not limited to other incarcerated individuals, outside advocates, or retained counsel; an independent hearing officer; a written statement of reasons for the decision made at the hearing; and a written statement on how to appeal a hearing determination.

    e. A qualified medical provider shall conduct a mental health and physical health status examination for each incarcerated person placed in solitary confinement on a daily basis, in a confidential setting outside of the cell whenever possible, to determine whether the incarcerated person is a member of a vulnerable population. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, an incarcerated person determined to be a member of a vulnerable population shall be immediately removed from solitary confinement and moved to an appropriate placement.

    f. A disciplinary sanction of solitary confinement that has been imposed on an incarcerated person who is removed from solitary confinement pursuant to (e) of this subsection, shall be deemed to be satisfied.

    g. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3)(a) of this section, during a facility-wide lockdown, an incarcerated person shall not be placed in solitary confinement for more than 15 consecutive days, and for no more than 45 cumulative days during a single fiscal year.

2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, an incarcerated person who is a member of a vulnerable population shall not be placed in solitary confinement.

    a. An incarcerated person who is a member of a vulnerable population due to a mental disorder or developmental disability as defined in this section:

        i. Shall not be subject to discipline for refusing treatment or medication, for self-harming or related conduct or threats of this conduct, or for other behavior that is due to a disability; and

        ii. Who would otherwise be placed in solitary confinement shall be screened by a qualified medical provider for placement in a residential treatment unit or close observation unit for observation and assessment, or transferred to the least restrictive appropriate short-term care or psychiatric facility designated by the department of social and health services pursuant to RCW 72.68.031.

    b. An incarcerated person who is a member of a vulnerable population because the incarcerated person is under 25 or over 60 years of age, has a serious medical condition that cannot be effectively treated in solitary confinement, a physical disability that cannot be accommodated in solitary confinement, has significant auditory or visual impairment, is pregnant, is in the postpartum period, or has recently suffered a miscarriage or terminated a pregnancy, and who would otherwise be placed in solitary confinement, shall alternately be placed in an appropriate medical or other unit as designated by the secretary.

3. Solitary confinement shall be permitted under limited circumstances as follows:

    a. The superintendent or their designee determines that a facility-wide lockdown is required to ensure the safety of incarcerated persons in the facility until the superintendent or their designee determines that these circumstances no longer exist. The superintendent or designee shall document specific reasons why any lockdown is necessary for more than 24 hours and why less restrictive interventions are insufficient to accomplish the facility's safety goals. Within seven days, the secretary shall publish the reasons for the lockdown on the department of corrections website and provide meaningful notice of the reasons for the lockdown to the legislature and the office of the corrections ombuds.

    b. The superintendent determines that an incarcerated person should be placed in emergency confinement, provided that:

        i. An incarcerated person shall not be held in emergency confinement for more than 24 consecutive hours and for no more than 72 cumulative hours in a 30 day period; and

        ii. An incarcerated person held in emergency confinement shall receive an initial in-person medical and mental health evaluation prior to placement in emergency confinement unless there is reasonable cause to believe that an advance evaluation would create a substantial threat to security or safety. In such instances, an evaluation must occur within one hour of placement in emergency confinement. A comprehensive medical and mental health evaluation shall be conducted by a member of the medical staff within 12 hours of emergency confinement. Reports of these evaluations shall be immediately provided to the superintendent of the facility and the secretary.

    c. A qualified medical provider, based on a personal examination, determines that an incarcerated person should be placed or retained in medical isolation. The decision to place and retain an incarcerated person in medical isolation due to a mental health emergency shall be made by a qualified medical provider based on a personal examination. In any case of isolation under this subsection, an in-person clinical review shall be conducted at least every six hours and as clinically indicated. An incarcerated person in medical isolation pursuant to this subsection shall be placed in a residential treatment unit, a close observation unit, or a medical unit, as designated by the secretary.

    d. If the superintendent determines that an incarcerated person should be placed in solitary confinement in order to protect their safety, the safety of staff, or other incarcerated people, protective custody shall proceed as follows:

        i. The facility shall keep a written record of a request by an incarcerated person to be placed in solitary confinement for the purposes of voluntary protective custody. The incarcerated person may be placed in voluntary protective custody only with informed, written consent and when there is reasonable cause to believe that confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm. When an incarcerated person makes an informed, written request for such protective custody, the correctional facility shall bear the burden of establishing a basis for refusing the request.

        ii. The incarcerated person may be placed in solitary confinement for involuntary protective custody only when there is clear and convincing evidence that such confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm and that a less restrictive intervention would not be sufficient to prevent the harm. Placement in solitary confinement for involuntary protective custody shall not exceed 72 hours.

        iii. An incarcerated person placed in solitary confinement for the purposes of protective custody shall receive comparable opportunities for activities, movement, and social interaction, consistent with their safety and the safety of others as are available to incarcerated persons in the general population of the facility.

        iv. An incarcerated person subject to removal from solitary confinement for the purposes of protective custody shall be provided with a timely, fair, and meaningful opportunity to contest the removal.

    v. An incarcerated person who may be placed or currently is in solitary confinement for the purposes of voluntary protective custody may opt out of that status by providing informed, written refusal of that status.

    vi. The superintendent shall place an incarcerated person in a less restrictive intervention, including transfer to the general population of another institution or to any unit designated for incarcerated persons who face similar threats, before placing the incarcerated person in solitary confinement for either voluntary or involuntary protective custody unless the incarcerated person poses an extraordinary security risk so great that transferring the incarcerated person would be insufficient to ensure the incarcerated person's safety or the safety of others.

4. [Empty]

    a. An incarcerated person shall not be placed in solitary confinement pending investigation of a disciplinary offense unless:

        i. The incarcerated person's presence, in the general population, poses a serious and imminent danger to the incarcerated person, staff, other incarcerated persons, or the public.
