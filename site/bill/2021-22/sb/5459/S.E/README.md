## Section 1
The unique nature of payment system arrangements distinguishes payment card processing companies from other taxpayers. Due to the unique nature of payment card processing companies' activities related to interchange fees and network fees, the legislature intends to address the business and occupation taxation of payment card processing companies' activities on a prospective basis only, specifically for this industry through the deduction authorized in this act.


## Section 2
