1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, a major work on the state capitol grounds may be removed or relocated by the department of enterprise services:

    a. If approved by the legislation through concurrent resolution;

    b. To accommodate construction, repair, or improvements to the major work or to the surrounding state property on which the major work is located. Any major work that is permanently removed under this subsection must be relocated to a prominent location; or

    c. When a recommendation has been made by the work group under subsection (2) of this section or the department under subsection (3) of this section to remove or relocate a major work and the recommendation is approved by the state capitol committee. Any major work that is permanently removed under this subsection may be placed in storage or sold by the state if an alternative proposal is not authorized by the state capitol committee. If a major work is determined by the work group to be offensive or outdated, the major work may be destroyed.
