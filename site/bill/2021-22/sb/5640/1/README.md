In establishing the criteria, the department shall consider:

    e. The intangible impact on the state and local communities that comes with motion picture projects;

    f. The regional, national, and international competitiveness of the motion picture filming industry;

    g. The revitalization of the state as a premier venue for motion picture production and national television commercial campaigns;
