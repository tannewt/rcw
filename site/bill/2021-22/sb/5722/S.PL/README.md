# Substitute Senate Bill 5722 as Recommended by Environment, Energy & Technology - as passed by the Legislature

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5722-S.PL.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that in order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in RCW 70A.45.020, the state must require performance standards for existing buildings.

In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the need and potential for updating the state's building stock, including the "split incentive issue" in which tenants are responsible for energy costs and building owners are responsible for choices about energy systems and building maintenance, more robust benchmarking and reporting for building performance, operations, and maintenance is needed. While the state has adopted comprehensive reporting requirements for larger buildings, it currently lacks similar requirements for smaller buildings. It is the intent of the legislature to extend existing building benchmarking, energy management, and operations and maintenance planning requirements to smaller commercial and multifamily residential buildings in order to assess the needs and opportunities for job creation and incentives and environmental and public health improvements.

The legislature further finds that in order to meet the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits in the energy sectors of the economy, more resources must be directed toward achieving decarbonization of building heating and cooling loads, while continuing to relieve energy burdens that exist in overburdened communities. These resources must include comprehensive customer support, outreach, and technical assistance. These efforts must include notifying building owners of requirements through communications campaigns, providing resources to aid in compliance, and delivering training to equip building owners, and the industry, to be successful.

If the department certifies an application, it must provide verification to the building owner and each entity participating as provided in RCW 19.27A.240 and providing service to the building owner.

8. [Empty]

    a. **An eligible owner of a tier 1 covered building or an eligible owner of a multifamily residential building greater than 50,000 gross square feet, excluding the parking area,** that demonstrates early compliance with the applicable energy use intensity target under the standard established under RCW 19.27A.210 may receive a base incentive payment of **85** cents per gross square foot of floor area, excluding parking, unconditioned, or semiconditioned spaces.

    b. **A tier 2 eligible building owner that demonstrates compliance with the applicable benchmarking, energy management, and operations and maintenance planning requirements may receive a base incentive payment of 30 cents per gross square foot of floor area, excluding parking, unconditioned, or semiconditioned spaces. The department may implement a tiered incentive structure for upgrading multifamily buildings to provide an enhanced incentive payment to multifamily building owners willing to commit to antidisplacement provisions.**

9. The incentives provided in subsection (8) of this section are subject to the limitations and requirements of this section, including any rules or procedures implementing this section.

10. The department must establish requirements for the verification of energy consumption by the building owner and each participating electric utility, gas company, and thermal energy company.

13. The department may adopt rules to implement this section.


## Section 5
> This section modifies existing section [19.27A.230](/rcw/19_business_regulations—miscellaneous/19.027A_energy-related_building_standards.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/19_business_regulations—miscellaneous/19.027A_energy-related_building_standards.md) for context.

1. The department may not issue a certification for **a tier 1** incentive application under RCW 19.27A.220(8)(a) if doing so is likely to result in total incentive payments under RCW 19.27A.220(8)(a) in excess of **$75,000,000**.

2. **The department may not issue certification for a tier 2 incentive application under RCW 19.27A.220(8)(b) if doing so is likely to result in total incentive payments under RCW 19.27A.220(8)(b) in excess of $150,000,000.**


## Section 6

    a. Each qualifying utility must administer incentive payments for the state energy performance standard early adoption incentive program established in RCW 19.27A.220 on behalf of its customers who are eligible building owners of covered commercial buildings **,** multifamily residential buildings, **or other tier 2 covered buildings** consistent with the requirements of this section. Any thermal energy company, electric utility, or gas company not otherwise required to administer incentive payments may voluntarily participate by providing notice to the department in a form and manner prescribed by the department.

    b. Nothing in this subsection (1) requires a qualifying utility to administer incentive payments for the state energy performance standard early adoption incentive program established in RCW 19.27A.220 for which the qualifying utility is not allowed a credit against taxes due under this chapter**, as described in RCW 82.16.185**.

2. An entity that administers the payments for the incentive program under this section must administer the program in a manner that is consistent with the standard established and any rules adopted by the department under RCW 19.27A.210 **,** 19.27A.220**, and section 3 of this act**.

3. Upon receiving notification from the department that a building owner has qualified for an incentive payment, each entity that administers incentive payments under this section must make incentive payments to its customers who are eligible building owners of covered commercial buildings or multifamily residential buildings who qualify as provided under this section and at rates specified in RCW 19.27A.220(8). When a building is served by more than one entity administering incentive payments, incentive payments must be proportional to the energy use intensity reduction of the participating entities' fuel.

4. The participation by an entity in the administration of incentive payments under this section does not relieve the entity of any obligation that may otherwise exist or be established to provide customer energy efficiency programs or incentives.

5. An entity that administers the payments for the incentive program under this section is not liable for excess payments made in reliance on amounts reported by the department as due and payable as provided under RCW 19.27A.220, if such amounts are later found to be abnormal or inaccurate due to no fault of the business.


## Section 7
If specific funding for the purposes of this act, referencing this act by bill or chapter number, is not provided by June 30, 2022, in the omnibus appropriations act, this act is null and void.
