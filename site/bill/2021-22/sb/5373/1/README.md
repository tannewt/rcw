## Section 1
1. The emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, is a significant contributor to anthropogenic climate change, and has devastating adverse impacts on Washington's economy, environment, natural resources, and communities. Our state is already experiencing rising sea levels, depleting snowpack, increased flooding, acidifying oceans, and more frequent and severe wildfires. These impacts impair our prosperity and impose burdensome costs on our businesses and communities.

2. Climate risk is economic risk and it is imperative that Washington act now to safeguard the state's communities and industries against future shocks and disasters by putting a price on practices that increase the state's exposure to risk and investing in those that increase resilience. From farmers whose business is directly threatened by the climate crisis, to coastal communities at risk of outright displacement, the state must act now by investing locally at the scale needed to move all Washingtonians toward a future of shared prosperity as we build the clean economy here in Washington state.

3. Washington state is home to some of the world's most innovative companies, a highly skilled workforce, and important industries. As our state transitions away from a fossil fuel-based economy, we must do so in a way that protects these assets and allows our businesses to thrive. By launching a comprehensive fiscal program that incentivizes and invests in resilient infrastructure and climate-smart investments across all areas of development, we can reduce our state's carbon dioxide emissions while preparing our economy for the future.

4. The legislature recognizes that rural areas are home to the state's working and natural lands, including forests and farms, and have both climate-related challenges and opportunities that differ from urban areas. Rural workers have further distances to travel to their jobs and the state must provide assistance in the transition to lower-carbon transportation options. Rural areas may also have greater vulnerability to flooding, wildfires, and other events whose harm and frequency is increased by climate change, and state assistance should be directed toward increasing community resilience to these harms. Programs to reduce carbon pollution and to sequester carbon in the state's forests and farming soils also provide an opportunity to benefit the state's farmers and forestland owners.

5. More than half of Washington is forested with 22,000,000 acres of forests covering the state, including natural lands, private lands, and state trust lands. The private and state lands represent the foundation of a forest products industry that sequesters massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere simply through its standard, baseline operations. These working forests are one of the state's greatest natural assets in combating global greenhouse gas emissions. A statewide carbon policy must support and maintain the ecosystem values provided by the forest products industry. Healthy, sustainable, working forests maximize the forests' ability to absorb carbon dioxide with lumber and other forest products continuing to sequester that carbon dioxide in their useful life. For these reasons, this chapter exempts certain timber-related uses of fuels subject to the carbon pollution tax imposed under this chapter.

6. Washington is also home to one of the most productive and innovative agricultural sectors in the world. Agriculture is not only critical to our economy, but it is integral to our culture. With farmers and farmworkers on the front lines of climate-related disruption such as wildfire, flooding, drought, pests, and other threats to the land, labor, and the business of farming, investing in practices that increase the natural and economic resilience of and decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from Washington agriculture is critical. Farmers have been leading the way on land stewardship and soil health for decades, while operating in a highly trade-exposed and price-constrained industry that imposes singular economic challenges. For these reasons, this chapter exempts certain agricultural uses of fuels subject to the carbon pollution tax imposed under this chapter.

7. Washington is leading the transition to a clean energy economy and in 2019 adopted chapter 19.405 RCW, the clean energy transformation act, to eliminate coal-fired electricity, transition the state's electricity supply to 100 percent greenhouse gas neutral by 2030, 100 percent carbon free by 2045, and established strong compliance mechanisms and significant penalties within chapter 19.405 RCW if a utility fails to meet the mandates. Because of the laws created in 2019 to transition the electricity sector to 100 percent carbon free, emissions from fossil fuels consumed in the electricity sector is not included in the requirements of this chapter.

8. The legislature recognizes the concern from imposing the requirements of this chapter on energy intensive trade exposed industries in our state and the possibility that it might provide a comparative advantage to producers in unregulated states or countries, leading to a migration of manufacturing to unregulated states or countries and generating a corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions that would undermine the efforts of this chapter. Because of the concern of leakage, the department of ecology must provide a report to the legislature by July 30, 2026, with recommendations on imposing the requirements of this chapter on energy intensive trade exposed entities identified by North American industrial classification system code. The recommendations must include input from individual energy intensive trade exposed industries stakeholders, allow for growth, recognize and provide credit for early actions, recognize the limits of best available control technology, allow for either internal or external benchmarking, Â and include an analysis of alternative fuels available that could be feasibly used in lieu of fossil fuels.

9. Fossil-fuel combustion is also responsible for other pollutants, such as nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, benzene, particulate matter, and others that contribute to respiratory diseases like asthma and lung cancer, which compromise public health, shorten life expectancy, and strain our public health system. This pollution affects all Washingtonians, but falls disproportionately on low-income communities, communities of color, and the most vulnerable of our population. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will therefore contribute to improved air quality and improved public health outcomes.

10. The legislature recognizes and finds that the public interest includes, but is not limited to: The equitable distribution of energy benefits and reduction of burdens to vulnerable populations and highly impacted communities; long-term and short-term public health, economic, and environmental benefits and the reduction of costs and risks; and energy security and resiliency. It is the intent of the legislature that in achieving this policy for Washington, there should not be an increase in environmental health impacts to highly impacted communities.

11. This chapter establishes a carbon pollution tax to account for a significant share of the economic and environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. The revenue from the tax will facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy and fund investments that will benefit our businesses, our families, and our communities.

12. Furthermore, this chapter establishes a 10-year climate finance program that provides much needed additional capacity to invest in a just transition that protects our communities and our economy from future disasters and builds the low-carbon future here in Washington state. This finance program mandates that investment decisions are made in a manner that provides accountability in government spending through a fiscally responsible bond program that invests at scale in climate priorities and delivers maximum returns in the form of both economic activity and carbon pollution reduction. These investments will not only save Washington taxpayers billions of dollars in avoidable future costs, but also foster growth and stability for rural and urban communities alike, across diverse economic sectors.

Regardless of whether the state pursues third-party certification, bond proceeds must be used for projects that produce measurable climate mitigation or adaptation benefits.


## Section 10
1. The special tax obligation bonds authorized by this chapter may be issued for a period not to exceed 10 years. The authorization to issue bonds provided under section 9 of this act does not expire until the full authorization has been issued and dispersed, or until the end of the 10-year period, whichever occurs first. The state finance committee may choose to decrease the period of issuance based on updated forecasts and fiscal needs, but any increase in the period of issuance beyond the 10-year period authorized under this section requires the approval of the legislature.

2. On a quarterly basis, and in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, the state treasurer may submit a report to the legislature that provides recommendations on the level of issuances over the 10-year period based on updated revenue forecasts, market factors, and fiscal needs. No bond issuance may be structured such that debt service obligations remain past December 31, 2050.


## Section 11
Bonds authorized under this chapter are not a general obligation of the state and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of the state are not pledged for their payment. Each bond issued under the authority of this chapter shall distinctly state that payment or redemption of the bond and payment of the interest and any premium thereon is payable solely from and secured solely by a pledge of the carbon pollution tax revenues received in the climate finance account created in section 8 of this act, and is not a general obligation of the state. The legislature pledges to appropriate the carbon pollution tax revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds issued under this chapter. The state finance committee shall include this pledge and agreement of the state to owners of any bonds issued under this chapter. The owner of any bond or the trustee of the owner of any of the bonds may by mandamus or other appropriate proceeding require the transfer and payment of pledged funds as directed in this section.


## Section 12
The climate bond proceeds account is created in the state treasury. Proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized in section 9 of this act must be deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriations and only for project categories as described under sections 16 and 17 of this act and for the payment of expenses incurred in the issuance and sale of the bonds. If the state finance committee deems it necessary to issue the bonds authorized in section 9 of this act as taxable bonds in order to comply with federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds, the proceeds of such taxable bonds must be deposited into the climate bond proceeds account. The state treasurer shall submit written notice to the director of financial management if it is determined that any such transfer to the climate bond proceeds account is necessary.


## Section 13
The climate bond retirement account is created in the state treasury. Moneys in the account must be used only for the payment of principal and interest on bonds authorized in section 9 of this act. The state finance committee may provide that special subaccounts be created in the account to facilitate payment of the principal and interest on the bonds. The state finance committee shall, on or before June 30th of each year, certify to the state treasurer the amount needed in the ensuing 12 months to meet the bond retirement and interest requirements on the bonds authorized in section 9 of this act.


## Section 14
The state finance committee may issue bonds to refund outstanding bonds issued under this chapter, including the payment of any redemption premiums on the bonds and any interest accrued to or to accrue to the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding bonds. The proceeds of the refunding bonds may, at the discretion of the committee, be applied to the purchases or payment at maturity of the bonds to be refunded, or the redemption of the outstanding bonds on the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding bonds and may, until so used, be placed in escrow to be applied to the purchase, retirement, or redemption. Refunding bonds issued under this section must be issued and secured in the manner provided by the state finance committee.


## Section 15
1. It is the intent of the legislature that each year the total investments made through the climate bond proceeds account created in section 12 of this act, the greenhouse gas emissions reduction account created in section 16 of this act, and the natural climate solutions account created in section 17 of this act achieve the following, measured on a biennial basis:

    a. At least 35 percent of total investments authorized under this chapter must provide direct and meaningful benefits to vulnerable populations within the boundaries of highly impacted communities, as designated by the department of health under RCW 19.405.140;

    b. A minimum of 25 percent of total investments authorized under this chapter must be for the benefit of projects located in rural areas of the state. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(b), "rural counties" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.14.370. If the department determines that an adequate number of suitable applications for rural projects during any given funding cycle were not received, the department may allocate unused moneys for projects in other areas of the state; and

    c. At least 10 percent of the total investments authorized under this chapter must be used for programs, activities, or projects formally supported by a resolution of an Indian tribe, with priority given to otherwise qualifying projects directly administered or proposed by an Indian tribe. An investment that meets the requirements of this subsection (1)(c) and (b) may count toward the requisite minimum percentage for this subsection.

2. The expenditure of moneys under this chapter must be consistent with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and treaty rights including, but not limited to, prohibitions on uses of funds imposed by the state Constitution.

3. For the purposes of this section, "benefits" means investments or activities that:

    a. Reduce vulnerable population characteristics, environmental burdens, or associated risks that contribute significantly to the cumulative impact designation of highly impacted communities;

    b. Meaningfully protect a highly impacted community from, or support community response to, the impacts of air pollution or climate change; or

    c. Meet a community need identified by vulnerable members of the community that is consistent with the intent of this chapter.

        iii. Assist forestland owners in the protection of riparian and other sensitive aquatic areas by providing compensation for easements under the program created in chapter 76.13 RCW.

3. Moneys in the account may not be used for projects that would violate tribal treaty rights or result in significant long-term damage to critical habitat or ecological functions. Investments from this account must result in long-term environmental benefit and increased resilience to the impacts of climate change.


## Section 18
1. An environmental and economic justice panel is established to provide recommendations in the development and implementation of the programs, projects, and activities on greenhouse gas reduction and natural climate solutions authorized under this chapter. The departments of commerce, ecology, health, and transportation, the office of equity, and other state agencies as the governor may determine must coordinate and assist the panel.

2. The governor must appoint the members of the environmental and economic justice panel, which must be cochaired by one tribal leader and one person that is a representative of the interests of highly impacted communities identified by the department of health in its health disparities map. The membership of the panel must consist of at least 10 persons, based on the nomination of statewide organizations that represent the following interests:

    a. Five members, including at least one tribal leader, representing the interests of vulnerable populations residing in highly impacted communities in different geographic areas of the state and from rural as well as urban areas;

    b. Two members representing union labor with expertise in economic dislocation, clean energy economy, or energy-intensive, trade-exposed facilities;

    c. A member in addition to the tribal leader in (a) of this subsection to represent tribal governments; and

    d. Two members representing low-income and community advocacy organizations.

3. The governor may fill any position designated under subsection (2) of this section with a person who also serves upon the environmental justice council created in chapter . . ., (Senate Bill No. 5141), Laws of 2021 provided that such a person also meets the representative requirements of subsection (2) of this section.

4. The purpose of the panel is to:

    a. Provide recommendations in the development of investment plans and funding proposals for greenhouse gas reduction and natural climate solutions authorized under this chapter;

    b. Provide a forum to analyze policies adopted under this chapter to determine if the policies lead to improvements within highly impacted communities;

    c. Recommend procedures and criteria for evaluating programs, activities, or projects for funding consideration under this act;

    d. Evaluate the level of funding provided to assist vulnerable populations, low-income individuals, and displaced workers, and the funding of projects and activities located within or benefiting highly impacted communities;

    e. Provide recommendations to implementation agencies for meaningful consultation with vulnerable populations; and

    f. Periodically conduct an evaluation of the economic impacts on and outcomes for low and middle-income households and vulnerable populations, including communities of color and Indian tribal communities, of the emissions reduction policies required in this chapter and the financial assistance provided under this chapter.


## Section 19
1. In order to achieve the goals set forth in this chapter, any state agency receiving funding from the accounts created in this chapter must consult with Indian tribes on all decisions that may affect Indian tribes' rights and interests in their tribal lands. The consultation must occur pursuant to chapter 43.376 RCW and must be independent of any public participation process required by state law, or by a state agency, and regardless of whether the agency receives a request for consultation from an Indian tribe. A consultation framework must be developed in coordination with tribal governments that includes best practices, protocols for communication, and collaboration with Indian tribes.

2. No project that impacts tribal lands may be funded prior to meaningful consultation with affected Indian tribes. For projects that directly impact tribal lands, the goal of the consultation process is to obtain free, prior, and informed consent for the project, and at the end of such consultation, the project may not be funded unless the state agency first receives a written resolution providing consent or withholding consent. If any project that impacts tribal lands is funded under this chapter without consultation with Indian tribes, an affected Indian tribe may request that all further action on the project cease until consultation with any directly impacted Indian tribe is completed.


## Section 20
This chapter may be known and cited as the Washington sustainable transformative recovery opportunities for the next generation act.


## Section 22
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
