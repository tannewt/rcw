## Section 1

2. The task force provided recommendations to state agencies for measurable goals and model policies to reduce environmental health inequities in Washington, equitable practices for meaningful community involvement, and how to use the environmental health disparities map to identify overburdened communities. In order for all communities in Washington state to be healthy and thriving, state government must concentrate on communities that currently do not meet environmental health standards.

9. "Overburdened community" means a community designated by the council, with the assistance of the department of health, based on cumulative impact analyses of environmental harms upon vulnerable populations consistent with the definition of highly impacted community in RCW 19.405.020, and includes, but is not limited to, communities located in census tracts that are fully or partially on tribal lands, rural communities, and areas with a high concentration of members of a vulnerable population.

## Section 13
1. When considering the adoption of a significant agency action, an agency must conduct an environmental justice analysis as described in this section to better inform the agency in making its decision and to assist the agency with the equitable distribution of environmental investments, reduction of environmental harms, and the identification and reduction of racial and economic disparities.

2. In conducting an environmental justice analysis, an agency must:

    a. Utilize cumulative impact analysis, such as the environmental health disparities map, in conjunction with other qualitative assessments and evaluation of other factors, including both environmental and socioeconomic stressors that may cumulatively affect health and the environment and contribute to persistent environmental health disparities;

    b. Identify overburdened communities and vulnerable populations that may be affected by the proposed action and the cumulative positive and negative impacts and how those impacts may be distributed across communities;

    d. Summarize community input and describe how overburdened communities and affected tribes may be further involved in development of the proposed action; and

    e. Describe options for the agency to reduce the disproportionate impact on overburdened communities, or a reasonable justification for not doing so.

3. To obtain information for purposes of this section, an agency may survey a representative sample of members from the overburdened community and should, whenever possible, consult with representatives of overburdened communities to assist in the accurate assessment of the impact of the action and in developing the means to reduce or eliminate the impact on overburdened communities.

4. Based on the environmental justice analysis, the agency must reduce or eliminate the impacts imposed by the action on overburdened communities' vulnerable populations. The agency must consider, without limitation, each of the following methods for reducing such an impact:

6. An agency may develop rules for criteria and procedures applicable to environmental justice analyses and its decisions based on those analyses.


## Section 14
An agency must adopt a community engagement plan to evaluate new and existing services and programs for equitable participation and to support meaningful and direct involvement of vulnerable populations and overburdened communities. The plan must include:

## Section 17
1. An agency must incorporate environmental justice principles into its decision processes for budget development, making investments, granting or withholding benefits, and distributing funding in order to direct funding and investments towards communities highly impacted by pollution and climate change.

2. In making such decisions relating to budget development, making investments, granting or withholding benefits, and distributing funding, an agency must:

    a. Direct benefits to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities to reduce statewide disparities;

    b. Make investments proportional to the health disparities that a specific community experiences to eliminate the disparities;

    c. Focus investments on creating environmental benefits, including eliminating health burdens, creating community and population resilience, and raising the quality of life of those in the community;
