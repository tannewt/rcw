# Senate Bill 5910

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5910.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that while hydrogen fuel has been used in a variety of applications in the state, the source of hydrogen has been derived from fossil fuel feedstocks, such as natural gas. Hydrogen is an essential building block molecule that is necessary in the production of conventional and renewable fuels and a valuable decarbonization tool when used in sectors such as marine, aviation, steel, and cement, as well as surface transportation including light to heavy-duty trucking and drayage equipment. Hydrogen can be a carbon-free fuel with an energy per unit mass that is three to four times greater than jet fuel, whose energy can be extracted either through thermochemical (combustion) or electrochemical (fuel cell) processes. In both cases, the only by-product is water, instead of the greenhouse gases and other conventional and toxic pollutants that are emitted from using fossil fuels.

2. The legislature further finds that the use of renewable hydrogen and hydrogen produced from carbon-free electrolysis is an essential tool to a clean energy ecosystem and emissions reduction for challenging infrastructure needs. Clean hydrogen fuel can be produced or "charged" when the electrical supply grid has surplus renewable energy, at times of low electricity use such as evenings, then made available at times of higher need and convenient locations without having to build a major larger electrical supply system to meet higher peak demand for electricity.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends by this act to establish policies and a framework for the state to become a national and global leader in the production and use of these hydrogen fuels. This act will create an office of renewable fuels to: Promote partnerships among industrial, transportation, agriculture, and commercial interests as well as fuel producers, the technology research sector, and public sector agencies; identify barriers to and opportunities for market development; provide greater clarity and certainty in regulatory and siting standards; provide incentives and financial assistance in the deployment of hydrogen fuel infrastructure; support a clean and just energy transition; help create good quality, clean energy jobs; and improve air quality in degraded areas, particularly in communities that have borne disproportionate levels of air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels.

## Section 201
1. [Empty]

    a. The legislature finds that the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act, P.L. 117-58, provides $8,000,000,000 over five years to support the development of regional clean hydrogen hubs. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the United States secretary of energy to establish a program to fund at least four regional hubs to aid in achieving a hydrogen fuel production carbon intensity standard provided in that legislation; to demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage, and end use of hydrogen; and that can be developed into a national network to facilitate a clean hydrogen economy. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the secretary of energy to select regional hubs that demonstrate a diversity of feedstocks, a diversity of end uses, and a diversity of geographic regions of the country. The federal infrastructure investment and jobs act requires the secretary of energy to solicit proposals for regional hubs by May 15, 2022, and to make selections of the hubs within one year after the deadline for submission of proposals.

    b. The legislature further finds that Washington state is strongly positioned to develop a regional clean energy hub meeting the criteria of the federal infrastructure investment and jobs act because the state:

        i. Has adopted a state energy strategy that recognizes hydrogen as an integral part of the state's decarbonization pathway;

        ii. Has an abundance of low-cost, reliable electricity as the primary feedstock for production of clean hydrogen;

        iii. Already hosts several hydrogen fuel production facilities as well as production facilities in planning and design phases;

        iv. Has numerous industrial, maritime, and freight shipping concerns that are moving toward cleaner fuels and would help provide demand for hydrogen, as well as state and local governments currently considering hydrogen uses; and

    v. Has a demonstrated track record of building partnerships across the public and private sector to advance clean energy technologies.

    c. The legislature further finds that the state may help to promote and strengthen applications for regional hydrogen hub federal funding through state funding assistance to bring together multiple interests for the purpose of timely submitting applications to the United States secretary of energy for development of a regional hydrogen hub in Washington state.

2. Subject to amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the director of the department of commerce may provide funding to a port district, a public utility district, a city, a county, or any combination of such local governments, to assist in the preparation of an application to secure federal funding to develop a regional clean hydrogen hub in Washington state. If the director determines that a single application from a strong partnership in Washington state representing public and private sectors will make the application more competitive than supporting multiple applications, the director may not make more than one award of funding. The director shall solicit proposals that:

    a. Demonstrate a broad assembly of participants in developing and implementing the infrastructure of a regional hydrogen hub;

    b. Demonstrate that a strong and timely application will be submitted to the United States department of energy; and

    c. Include commitments from manufacturing industries, transportation, utilities, and other sectors to incorporate hydrogen fuels into their transition to cleaner energy.

3. In addition to the assistance in applying for federal funding provided through subsection (2) of this section, the legislature intends that the state fully support a regional clean energy hub in the state, including further direct financial assistance in developing the hub and the acquisition of hydrogen fuels for state agency and local government uses.


## Section 202

## Section 301
1. By December 1, 2024, the utilities and transportation commission must submit to the appropriate committees of the senate and house of representatives a report addressing the following regarding advancing the production and use of hydrogen fuel in the state:

    a. Whether the production and distribution of hydrogen fuels is a matter affected with the public interest in which the regulation of the rates and services should be assigned by the legislature to the utilities and transportation commission, as such regulation is provided for other public service companies such as natural gas companies;

    b. Whether electric utilities regulated by the commission should be required to analyze the costs and benefits of adopting special tariffs for the electrolytic production of hydrogen fuels;

    c. The adoption of safety standards for hydrogen fuel distribution, including ensuring consistency and clarity of standards applicable to distribution and end-use dispensing infrastructure throughout the state;

    d. Recommended standards for blending of hydrogen into natural gas distribution infrastructure; and

    e. The role that hydrogen fuel may serve as the state reduces greenhouse gas emissions from fossil natural gas, including findings and recommendations included in the commission's decarbonization inquiry required under section 143, chapter 334, Laws of 2021.

## Section 407
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [82.16](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.16_public_utility_tax.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.16_public_utility_tax.md) for context.

1. Beginning July 1, 2022, the tax levied under this chapter does not apply to sales of electricity made by a light and power business to an electrolytic hydrogen production business, a renewable hydrogen production business, or a business compressing, liquifying, or dispensing electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen, for 25 years from the date of commercial operation of the business, provided the commercial operation commences no later than July 1, 2032, and provided the contract for sale of electricity to the business contains the following terms:

    a. The electricity to be used in the electrolytic hydrogen production process, the renewable hydrogen production process, or the compression, liquification, or dispensing of the electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen is separately metered from the electricity used for general operations of the business; and

    b. The price charged for the electricity used in the electrolytic hydrogen production process, the renewable hydrogen production process, or the compression, liquification, or dispensing of electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen is reduced by an amount equal to the tax exemption available to the light and power business under this section.

2. The exemption provided for in this section does not apply to amounts received from the remarketing or resale of electricity originally obtained by contract for the production of electrolytic hydrogen, the production of renewable hydrogen, or the compression, liquification, or dispensing of electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen.

3. In order to claim an exemption under this section, a business engaged in the production of electrolytic hydrogen, the production of renewable hydrogen, or the compression, liquification, or dispensing of electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen must provide the light and power business with an exemption certificate in a form and manner prescribed by the department.

4. A person receiving the benefit of the exemption provided in this section must file a complete annual tax performance report with the department under RCW 82.32.534.

5. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Electrolytic hydrogen" means hydrogen produced through electrolysis, but does not include hydrogen manufactured using steam reforming or any other conversion technology that produces hydrogen from a fossil fuel feedstock.

    b. "Renewable hydrogen" means hydrogen produced using renewable resources both as the source for the hydrogen and the source for the energy input into the production process.


## Section 408
This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preference contained in section 407, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (section 407 of this act). The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.

1. The legislature categorizes the tax preference as one intended to induce certain designated behavior by taxpayers, as indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(a).

2. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to: Promote the construction and operation of renewable hydrogen and electrolytic hydrogen production and dispensing facilities in Washington; and provide tax treatment parity for electricity available to produce hydrogen from all of Washington's utilities serving the clean fuels markets, and tax treatment parity with the electricity used to charge and serve other storage technologies and transportation fuel markets. It is the legislature's intent to meet these public policy objectives by providing a public utility excise tax exemption on the sale of electricity used in the production of electrolytic hydrogen, the production of renewable hydrogen, and the compression, liquification, and dispensing of electrolytic hydrogen and renewable hydrogen, to reduce the average cost of electricity, which represents between 70 and 75 percent of the overall cost of operation of hydrogen electrolyzers and related infrastructure.

3. To measure the effectiveness of the tax preferences in section 407, chapter . . ., Laws of 2022 (section 407 of this act) in achieving the public policy objectives described in subsection (2) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee must, using calendar year 2021 as the baseline, evaluate the annual volumetric quantity of renewable hydrogen and electrolytic hydrogen produced in the state, as well as the annual percentage of hydrogen produced in the state that is either electrolytic hydrogen or renewable hydrogen.

4. In order to obtain the data necessary to perform the review in subsection (3) of this section, the department of revenue must provide data needed for the joint legislative audit and review committee analysis. In addition to the data source described under this subsection, the joint legislative audit and review committee may use any other data it deems necessary.


## Section 409
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [43.330](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.330_department_of_commerce.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.330_department_of_commerce.md) for context.

The renewable fuels accelerator account is created in the state treasury. Revenues to the account consist of appropriations made by the legislature, federal funds, gifts or grants from the private sector or foundations, and other sources deposited in the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account may be used only for purposes designated in sections 102 and 103 of this act. Only the director of the office or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account.


## Section 502
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
