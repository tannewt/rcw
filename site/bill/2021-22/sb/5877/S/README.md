## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [28B.92](/rcw/28B_higher_education/28B.092_state_student_financial_aid_programs.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28B_higher_education/28B.092_state_student_financial_aid_programs.md) for context.

1. Every four years, institutions of higher education participating in the Washington college grant program must either:

    a. Affirmatively opt out of compliance with (b) of this subsection; or

    b. Sign an affidavit affirming that the institution's policies and practices are in compliance with the following provisions:

        i. The institution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, sex, marital status, age, honorably discharged veteran or military status, sexual orientation, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability;

        ii. The institution operates its education program or activity in a manner free of discrimination. No student shall be excluded from participation in an education program or activity, denied the benefits of an education program or activity, or subjected to discrimination on the basis of that student's age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability, unless based upon a bona fide qualification of the educational program;

        iii. The institution, acting in its capacity as an employer, must not:

(A) Refuse to hire, promote, or confer tenure to any person because of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification. However, the prohibition against discrimination because of a disability in this subsection does not apply if the particular disability prevents the proper performance of the particular work involved. This subsection shall not be construed to require an employer to establish employment goals or quotas based on sexual orientation;

(B) Discharge or bar any person from employment because of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability;

(C) Discriminate against any person in compensation or in other terms or conditions of employment because of age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability. However, this section does not prohibit an employer from segregating washrooms or locker facilities on the basis of sex, or basing other terms and conditions of employment on the sex of employees where the Washington state human rights commission, created under chapter 49.60 RCW, has by regulation or ruling in a particular instance found the employment practice to be appropriate for the practical realization of equality of opportunity between the sexes;

(D) Print, or circulate, or cause to be printed or circulated any statement, advertisement, or publication, or to use any form of application for employment, or to make any inquiry in connection with prospective employment, which expresses any limitation, specification, or discrimination as to age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, citizenship or immigration status, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability, or any intent to make any such limitation, specification, or discrimination, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification. However, nothing in this subsection prohibits advertising in a foreign language.

2. Participation in theology academic programs; and employment, promotion, or tenure of faculty members for courses of study in theology are exempt from the requirements under this section.

3. Institutions of higher education that take no action regarding the signing of the affidavit shall be determined to have opted out of compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section. Institutions of higher education that opt out of compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section are still eligible to participate in the Washington college grant program if they maintain compliance with all other requirements for participation in the program as determined by the office. Institutions that opt out of compliance with subsection (1)(b) of this section are eligible for maximum grants as defined in RCW 28B.92.030(9)(h).

4. Institutions of higher education that have signed the affidavit under subsection (1)(b) of this section but are determined to have engaged in an unfair practice as provided under this section, are eligible for maximum grants as defined in RCW 28B.92.030(9)(h) for a period of four years from the beginning of the academic year immediately following the date of the decision.

5. It is an unfair practice if an institution of higher education which has signed an affidavit agreeing to comply with the requirements under subsection (1)(b) of this section then engages in the discriminatory practices prohibited under subsection (1)(b) of this section.

7. Any person believed to be injured by a violation of this section has a civil cause of action in court to enjoin further violations, or to recover the actual damages sustained by the person, or both, together with the cost of the suit including reasonable attorneys' fees or any other appropriate remedy authorized by state or federal law.
