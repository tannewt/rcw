## Section 4
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [46.04](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.04_definitions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.04_definitions.md) for context.

1. "Patches pal license plates" means special license plates issued under RCW 46.18.200 that display the likenesses of the J.P. Patches and Gertrude characters from the J.P. Patches show, or children's characters that are changed in accordance with subsection (2) of this section.

2. By October 1, 2031, and each decade thereafter, the department must consult with the Seattle children's hospital, and determine whether the Patches pal license plate design is the best design to support the Seattle children's hospital strong against cancer program in the following 10-year time period. If it is determined that a different group of appropriate children's characters would better support the program due to public interest at that time, the department must redesign the Patches pal license plates with these new characters and a new corresponding plate name. The costs associated with this redesign may be paid from the proceeds from the special license plate sales.
