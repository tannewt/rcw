# Substitute Senate Bill 5370 as Recommended by Subcommittee on Behavioral Health

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5370-S.pdf)
## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [71.32.010](/rcw/71_mental_illness/71.32_mental_health_advance_directives.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/71_mental_illness/71.32_mental_health_advance_directives.md) for context.

1. The legislature declares that an individual with capacity has the ability to control decisions relating to his or her own **behavioral** health care. The legislature finds that:

    a. Some **behavioral health disorders** cause individuals to fluctuate between capacity and incapacity;

    b. During periods when an individual's capacity is unclear, the individual may be unable to access needed treatment because the individual may be unable to give informed consent;

    c. Early treatment may prevent an individual from becoming so ill that involuntary treatment is necessary; and

    d. **Individuals with behavioral health disorders** need some method of expressing their instructions and preferences for treatment and providing advance consent to or refusal of treatment.

2. The legislature recognizes that a mental health advance directive can be an essential tool for an individual to express his or her choices at a time when the effects of **a behavioral health disorder** have not deprived him or her of the power to express his or her instructions or preferences.

3. The legislature further finds that:

    a. A mental health advance directive must provide the individual with a full range of choices;

    b. **Individuals with behavioral health disorders** have varying perspectives on whether they want to be able to revoke a directive during periods of incapacity;

    c. For a mental health advance directive to be an effective tool, individuals must be able to choose how they want their directives treated during periods of incapacity; and

    d. There must be clear standards so that treatment providers can readily discern an individual's treatment choices.

Consequently, the legislature affirms that, pursuant to other provisions of law, a validly executed mental health advance directive is to be respected by agents, guardians, and other surrogate decision makers, health care providers, professional persons, and health care facilities.

3. If the minor was provided with involuntary medication during the involuntary commitment period, the less restrictive alternative treatment order may authorize the less restrictive alternative treatment provider or its designee to administer involuntary antipsychotic medication to the person if the provider has attempted and failed to obtain the informed consent of the person and there is a concurring medical opinion approving the medication by a psychiatrist, physician assistant working with a supervising psychiatrist, psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner, or physician or physician assistant in consultation with an independent mental health professional with prescribing authority.

4. Less restrictive alternative treatment must be administered by a provider that is certified or licensed to provide or coordinate the full scope of services required under the less restrictive alternative order and that has agreed to assume this responsibility.

5. The care coordinator assigned to a minor ordered to less restrictive alternative treatment must submit an individualized plan for the minor's treatment services to the court that entered the order. An initial plan must be submitted as soon as possible following the intake evaluation and a revised plan must be submitted upon any subsequent modification in which a type of service is removed from or added to the treatment plan.

6. For the purpose of this section, "care coordinator" means a clinical practitioner who coordinates the activities of less restrictive alternative treatment. The care coordinator coordinates activities with the designated crisis responders that are necessary for enforcement and continuation of less restrictive alternative treatment orders and is responsible for coordinating service activities with other agencies and establishing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship with the individual on a continuing basis.
