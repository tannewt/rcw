## Section 1

1. The governing board of a nonprofit organization, corporation, or association may apply for deferral of taxes on an eligible project. Application must be made to the department in a form and manner prescribed by the department. The application must contain information regarding the location of the project, estimated or actual costs of the project, time schedules for completion and operation of the project, and other information required by the department. The department must rule on the application within sixty days. All applications for the tax deferral under this section must be received no later than December 31, 2008.

2. The department must issue a sales and use tax deferral certificate for state and local sales and use taxes due under chapters 82.08, 82.12, and 82.14 RCW on each eligible project.

3. [Empty]

    a. **Deferred tax payments due on December 31st of calendar years 2022 and 2023 need not be repaid. Payments must resume in calendar year 2024 and are due by December 31st of each calendar year thereafter, as provided in (b) of this subsection.**

    b. The nonprofit organization, corporation, or association must begin paying the deferred taxes in the **12th** year after the date certified by the department as the date on which the eligible project is operationally complete. The first payment is due on December 31st of the **12th** calendar year after such certified date, with subsequent annual payments due on December 31st of the following **seven** years. Each payment must equal ten percent of the deferred tax.

4. The department may authorize an accelerated repayment schedule upon request of the nonprofit organization, corporation, or association.

5. Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, interest may not be charged on any taxes deferred under this section for the period of deferral. The debt for deferred taxes is not extinguished by insolvency or other failure of the nonprofit organization, corporation, or association.

6. If the project is not operationally complete within five calendar years from issuance of the tax deferral or if at any time the department finds that the project is not eligible for tax deferral under this section, the amount of deferred taxes outstanding for the project is immediately due and payable. If deferred taxes must be repaid under this subsection, the department must assess interest, but not penalties, on amounts due under this subsection. Interest must be assessed at the rate provided for delinquent taxes under this chapter, retroactively to the date of deferral, and accrues until the deferred taxes due are repaid.

7. Applications and any other information received by the department of revenue under this section are not confidential under RCW 82.32.330. This chapter applies to the administration of this section.
