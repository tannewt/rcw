1. [Empty]

    a. Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, no person may knowingly sell or offer for sale any hemp cannabinoid product that is marketed or labeled as "CBD" or any other class B cannabinoid if the hemp cannabinoid product has less than the marketed or labeled concentration of CBD or any other class B cannabinoid or does not contain CBD or any other class B cannabinoid.

    b. Such a representation can be made orally or in writing, or by display of a sign, mark, insignia, or simulation.

2. A violation of this section constitutes a violation of the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

    a. "CBD" has the same meaning as "CBD product" as defined in RCW 69.50.101(e).

    b. "Class A cannabinoid" is a substance that meets the following structural and functional criteria:

        i. The substance exhibits the structural backbone of tetrahydrocannabinols and tetrahydrocannabinol-like (THC-like) molecules that include the interconnected three-ring system of a: Six-carbon aromatic ring; pyran ring; and cyclohexene ring. Known compounds that fit the description provided in this subsection (3)(b)(i) include:

(A) Tetrahydrocannabinols â€“ a single double-bond in the C ring:

(I) Delta-10-THC and isomers;

(II) Delta-9-THC and isomers;

(III) Delta-8-THC and isomers;

(IV) Delta-7-THC and isomers;

(V) Delta-6a-THC and isomers; and

(VI) Delta-10a-THC and isomers;

(B) Carboxylates (C-2 and C-4) of tetrahydrocannabinols:

(I) Delta-9-THCA acid (Delta-9-THCA);

(II) Similar carboxylates of Delta-9-THCA for tetrahydrocannabinols in (b)(i)(A)(I) through (VI) of this subsection; and

(III) Carboxylate esters in (b)(i)(A)(I) through (VI) of this subsection;

(C) Alkyl analogues (C-3) of tetrahydrocannabinols:

(I) Delta-9-THCP (Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabiphorol) and n-alkyl analogues;

(II) Similar alkylated analogues of Delta-9-THC for tetrahydrocannabinols in (b)(i)(A)(I) through (VI) of this subsection; and

(D) Hydroxylated analogues of tetrahydrocannabinols:

(I) 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC and 8- and 10-hydroxy analogues; and

(II) Similar hydroxylated analogues of Delta-9-THC for tetrahydrocannabinols in (b)(i)(A)(I) through (VI) of this subsection;

        ii. Possesses significant CB1 agonist activity as demonstrable by binding affinity (Ki) to the CB1 receptors at less than 200 nM; and

        iii. Results in positive effects for all four components of the tetrad test in rodents or reliably causes functional impairment in humans as assayed by a method possessing scientific consensus.

    c. "Class B cannabinoid" means all hemp cannabinoids that do not meet the form and function of class A cannabinoids.

    d. "Hemp cannabinoid product" means any consumable class B product derived from hemp as defined in RCW 15.140.020, which explicitly or implicitly markets cannabinoid concentration or otherwise contains a cannabinoid or cannabinoids to a significant degree for human or animal consumption above two percent.

    e. "Person" includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, and associations.

4. This section does not apply to products sold at a retail outlet licensed under RCW 69.50.325.
