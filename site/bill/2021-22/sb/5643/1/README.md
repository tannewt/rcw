## Section 1
As of July 2019, almost 22 percent of the population of Washington state was under 18 years of age. The legislature finds that it is critical to invest in both the formal and informal education of the youth of the state. While there are existing youth development programs in the state, it is in the best interest of the state to sponsor youth development programs offered by voluntary grassroots advocacy organizations focusing on agricultural education. In addition to science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and robotics, this youth development program will focus on animal husbandry and agricultural education.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [15.76](/rcw/15_agriculture_and_marketing/15.076_agricultural_fairs_youth_shows_exhibitions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/15_agriculture_and_marketing/15.076_agricultural_fairs_youth_shows_exhibitions.md) for context.

1. Voluntary grassroots advocacy organizations representing the social and economic interest of farm and ranch families at the local, state, and national levels may sponsor youth development programs to promote participation in agricultural fairs, youth shows, and exhibitions and education in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and robotics as well as animal husbandry and agricultural education. The youth development program must incorporate civics, civil society, and participation in government into its programming.

2. It is in the public interest to support youth participation in youth development programs, including youth development programs authorized in RCW 36.50.010. The legislature intends to appropriate funds to fulfill the enrollment fees owed to the programs by participants as an allocation under RCW 15.76.150.


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [36.50.010](/rcw/36_counties/36.050_farm_and_home_extension_work.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.050_farm_and_home_extension_work.md) for context.

The board of county commissioners of any county and the governing body of any municipality are authorized to establish and conduct extension work in agriculture and home economics in cooperation with Washington State University, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by any such board or governing body and the director of the extension service of Washington State University; and may employ such means and appropriate and expend such sums of money as may be necessary to effectively establish and carry on such work in agriculture and home economics in their respective counties and municipalities.

2. **Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the board of county commissioners of any county may implement health and safety requirements for any employees or volunteers operating in accordance with this statute.
