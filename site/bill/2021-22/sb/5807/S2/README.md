The department shall develop a staffing ratio reflecting an appropriate level of staffing per state hospital patient in consultation with the University of Washington.

8. Each state hospital shall include in its admission process identification of family and natural supports for the patient, an explanation to each patient of the role of the bureau, and determination of whether informed consent exists for involvement of family or natural supports in the patient's care. If the patient does not have the capacity to provide informed consent for this purpose, the involvement of family or natural supports shall be determined by consulting the patient's guardian or in a manner consistent with RCW 70.02.205.

9. The bureau shall coordinate with the office of behavioral health consumer advocacy under chapter 71.40 RCW as appropriate and may make appropriate referrals. A state hospital may expand the scope of the bureau to integrate with the activities of any internal consumer advocacy office.
