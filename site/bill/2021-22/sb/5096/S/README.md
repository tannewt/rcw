The penalty under this subsection is in addition to any penalties assessed for the late payment of any tax due on the return.

    b. The department must waive or cancel the penalty imposed under this subsection if:

        i. The department is persuaded that the taxpayer's failure to file the return by the due date was due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control; or

        ii. The taxpayer has not been delinquent in filing any return due under this section during the preceding five calendar years.

State registered domestic partners may file a joint return under this chapter even if they filed separate federal returns for the taxable year.

## Section 112

## Section 113
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [82.04](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.04_business_and_occupation_tax.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.04_business_and_occupation_tax.md) for context.

1. To avoid taxing the same sale or exchange under both the business and occupation tax and capital gains tax, a credit is allowed against taxes due under this chapter on a sale or exchange that is also subject to the tax imposed under section 102 of this act. The credit is equal to the amount of tax imposed under this chapter on such sale or exchange.

2. The credit may be used against any tax due under this chapter.

3. The credit under this section is earned in regards to a sale or exchange, and may be claimed against taxes due under this chapter, for the tax reporting period in which the sale or exchange occurred. The credit claimed for a tax reporting period may not exceed the tax otherwise due under this chapter for that tax reporting period. Unused credit may not be carried forward or backward to another tax reporting period. No refunds may be granted for unused credit under this section.

4. The department must apply the credit first to taxes deposited into the general fund. If any remaining credit reduces the amount of taxes deposited into the workforce education investment account established in RCW 43.79.195, the department must notify the state treasurer of such amounts monthly, and the state treasurer must transfer those amounts from the general fund to the workforce education investment account.


## Section 114

1. The department may enter into reciprocal tax collection agreements with the taxing officials of any other state imposing a specified tax. Agreements authorized under this section must require each state to offset delinquent specified taxes owed by a taxpayer to one party to the agreement, including any associated penalties, interest, or other additions, against refunds of overpaid specified taxes owed to the taxpayer by the other party to the agreement. Such agreements may also include provisions governing the sharing of information relevant to the administration of specified taxes. However, the department may not share return or tax information with other states except as allowed under RCW 82.32.330. Likewise, the department may not share federal tax information with other states without the express written consent of the internal revenue service.

2. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Specified taxes" means generally applicable state and local sales taxes and use taxes, broad-based state gross receipts taxes, state income taxes, and stand-alone state taxes on capital gains or interest and dividends. "Specified taxes" includes, but is not limited to, the taxes imposed in, or under the authority of, chapters 82.04, 82.08, 82.12, 82.14, 82.16, and 82.--- RCW (the new chapter created in section 202 of this act), and similar taxes imposed by another state. For purposes of this subsection (2)(a), "gross receipts tax," "income tax," "sales tax," and "use tax" have the same meanings as provided in RCW 82.56.010.

    b. "State" has the same meaning as provided in RCW 82.56.010.


## Section 115
The first $350,000,000 in revenues from taxes collected under this chapter during any calendar year, as well as penalties and interest collected during the calendar year, must be deposited into the education legacy trust account created under RCW 83.100.230. The remainder shall be deposited into the taxpayer relief account hereby created in the state treasury.

## Section 203
1. If a court of competent jurisdiction, in a final judgment not subject to appeal, adjudges section 102 of this act unconstitutional, or otherwise invalid, in its entirety, section 113 of this act is null and void in its entirety. Any credits previously claimed under section 113 of this act must be repaid within 30 days of the department of revenue's notice to the taxpayer of the amount due.

2. If the taxpayer fails to repay the credit by the due date, interest and penalties as provided in chapter 82.32 RCW apply to the deficiency.


## Section 204
If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.
