<ol>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a county, city, town, school district, fire district, or port district may conduct its elections using ranked choice voting. A county, city, town, school district, fire district, or port district that adopts ranked choice voting may, but need not, use ranked choice voting for all offices in an election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A city, town, school district, fire district, or port district that has voters in more than one county may conduct an election using ranked choice voting only if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Another city, town, or district that lies entirely within at least two of the counties in which the city, town, or district has voters uses ranked choice voting; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A court orders the use of ranked choice voting as provided in this section as a remedy under RCW 29A.92.110.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ranked choice voting may not be used in an election for an office for which two or fewer candidates are competing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An election using ranked choice voting must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The county auditor shall design the ballot to allow a voter to rank the candidates for a particular office in order of preference, including one write-in candidate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor must allow a voter to rank at least five candidates per office. The secretary of state must adopt rules that determine the maximum number of candidates per office that a voter is allowed to rank on a ballot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A voter does not need to rank the maximum number of candidates. The county auditor shall count a ballot regardless of how many candidates the voter has ranked. The county auditor shall not assign votes for rankings made by a voter that are greater than the maximum number of rankings allowed for each office;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a voter skips one or more numbers in ranking candidates, or ranks an invalid write-in candidate, the county auditor shall assign any votes after the skipped number to the voter's next-highest ranked candidates as if the voter had not skipped the number;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a voter provides the same number ranking to more than one candidate, the county auditor may not assign that vote ranking to any candidate and may not assign a vote for any subsequent number ranking for that office;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the requisite number of officers have not been elected, or selected to continue to further rounds of vote tabulation, by reason of two or more persons having an equal and highest number of votes for the same office, the official empowered by state law to issue the original certificate of election shall resolve the tie as provided in RCW 29A.60.221.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A county, city, town, or district that adopts ranked choice voting before 2023 shall implement ranked choice voting for elections beginning in 2025. A county, city, town, or district that adopts ranked choice voting during or after 2023 must implement ranked choice voting within two years following its adoption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The county auditor whose county encompasses a county, city, town, or district that adopts ranked choice voting is responsible for the implementation of the system. If a city, town, or district has voters in two or more counties, each county auditor in which the city, town, or district has voters is responsible for its implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of state, before July 1, 2024, and in consultation with the ranked choice voting work group created in section 12 of this act, shall adopt rules to administer this section. The secretary's rules must address, at minimum:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Procedures for administering an election that includes voters in more than one county as provided in subsection (2) of this section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures for tabulating votes under this section; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum number of candidates a voter is allowed to rank for each office as provided in subsection (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary of state shall develop educational materials for the public and provide training for county auditors to implement ranked choice voting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As used in this section, &quot;ranked choice voting&quot; means a system of counting votes in which votes are tabulated based on a voter's ranking of candidates in order of preference using a system of counting votes in which the ballots are counted in rounds simulating a series of runoffs until two candidates remain or until one candidate has a majority of all votes counting in that round. The candidate having the greatest number of votes is declared the winner.</p>
