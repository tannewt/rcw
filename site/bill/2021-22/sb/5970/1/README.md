# Senate Bill 5970

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5970.pdf)
## Section 1
Voters have repeatedly approved initiatives limiting vehicle costs, yet politicians keep ignoring the voters' repeated, unambiguous mandate by imposing higher and higher vehicle taxes and fees. It's not fair and it must stop. Without this follow-up ballot measure, vehicle costs will continue to skyrocket until vehicle charges are obscenely expensive, as they were prior to Initiative 695. This act and each of its provisions limit state and local taxes, fees, and other charges relating to motor vehicles. This act would limit annual motor vehicle license fees to $30, except voter-approved charges; repeal and remove authority to impose certain vehicle taxes and charges; and base vehicle taxes on Kelley Blue Book.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [46.17](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.17_vehicle_fees.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.17_vehicle_fees.md) for context.

1. State and local motor vehicle license fees may not exceed $30 per year for motor vehicles, regardless of year, value, make, or model.

2. For the purposes of this section, "state and local motor vehicle license fees" means the general license tab fees paid annually for licensing motor vehicles, including but not limited to cars, sport utility vehicles, light trucks under RCW 46.17.355, motorcycles, and motor homes, and do not include charges approved by voters after the effective date of this section. This annual fee must be paid and collected annually and is due at the time of initial and renewal vehicle registration.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [46.17.355](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.17_vehicle_fees.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.17_vehicle_fees.md) for context.

    a. Except as provided in this section, payment of the tax imposed by this chapter or chapter 82.08 RCW by one purchaser or user of tangible personal property, extended warranty, digital good, digital code, digital automated service, or other service does not have the effect of exempting any other purchaser or user of the same property, extended warranty, digital good, digital code, digital automated service, or other service from the taxes imposed by such chapters.

    b. The tax imposed by this chapter does not apply:

        i. If the sale to, or the use by, the present user or his or her bailor or donor has already been subjected to the tax under chapter 82.08 RCW or this chapter and the tax has been paid by the present user or by his or her bailor or donor;

    b. **The amount of the transfers in each fiscal year pursuant to this subsection (6) shall be based on the revenue loss to each respective account from this act as projected in the quarterly transportation revenue forecast produced by the office of financial management in the spring prior to the start of each fiscal year.**


## Section 9
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [82.44](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.44_motor_vehicle_excise_tax.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.44_motor_vehicle_excise_tax.md) for context.

1. Any motor vehicle excise tax must be calculated in an honest and accurate way so the burden on vehicle owners is not artificially inflated. For the purpose of determining a vehicle tax, a taxing district imposing a vehicle tax must set a vehicle's taxable value at the vehicle's base model Kelley Blue Book value. This ensures an honest and accurate calculation of the tax and, combined with the appeal process in RCW 82.44.065, ensures that vehicle owners are taxed on their vehicle's market value.

2. For the purpose of determining a tax under this chapter, the value of a truck-type power or trailing unit, or motor vehicle, including a passenger vehicle, motorcycle, motor home, sport utility vehicle, or light duty truck is the base model Kelley Blue Book value of the vehicle, excluding applicable federal excise taxes, state and local sales or use taxes, transportation or shipping costs, or preparatory or delivery costs.

These dedicated funding sources, as set forth in RCW 81.104.150, 81.104.160, 81.104.170, and 81.104.175, are authorized only for agencies located in (a) each county with a population of **210,000** or more and (b) each county with a population of from **125,000** to less than **210,000** except for those counties that do not border a county with a population as described under (a) of this subsection. In any county with a population of **1,000,000** or more or in any county having a population of **400,000** or more bordering a county with a population of **1,000,000** or more, these funding sources may be imposed only by a regional transit authority or a regional transportation investment district. Regional transportation investment districts may, with the approval of the regional transit authority within its boundaries, impose the taxes authorized under this chapter, but only upon approval of the voters and to the extent that the maximum amount of taxes authorized under this chapter have not been imposed.

2. Agencies planning to construct and operate a high capacity transportation system should also seek other funds, including federal, state, local, and private sector assistance.

3. Funding sources should satisfy each of the following criteria to the greatest extent possible:

    a. Acceptability;

    b. Ease of administration;

    c. Equity;

    d. Implementation feasibility;

    e. Revenue reliability; and

5. Except for the regular property tax authorized in RCW 81.104.175, the authorization in subsection (4) of this section may not adversely affect the funding authority of transit agencies not provided for in this chapter. Local option funds may be used to support implementation of interlocal agreements with respect to the establishment of regional high capacity transportation service.

This document must be provided to the voters at least **20** days prior to the date of the election.

9. For any election in which voter approval is sought for a high capacity transportation system plan and financing plan pursuant to RCW 81.104.040, a local voter's pamphlet must be produced as provided in chapter 29A.32 RCW.

In order to effectuate the policies, purposes, and intent of this act and to ensure that the motor vehicle excise taxes repealed by this act are no longer imposed or collected, an authority that imposes a motor vehicle excise tax under RCW 81.104.160 must fully retire, defease, or refinance any outstanding bonds issued under this chapter if:

1. Any revenue collected prior to the effective date of this section from the motor vehicle excise tax imposed under RCW 81.104.160 has been pledged to such bonds; and

2. The bonds, by virtue of the terms of the bond contract, covenants, or similar terms, may be retired or defeased early or refinanced.


## Section 14
> This section modifies existing section [81.104.160](/rcw/81_transportation/81.104_high_capacity_transportation_systems.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/81_transportation/81.104_high_capacity_transportation_systems.md) for context.

1. Regional transit authorities that include a county with a population of more than **1,500,000** may submit an authorizing proposition to the voters, and if approved, may levy and collect an excise tax, at a rate approved by the voters, but not exceeding **two-tenths** of one percent on the value, under chapter 82.44 RCW, of every motor vehicle owned by a resident of the taxing district, solely for the purpose of providing high capacity transportation service. The maximum tax rate under this subsection does not include a motor vehicle excise tax approved before July 15, 2015, if the tax will terminate on the date bond debt to which the tax is pledged is repaid. This tax does not apply to vehicles licensed under RCW 46.16A.455 except vehicles with an unladen weight of **6,000** pounds or less, RCW 46.16A.425 or 46.17.335(2). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection or chapter 82.44 RCW, a motor vehicle excise tax imposed by a regional transit authority before or after July 15, 2015, must comply with chapter 82.44 RCW as it existed on January 1, 1996, until December 31st of the year in which the regional transit authority repays bond debt to which a motor vehicle excise tax was pledged before July 15, 2015. Motor vehicle taxes collected by regional transit authorities after December 31st of the year in which a regional transit authority repays bond debt to which a motor vehicle excise tax was pledged before July 15, 2015, must comply with chapter 82.44 RCW as it existed on the date the tax was approved by voters.

2. An agency and high capacity transportation corridor area may impose a sales and use tax solely for the purpose of providing high capacity transportation service, in addition to the tax authorized by RCW 82.14.030, upon retail car rentals within the applicable jurisdiction that are taxable by the state under chapters 82.08 and 82.12 RCW. The rate of tax may not exceed 2.172 percent. The rate of tax imposed under this subsection must bear the same ratio of the 2.172 percent authorized that the rate imposed under subsection (1) of this section bears to the rate authorized under subsection (1) of this section. The base of the tax is the selling price in the case of a sales tax or the rental value of the vehicle used in the case of a use tax.

3. Any motor vehicle excise tax previously imposed under the provisions of **subsection (1) of this section** shall be repealed, terminated, and expire on December 5, 2002, except for a motor vehicle excise tax for which revenues have been contractually pledged to repay a bonded debt issued before December 5, 2002, as determined by , 159 Wn.2d 16, 148 P.3d 1002 (2006). In the case of bonds that were previously issued, the motor vehicle excise tax must comply with chapter 82.44 RCW as it existed on January 1, 1996.

4. If a regional transit authority imposes the tax authorized under subsection (1) of this section, the authority may not receive any state grant funds provided in an omnibus transportation appropriations act except transit coordination grants created in chapter 11, Laws of 2015 3rd sp. sess.
