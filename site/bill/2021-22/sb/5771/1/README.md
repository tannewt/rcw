## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Nearly three-fourths of available jobs in this state require at least a postsecondary credential and that meeting this workforce need requires educating older adults who lack basic education skills;

    c. It is necessary to educate older adults who lack basic education skills to meet the state's educational attainment goals that all adults in the state ages 18 to 44 have a high school diploma or equivalent by 2023 and at least 70 percent of Washington adults ages 18 to 44 will have a postsecondary credential by 2023;

    d. The community and technical colleges are responsible for providing basic skills and literacy education to adults and fulfill this responsibility by teaching reading, writing, mathematics, technology, and English language skills to adults to prepare them to earn high school diplomas or achieve high school equivalency certificates; teach employability skills such as critical thinking, communication, problem solving, and decision making; and offer clear pathways to college-level education and credentials;

    e. The community and technical colleges offer an open door to every resident, regardless of academic background, experience, or economic means; and

    f. Knowledge of the true and accurate number of adults requiring basic education will provide the legislature with important information to potentially increase access to educational pathways leading to postsecondary credentials, living wage jobs, and meaningful participation in this state's democracy.

2. The legislature intends to provide a regular dependable forecast through the caseload forecast council to better understand the need for basic education for adults in the state.
