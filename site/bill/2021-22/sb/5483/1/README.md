## Section 301
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [36.01](/rcw/36_counties/36.001_general_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/36_counties/36.001_general_provisions.md) for context.

1. A statewide annual special transportation benefit assessment is imposed on developed parcels for the purposes of mitigating the impacts of growth on state transportation infrastructure throughout the state. The amount of the transportation benefit assessment is the increase in assessed value for the parcel resulting from new construction multiplied by the applicable rate:

    a. For residential developed parcels the rate is $1.50 per $1,000 of assessed value resulting from new construction;

    b. For manufacturing developed parcels the rate is one dollar per $1,000 of assessed value resulting from new construction; and

    c. For all other developed parcels not otherwise described in (a) or (b) of this subsection (1), the rate is $3 per $1,000 of assessed value resulting from new construction.

2. Parcels that are classified as designated forestland under chapter 84.33 RCW or designated agriculture land or timberland under chapter 84.34 RCW are exempt from the transportation benefit assessment imposed in this section.

3. To determine the appropriate designation of the parcel for purposes of applying the rate under subsection (1) of this section, county assessors may use land use codes or data collected from parcel investigations, or both, obtained in their normal course of business with respect to administering property taxes. The amount of the transportation benefit assessment constitutes a lien against the property. The assessment is subject to the same provisions as those for property tax collections, as provided in RCW 84.56.020 and must be collected by the county treasurer under the authority in RCW 84.56.035. The transportation benefit assessment fee must be collected concurrently with property taxes levied for collection in calendar year 2023 and thereafter.

4. All revenues generated under this section must be transferred to the state treasurer to be deposited into the forward flexible account created in section 802 of this act.

5. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Developed parcel" means any parcel altered from the natural state by the construction, creation, or addition of structures or other impervious surfaces.

    b. "Land use code" means restrictions on the type of development for a specific parcel of land as identified by records maintained by the assessor or supplemented by information resulting from investigation and generally conforming with the department of revenue's two-digit land use codes in WAC 458-53-030.

    c. "Manufacturing developed parcel" means any developed parcel used for manufacturing purposes.

    d. "Parcel" means the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an identified owner, boundaries, and surface area that is documented for property tax purposes and given a tax lot number by the assessor.

    e. "Residence" means a building or structure or portion thereof, designed for and used to provide a place of abode for human beings. "Residence" includes "residential" or "residential unit" as referring to the type of or intended use of a building or structure.

    f. "Residential parcel" means any developed parcel that contains no more than four residences or four residential units within a single structure and used primarily for residential purposes.

Tender may be conditioned on return of the subject vehicle if previously delivered to the buyer or lessee.

The provisions of this subsection (4)(a) do not impair, prejudice, or abrogate the rights of a dealer to assert a claim against the buyer or lessee for misrepresentation or breach of contract and to exercise all remedies available at law or in equity, including those under chapter 62A.9A RCW, if the dealer, bank, or other lender or leasing company discovers that approval of the contract or financing or approval of the lease was based upon material misrepresentations made by the buyer or lessee, including, but not limited to, misrepresentations regarding income, employment, or debt of the buyer or lessee, as long as the dealer, or his or her staff, has not, with knowledge of the material misrepresentation, aided, assisted, encouraged, or participated, directly or indirectly, in the misrepresentation.

A dealer may inform a buyer or lessee under this subsection (4)(a) regarding the unconditional acceptance or rejection of the contract, lease, or financing by sending an email message to the buyer's or lessee's supplied email address, by phone call, by leaving a voice message or sending a text message to a phone number provided by the buyer or lessee, by in-person oral communication, by mailing a letter by first-class mail if the buyer or lessee expresses a preference for a letter or declines to provide an email address and a phone number capable of receiving a free text message, or by another means agreed to by the buyer or lessee or approved by the department, effective upon the execution, mailing, or sending of the communication and before expiration of the "bushing" period;

    b. Permits the dealer to renegotiate a dollar amount specified as trade-in allowance on a vehicle delivered or to be delivered by the buyer or lessee as part of the purchase price or lease, for any reason except:

        ii. Substantial physical damage or latent mechanical defect occurring before the dealer took possession of the vehicle and which could not have been reasonably discoverable at the time of the taking of the order, offer, or contract; or

        iii. Excessive additional miles or a discrepancy in the mileage. "Excessive additional miles" means the addition of five hundred miles or more, as reflected on the vehicle's odometer, between the time the vehicle was first valued by the dealer for purposes of determining its trade-in value and the time of actual delivery of the vehicle to the dealer.

9. For a dealer, salesperson, or mobile home manufacturer, having taken an instrument or cash "on deposit" from a purchaser or lessee prior to the delivery of the bargained-for vehicle, to commingle the "on deposit" funds with assets of the dealer, salesperson, or mobile home manufacturer instead of holding the "on deposit" funds as trustee in a separate trust account until the purchaser or lessee has taken delivery of the bargained-for vehicle. Delivery of a manufactured home shall be deemed to occur in accordance with RCW 46.70.135(5). Failure, immediately upon receipt, to endorse "on deposit" instruments to such a trust account, or to set aside "on deposit" cash for deposit in such trust account, and failure to deposit such instruments or cash in such trust account by the close of banking hours on the day following receipt thereof, shall be evidence of intent to commit this unlawful practice: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That a motor vehicle dealer may keep a separate trust account which equals his or her customary total customer deposits for vehicles for future delivery. For purposes of this section, "on deposit" funds received from a purchaser of a manufactured home means those funds that a seller requires a purchaser to advance before ordering the manufactured home, but does not include any loan proceeds or moneys that might have been paid on an installment contract.

However, the buyer's agent may use a power of attorney for physical delivery of motor vehicle license plates to the consumer.

Further, it is unlawful for a buyer's agent to engage in any false, deceptive, or misleading advertising, disseminated in any manner whatsoever, including but not limited to making any claim or statement that the buyer's agent offers, obtains, or guarantees the lowest price on any motor vehicle or words to similar effect.

    a.

    b. Cancel or fail to renew the franchise or selling agreement of any vehicle dealer doing business in this state without fairly compensating the dealer at a fair going business value for his or her capital investment which shall include but not be limited to tools, equipment, and parts inventory possessed by the dealer on the day he or she is notified of such cancellation or termination and which are still within the dealer's possession on the day the cancellation or termination is effective, if: (i) The capital investment has been entered into with reasonable and prudent business judgment for the purpose of fulfilling the franchise; and (ii) the cancellation or nonrenewal was not done in good faith. Good faith is defined as the duty of each party to any franchise to act in a fair and equitable manner towards each other, so as to guarantee one party freedom from coercion, intimidation, or threats of coercion or intimidation from the other party: PROVIDED, That recommendation, endorsement, exposition, persuasion, urging, or argument are not deemed to constitute a lack of good faith;

    c. Encourage, aid, abet, or teach a vehicle dealer to sell or lease vehicles through any false, deceptive, or misleading sales or financing practices including but not limited to those practices declared unlawful in this section;

    f. To provide under the terms of any warranty that a purchaser or lessee of any new or unused vehicle that has been sold or leased, distributed for sale or lease, or transferred into this state for resale or lease by the vehicle manufacturer may only make any warranty claim on any item included as an integral part of the vehicle against the manufacturer of that item.

Nothing in this section may be construed to impair the obligations of a contract or to prevent a manufacturer, distributor, representative, or any other person, whether or not licensed under this chapter, from requiring performance of a written contract entered into with any licensee hereunder, nor does the requirement of such performance constitute a violation of any of the provisions of this section if any such contract or the terms thereof requiring performance, have been freely entered into and executed between the contracting parties. This paragraph and subsection (14)(b) of this section do not apply to new motor vehicle manufacturers governed by chapter 46.96 RCW.

A manufacturer or new motor vehicle dealer is not required to disclose to a dealer or buyer that glass, tires, bumpers, or cosmetic parts of a new motor vehicle were damaged at any time if the damaged item has been replaced with original or comparable equipment. A replaced part is not part of the cumulative damage required to be disclosed under this subsection.

    b. A manufacturer is required to provide the same disclosure to a dealer of any known damage or repair as required in (a) of this subsection.

    c. If disclosure of any known damage or repair is not required under this section, a buyer may not revoke or rescind a sales contract due to the fact that the new motor vehicle was damaged and repaired before completion of the sale.

        i. "Cosmetic parts" means parts that are attached by and can be replaced in total through the use of screws, bolts, or other fasteners without the use of welding or thermal cutting, and includes windshields, bumpers, hoods, or trim panels.

        ii. "Manufacturer's suggested retail price" means the retail price of the new motor vehicle suggested by the manufacturer, and includes the retail delivered price suggested by the manufacturer for each accessory or item of optional equipment physically attached to the new motor vehicle at the time of delivery to the new motor vehicle dealer that is not included within the retail price suggested by the manufacturer for the new motor vehicle.
