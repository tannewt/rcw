## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [51.32](/rcw/51_industrial_insurance/51.32_compensation—right_to_and_amount.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/51_industrial_insurance/51.32_compensation—right_to_and_amount.md) for context.

1. For frontline employees who are covered under this title, there exists a prima facie presumption that any infectious or contagious diseases that are transmitted through respiratory droplets or aerosols, or through contact with contaminated surfaces and are the subject of a public health emergency are occupational diseases under RCW 51.08.140 during a public health emergency.

2. The frontline employee must provide verification, as required by the department by rule, to the department and the self-insured employer that the employee has contracted the infectious or contagious disease that is the subject of the public health emergency.

3. This presumption of occupational disease may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that:

    a. The exposure to the infectious or contagious disease which is the subject of the public health emergency occurred from other employment or nonemployment activities; or

    b. The employee was working from the employee's home, on leave from the employee's employment, or some combination thereof, for the period of quarantine consistent with recommended guidance from state and federal health officials for the disease immediately prior to the employee's injury, occupational disease, or period of incapacity that resulted from exposure to the disease which is the subject of the public health emergency.

4. [Empty]

    a. RCW 51.32.090(7) does not apply to an occupational disease under this section except that no worker shall receive compensation for or during the day on which the occupational disease was contracted. For the purposes of this subsection (4), the day on which the occupational disease was contracted is whichever date occurs first of the following:

        i. The date that the worker first missed work due to symptoms of the infectious or contagious disease;

        ii. The date the worker was quarantined by a medical provider or public health official; or

        iii. The date the worker received a positive test result confirming contraction of the infectious or contagious disease.

    b. If leave or similar benefits are paid to the frontline employee as part of a federal or state program for these employees during the public health emergency, temporary total disability benefits are not payable for the same period of time covered by the federal or state program.

5. When calculating assessments due to the department for which total claim costs are the basis, self-insured employers and self-insurance hospital groups formed under RCW 51.14.150 and 51.14.160 may deduct the cost of payments made under this section from the total of all claim costs reported.

6. Costs of the payments under this section shall not affect the experience rating of employers insured by the state fund.
