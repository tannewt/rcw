[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5886-S.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Rare diseases are those that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. There are over 7,000 rare diseases affecting approximately 30,000,000 Americans and 50 percent of those are children.

2. The exact cause for many rare diseases remains unknown. However, 80 percent of rare diseases are genetic in origin and can be linked to mutations in a single gene or in multiple genes which can be passed down from generation to generation.

3. A person suffering with a rare disease faces a wide range of challenges, including delays in obtaining a diagnosis, being misdiagnosed, shortages of medical specialists who can provide treatment for rare diseases, and a lack of therapies and medications that are used by doctors to treat rare diseases.
