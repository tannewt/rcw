# Senate Bill 5371

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5371.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature makes the following findings with respect to sweetened beverage consumption:

    a. Our nation and our state face a major public health crisis in the form of rising rates of chronic diseases associated with sweetened beverages, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease; adult and childhood obesity; and tooth decay and poor oral health;

    b. If trends are not reversed, it is predicted that close to half of the United States population is projected to have obesity by 2030;

    c. These diseases disproportionately affect people of color, including African Americans, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Latinxs, and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and people with low incomes, the same people who can be targets of ubiquitous sweetened beverage availability and marketing;

    d. The rate of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents, currently at 30 percent, has more than doubled since the late 1970s; more than half of all third graders (53 percent) and almost four in 10 kindergartners (38 percent) experience tooth decay in Washington state; and children from low-income households had at least 60 percent higher rates of tooth decay;

    e. Sweetened beverages are the largest single source of added sugars in the American diet and among the top sources of calories. Further, sources of liquid sugars may be uniquely harmful to health because of the way liquid sugars are metabolized;

    f. Consuming one sweetened beverage a day increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 26 percent;

    g. At least 682,000 adults (or one in eight) have diabetes, with a fourth not aware they have it. The average medical costs of people with diabetes is approaching $17,000 per person per year, about twice the cost for people without diabetes;

    h. Daily calorie intake among Americans increased by nearly 300 calories between the late 1970s and the early 2000s, and nearly half of that increase in extra calories came from sweetened beverages.Â There are large age, sex, race, education, and socioeconomic disparities in the consumption of sweetened beverages, with higher consumption among young adults, males, African Americans, Latinxs, and adults with lower education attainment;

    i. Imposing an excise tax on sweetened beverages has been shown to reduce sales of these beverages as demonstrated in places like Seattle, Washington; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Berkeley, California; and

    j. In Seattle, a $0.0175 per fluid ounce tax has increased prices of taxed beverages, decreased sales by 22 percent, and raised approximately $24 million in annual revenues, which have been invested in low-income communities and communities of color to increase access to healthy food, expand early childhood programs and subsidies for child care, and help high school students matriculate to college.

2. Based on the forgoing, it is the legislature's intent to impose an excise tax on sweetened beverages to:

    a. Lower the sales and consumption of sweetened beverages to reduce the rates and burden of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, tooth decay, and other adverse health conditions associated with the consumption of these beverages;

    b. Address the negative effects of sweetened beverages that disproportionately affect communities of color and low-income communities to address social determinants of health in disproportionately impacted communities burdened by negative health outcomes, with a particular focus on access to healthy foods, reducing food insecurity, and access to health care, as well as supporting community infrastructure and capacity; and

    c. Promote foundational public health services, as defined in RCW 43.70.515, and greater health equity in local communities throughout Washington.

## Section 3
1. Beginning October 1, 2021, there is a tax imposed upon every person engaging within this state in the business of distributing sweetened beverages. The tax shall be paid upon the first nonexempt distribution of a sweetened beverage drink product in the state. However, if a distributor or a retailer receives taxable products on which the tax has not been paid, the distributor or retailer shall be liable for the tax. The amount of tax with respect to such business is equal to the volume of sweetened beverages the distributor distributes in the state multiplied by the applicable tax rate in subsection (2) or (3) of this section.

2. For sweetened beverages that are produced from concentrates, the tax is calculated using the largest volume of beverage that would typically be produced by the amount of concentrate distributed based on the manufacturer's instructions or industry practice. Where a product is produced from more than one concentrate, the rate on each component must be calculated proportionately, so that the combined tax on the total yields a tax rate per fluid ounce of resulting beverage as provided under subsection (3) of this section.

3. [Empty]

    a. For all sweetened beverages, the tax rate is $0.0175 per fluid ounce of sweetened beverages the distributor distributes, as further adjusted under (b) of this subsection (3).

For the purposes of this subsection, "affiliated group" has the same meaning as provided in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1504(a), as amended as of the effective date of this section.
