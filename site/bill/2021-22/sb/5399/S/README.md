[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5399-S.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. Healthy Washingtonians contribute to the economic well-being of their families and communities, and access to appropriate health services and improved health outcomes allow all Washingtonian families to enjoy productive and satisfying lives;

    b. Washington and the United States are experiencing the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression, caused by a public health crisis;

    c. Skyrocketing unemployment rates due to COVID-19 have exposed the frailties and inequalities of the current health care system while causing unsustainable strain to the state's medicaid system;

    d. Thousands of union and nonunion workers are unemployed and without health insurance;

    e. Approximately 125,000 undocumented people live in the state with no access to health care during a global pandemic; and

    f. Multiple economic analyses show that a universal system is less expensive, more equitable, and will produce billions in savings per year.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends that by 2026, all residents of the state have comprehensive, equitable, and affordable health care coverage under a publicly financed and privately and publicly delivered health care system.

3. The resulting universal system should:

    a. Be built upon the success of existing publicly supported health insurance programs in the state;

    b. Streamline access to coverage, reduce fragmentation of health care financing across multiple public and private health insurance entities, reduce unnecessary administrative costs, and establish mechanisms to expeditiously link residents with their chosen providers; and

    c. Control health care spending so that the system is affordable to the state, employers, and to individuals over time.

4. The state, in collaboration with all communities, health plans, and providers, should take steps to improve health outcomes for all residents of the state.
