# Senate Bill 5834

## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that Washington state values the highest level of quality for the use of technology to improve services for the public, provide for accessibility and cost savings, and meet the public's needs. This includes the smart use of the cloud technology, applications, and mobile technology and the like that meet the highest standards of quality. The high quality use of technology requires rigorously following evidence-based best practices, supporting the state workforce with continuous learning, and responsibly managing the public's data, privacy, and security.

2. The legislature further finds that statewide data privacy and security policies have been in effect as recommendations for years, but the implementation of these policies has been sporadic, uncoordinated, and inconsistent. State agencies operate under a highly decentralized model and must design, develop, and implement their own programs in isolation and silos from others.

3. Voluntary compliance with these policies has shown to be insufficient. It is now important to require a more coordinated, standardized approach. Therefore, the legislature intends to elevate the quality of the state's use of technology by ensuring enterprise-level best practices, standards, and policies and to emphasize the expectation that agencies will be more rigorous about adopting and implementing such best practices, standards, and policies.
