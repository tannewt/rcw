## Section 5
1. This section is the tax preference performance statement for the tax preferences contained in sections 2 and 3, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (sections 2 and 3 of this act).

3. It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to extend the expiration date of these tax preferences in order to increase the ability of beneficiary facilities to provide at least 75 percent of their employees with medical and dental insurance and a retirement plan.

4. In order to obtain the data necessary to measure the effectiveness of these tax preferences in achieving the public policy objective described in subsection (3) of this section, the joint legislative audit and review committee may refer to:

    a. The annual survey that a taxpayer is required to file with the department of revenue per RCW 82.32.605; and
