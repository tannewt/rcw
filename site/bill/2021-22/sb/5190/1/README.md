This subsection does not apply to shared work employers under chapter 50.60 RCW;

    v. Continues to be employed on a regularly scheduled permanent part-time basis by a base year employer and who qualified for two consecutive unemployment claims where wages were attributable to at least one employer who employed the individual in both base years. Benefit charge relief ceases when the employment relationship between the employer requesting relief and the claimant is terminated. This subsection does not apply to shared work employers under chapter 50.60 RCW;

    vi.

The commissioner, upon investigation of the request, shall determine whether relief should be granted.

4. When a benefit claim becomes invalid due to an amendment or adjustment of a report where the employer failed to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, all benefits paid will be charged to the experience rating account of the contribution paying employer or employers that originally filed the incomplete or inaccurate report or reports. An employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefits paid to workers and who fails to report or inaccurately reported hours worked or remuneration paid, or both, shall reimburse the trust fund for all benefits paid that are based on the originally filed incomplete or inaccurate report or reports.

5. An employer's experience rating account may not be relieved of charges for a benefit payment and an employer who reimburses the trust fund for benefit payments may not be credited for a benefit payment if a benefit payment was made because the employer or employer's agent failed to respond timely or adequately to a written request of the department for information relating to the claim or claims without establishing good cause for the failure and the employer or employer's agent has a pattern of such failures. The commissioner has the authority to determine whether the employer has good cause under this subsection.

    a. For the purposes of this subsection, "adequately" means providing accurate information of sufficient quantity and quality that would allow a reasonable person to determine eligibility for benefits.

    b. [Empty]

(A) At least three times in the previous two years; or

(B) Twenty percent of the total current claims against the employer.

        ii. If an employer's agent is utilized, a pattern is established based on each individual client employer that the employer's agent represents.


## Section 5

    a. The exposure to the infectious or contagious disease which is the subject of the public health emergency occurred from other employment or nonemployment activities; or

    b. The employee was working from the employee's home, on leave from the employee's employment, or some combination thereof, for a period of 14 or more consecutive days immediately prior to the employee's injury, occupational disease, or period of incapacity resulted from exposure to the disease which is the subject of the public health emergency.

4. For purposes of RCW 51.32.090(7), the period of 14 consecutive calendar days shall be 10 consecutive calendar days.

If the opposing party is a state fund employer, the costs and fees are paid by the employer.

    b. When a determination involving the presumption established in this section is appealed to any court and the final decision allows the claim for benefits, the court shall order that all reasonable costs of appeal, including attorneys' fees and witness fees, be paid to the worker or the worker's beneficiary by the opposing party.

    c. When reasonable costs of the appeal must be paid by the department under this section in a state fund case, the costs shall be paid from the accident fund and charged to the costs of the claim.

        ii. The date the health care employee was quarantined by a medical provider or public health official; or

        iii. The date the health care employee received a positive test result confirming contraction of the infectious or contagious disease.

    c. "Health care facility" has the same meaning as in RCW 9A.50.010.
