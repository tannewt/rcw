[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5803-S2.pdf)
## Section 1
1. It is in the best interest of the state, our citizens, and our landscapes to identify the sources of wildland fires; identify and implement best practices to reduce the prevalence and intensity of those wildland fires; put those practices in place; and by putting those practices in place, reduce the risk of wildland fires and damage resulting from those fires.

2. The legislature finds that electric utilities are partners with relevant state agencies, emergency responders, and public and private entities in identifying best practices to reduce the risk of and prevent wildland fires. Many electric utilities have developed and are implementing wildfire mitigation plans. The legislature further finds that electric utilities should adopt and implement wildfire mitigation plans, and that electric utilities should be informed by recognized best practices, as applicable to their geography, terrain, vegetation, and other characteristics specific in their service area, for reducing wildland fire risk and reducing damage from wildland fires as may be ignited by electric utility equipment.

3. Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize the development of best practices guidelines and to require that electric utilities provide their wildfire mitigation plans to the state in order to promote public transparency and to obtain review of the plans for inclusion of applicable best practices guidelines.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [76.04](/rcw/76_forests_and_forest_products/76.04_forest_protection.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/76_forests_and_forest_products/76.04_forest_protection.md) for context.

1. The department shall contract with an independent consultant with experience in developing utility wildfire mitigation plans to recommend a format and a list of elements to be included in electric utility wildfire mitigation plans, including best practices guidance that may apply to each element as appropriate. In developing the format and list of elements, the department shall seek input from the utilities and transportation commission, the energy emergency management office of the department of commerce, the utility wildland fire prevention advisory committee, electric utilities, the state fire marshal, the governor's office of Indian affairs, and the public. By April 1, 2023, the department shall make public a recommended format and list of elements for electric utility wildfire mitigation plans.

2. The recommended elements must acknowledge that utilities serve areas that vary in topography, vegetation, population, and other characteristics, and that best practices guidelines within each element must recognize that a utility's wildfire mitigation plan will be designed to fit site-specific circumstances. The recommended elements must include, but are not limited to:

    a. Vegetation management along transmission and distribution lines and near associated equipment;

    b. Infrastructure inspection and maintenance repair activities, schedules, and recordkeeping;

    c. Modifications or upgrades to facilities and construction of new facilities to incorporate cost-effective measures to minimize fire risk;

    d. Preventative programs, including adoption of new technologies to harden utility infrastructure; and

    e. Operational procedures.

3. The recommended format and list of elements developed by the department must be forwarded to the utilities and transportation commission, the energy emergency management office of the department of commerce, and all electric utilities in Washington state for a review period of three months prior to finalizing the format and list of elements that utilities will use to adopt or update their electric utility wildfire mitigation plan.

4. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Consumer-owned utility" means a municipal electric utility, public utility district, irrigation district, cooperative, or mutual corporation association.

    b. "Electric utility" means: (i) An electrical company as defined in RCW 80.04.010 that is engaged in the business of distributing electricity to one or more electric customers in the state; or (ii) a consumer-owned utility that is engaged in the business of distributing electricity to one or more electric customers in the state.


## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [80.28](/rcw/80_public_utilities/80.28_gas_electrical_and_water_companies.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/80_public_utilities/80.28_gas_electrical_and_water_companies.md) for context.

By December 31, 2023, and every two years thereafter, each electrical company must review and revise, if appropriate, its wildfire mitigation plan. The plan should include a review of specific circumstances of that electrical company and incorporate as appropriate the recommendations developed pursuant to section 2 of this act. The electrical company must submit its plan to the commission and make the plan publicly available. Within six months of submission by the electrical company, the commission shall review the plan and confirm whether or not the plan contains the recommended elements. After the commission's review, the electrical company must provide a copy of the plan to the department of natural resources along with a list and description of wildland fires within its customer service area over the previous two years as reported by the department of natural resources. The plan must be posted as specified in section 6 of this act.


## Section 4
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [19.29A](/rcw/19_business_regulations—miscellaneous/19.029A_consumers_of_electricity.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/19_business_regulations—miscellaneous/19.029A_consumers_of_electricity.md) for context.

1. By December 31, 2023, and every two years thereafter, each consumer-owned utility must review and revise, if appropriate, its wildfire mitigation plan. The plan should include a review of specific circumstances of that utility and incorporate as appropriate the recommendations developed pursuant to section 2 of this act.

    a. The governing board of each consumer-owned utility shall review the plan and confirm whether the plan contains the recommended elements. Local fire districts must be provided the opportunity to review and provide feedback during this period. After the governing board's review, the utility must provide a copy to the department of natural resources, along with a list and description of wildland fires within its customer service area over the previous two years as reported by the department of natural resources. The plan must be posted as specified in section 6 of this act.

    b. Each consumer-owned utility must also provide its plan to the energy emergency management office of the department of commerce for review, which must review the plans and provide feedback within six months for consideration for inclusion in the next plan revision.

    c. By December 31, 2022, each utility must provide a copy of their most recent plan to the department of natural resources and it must be posted on a website.

    d. By December 31, 2023, the energy emergency management office will be available to provide technical assistance to consumer-owned utilities to include the best practices guidelines in their revision of plans.

2. Two or more abutting utilities may codevelop a wildfire mitigation plan. Wildfire mitigation plans that are codeveloped by more than one utility may identify areas of common implementation, including communication protocols, that will assist in implementing the recommended elements pursuant to section 2 of this act.

3. Nothing in this section prohibits a utility from reviewing or updating its wildfire mitigation plan more often than every two years or requires that the utility submit their plan beyond the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.
