## Section 11
1. The secretary of state shall certify to the proponents and to the legislature whether the proposed new county and the remaining parent county or counties, if any, will have the minimum populations required by the state Constitution and whether the petition has been signed by at least 50 percent of the registered voters in the combined portions of each parent county that is to be stricken to form the new county.

2. The secretary of state shall also notify the presiding judge of the division of the state court of appeals that contains the greatest portion of the population of the new county that a petition for the formation of a new county has been transmitted to the legislature and shall transmit with the notice a copy of the legal description of the proposed county.

3. The secretary of state shall also notify the director of the department of revenue that a petition for the formation of a new county has been transmitted to the legislature and shall transmit with the notice a copy of the legal description of the proposed county.

## Section 12
1. When a division of the court of appeals is notified under section 11 of this act that a new county has been proposed that strikes part of the territory of a parent county or counties, the presiding judge shall appoint a special master to gather facts, conduct hearings, review evidence, and make recommendations to the court regarding the division of assets and liabilities between the new county and the parent county or counties in accordance with sections 13 through 19 of this act. The principal proponent of the new county and the legislative authority of any parent county or counties from which territory is to be stricken are proper parties to this proceeding and may recommend individuals to serve as the special master.

2. If the petition for a new county proposes the consolidation of two or more existing counties where there is no remaining territory in any parent county or counties, the presiding judge may enter an order under section 17(1) of this act without appointing a special master.


## Section 13
1. The special master may employ appraisers, accountants, actuaries, engineers, attorneys, or other experts, and consult with state and local agencies, to assemble and evaluate evidence and exercise all other powers otherwise granted to the court that are necessary for the efficient and just resolution of issues.

2. The court of appeals may award payment of fees and costs to any special master and any experts that the special master is authorized to retain and may assess such fees and costs against the parent county and the new county in such proportions as it deems just.


## Section 14
Whenever a new county is created out of territory that was stricken from another county or counties, the new county is liable for an equitable proportion of the debts and liabilities of the parent county or counties and must receive an equitable proportion of the assets of the parent county or counties.


## Section 15
1. In apportioning the debts and liabilities under section 14 of this act, the court shall not charge either county with any share of debts or liabilities then existing incurred in the purchase of county property, or in the purchase or construction of public buildings then in use or under construction, or roads or bridges then in use or under construction, that are located within the other county except where the repayment of the debt or liability is being made or is to be made from bonds originally authorized by a vote of the qualified electors in the other county.

2. The remaining debts and liabilities of the parent county must be apportioned so that the new county is assigned an amount of these debts and liabilities that is in the same proportion as the assessed valuation of the new county, that was part of that parent county, is to the total assessed valuation in the parent county before the creation of the new county. The assessed valuations must be those used for taxes imposed in the year before the election was held authorizing the creation of the new county.

3. This section may not be construed to affect the rights of creditors.


## Section 16
1. In apportioning the assets of the parent county or counties, each parent county retains ownership of real property it owns that remains in its boundaries after the creation of the new county. At the effective date of the creation of the new county, the new county acquires ownership of real property that was owned by the parent county or counties that is located in the new county. No valuation of or compensation for real property is required.

2. All equipment owned by each parent county that is used in the construction or maintenance of roads or bridges must be apportioned based on total appraised value of the equipment between the new county and the parent county so that the new county receives a portion of this equipment that is in the same proportion as the number of miles of county roads in the new county, that were part of that parent county, is to the total number of miles of county roads in the parent county before the creation of the new county.

3. All other assets of each parent county, the apportionment of which is not otherwise provided for, must be apportioned between the parent county and the new county based on total appraised value of the assets so that the new county receives a portion of these assets that is in the same proportion as the assessed valuation of the new county, that was part of the parent county, is to the total assessed valuation of the parent county before the creation of the new county. The assessed valuations must be those used for taxes imposed in the year of the election authorizing creation of the new county.


## Section 17
1. Within six months after receiving notice under section 11(2) of this act, the court of appeals shall enter an order apportioning all debts, liabilities, and assets of the parent county or counties between the parent counties and new county and providing for the method of transfer or payment, subject to the creation of the new county under section 19 of this act. The order of the court of appeals is final.

2. RCW 2.06.040 applies to a proceeding under this section, except that a decision rendered under this section does not have precedential value and need not be published as an opinion of the court.


## Section 18
Within six months of the receipt of a notice under section 11 of this act, the director of the department of revenue, in conjunction with the department of community, trade, and economic development and the office of financial management, shall analyze and prepare a report on the impact of the creation of the new county on the revenues and expenditures of the parent county or counties.


## Section 19
1. If all the requirements of Article XI, section 3 of the state Constitution for the creation of a new county have been met, the legislature may, during the first regular session after certification under section 11(1) of this act, enact special legislation creating that county, subject to approval by a majority of the voters in the proposed new county at the next general election more than 120 days after the adjournment of the session at which the special legislation is adopted.

2. If the legislature does not enact special legislation creating the county under subsection (1) of this section, the question of the creation of that county must be referred to a vote of the registered voters residing in the proposed new county at the next general election more than 120 days after the adjournment of the session.


## Section 20
1. If the legislature provides for the creation of a new county under section 19 of this act by special legislation, that special legislation must include:

    a. A legal description of the proposed new county;

    b. The initial annual salaries of the elected officers of the new county;

    c. An initial county seat for the new county;

    d. Provision for the initial election of officers of the new county if those are different from sections 21 through 23 of this act;

    h. Any other measures the legislature finds appropriate to the efficient organization and operation of the new county government.

2. All counties must consist of a single contiguous area of land and water. If the legislature decides to modify the boundaries of the proposed new county, it shall consider the economic stability, the efficiency of administration, natural geographic barriers, transportation corridors, and the boundaries of existing communities and governmental units, as such factors affect the proposed new county and the remaining parent county or counties. The legislature may not make changes in the boundaries that would result in the creation of a new county that does not satisfy the requirements of Article XI, section 3 of the state Constitution.


## Section 21
1. If special legislation enacted under section 19(1) of this act does not provide otherwise or if the question of the formation of a new county is referred under section 19(2) of this act and if the new county includes part of the territory from one or more parent counties, that question must be submitted to the voters of the new county in substantially the following form:

"Shall the new county of (insert name of new county) be created and the assets and liabilities of (insert the name of the parent county or counties) be divided with this new county as provided in (cite the order of the court of appeals)? - yes or no?"

2. If the new county consolidates all of the territory of two or more parent counties, the question must be submitted to the voters of the new county in substantially the following form:

## Section 22
1. If special legislation enacted under section 19(1) of this act does not provide otherwise or if the question of the formation of a new county is referred under section 19(2) of this act, a primary must be held under RCW 29A.04.311 for the nomination of candidates for the various county elected offices, and elections for those offices must be held in conjunction with the state general election in that year. Except as provided in this section, nominations and elections must be held as provided by the general election laws for partisan county offices.

2. Declarations of candidacy for the initial terms of office for the elected county offices in the new county must be filed with the county auditor of the parent county if the new county is to be created out of territory from only one county and with the secretary of state if the new county is to be formed out of territory from more than one parent county.

3. Candidates for the office of county commissioner shall file for one of three separate county commissioner positions. If county commissioner districts were created by the special legislation, the filing officer shall designate one position for each district, and the voters in each district shall nominate the candidates for county commissioner for that district.

4. If any parent county does not provide a local voters' pamphlet for the primary or the general election under chapter 29A.32 RCW, the secretary of state shall provide a pamphlet for the jurisdiction of the proposed new county only.

5.

The local voters' pamphlet must include the legal description and map of the proposed new county, a summary of the allocation of assets, debts, and liabilities adopted by the court of appeals, and the report by the department of revenue about the revenue and expenditure impact of the formation of the new county on the parent county or counties.

7. The newly elected county officials shall assume office immediately upon the certification of the election with limited powers during the interim period as provided in this chapter and full powers after the expiration of the interim period.


## Section 23
If the legislature creates a new county under section 19(1) of this act or if a majority of the registered voters who reside within the boundaries of the proposed new county voting on the question vote in favor of creation of a new county under section 19 (1) or (2) of this act, the new county is established, with an interim organization period commencing on January 1st of the year after the session at which the special legislation was enacted or the election at which the voters approved the formation of the new county. The interim period expires on December 31st of the year in which it started.


## Section 24
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the terms of office for all of the initial county officials are from the date of the certification of their election until their successors are elected and qualified at the next general election that is two years before the year in which the governor is elected.

2. The commissioner or commissioners who receive the greatest number of votes for their respective positions at the general election provided for under section 22 of this act will receive the longer unexpired term or terms.

## Section 25
If the new county is created, the new county shall reimburse the parent county or counties for its share of the primary and election costs under RCW 29A.04.410.

## Section 26
Except as provided in this section, the creation of a new county may not affect the boundaries of a city, town, or special district of any kind.

1. Unless the initial board of county commissioners provides otherwise, a single road district must exist in the new county composed of all the unincorporated area within the new county. Territory that is stricken from a parent county to create a new county must also be stricken from the road district or districts of the parent county effective as of the final day of the interim period.

2. An area in a new county that was included in a county rural library district must remain part of that county rural library district. The trustees of such a library district must be appointed by joint action of the members of the county legislative authorities of the parent county or counties and the new county, with the vote on each appointment distributed among the members of the county legislative authorities so that the combined total vote of all the members of a single county legislative authority is in direct proportion to the percentage of population within the library district residing in that county and each member of that county legislative authority receiving an equal portion of that vote.

3. Effective on the first day after the interim period for the creation of a new county, a public transportation benefit area that includes territory located in both the remaining parent county and new county will have its boundaries reduced to eliminate any territory located in the new county.


## Section 27
The superior court and district court for the new county shall obtain jurisdiction over all new matters filed on or after the interim period expires, over which those courts otherwise have jurisdiction under the state Constitution and state law.

If original records, documents, or papers are not transferred, certified copies must be provided. The appropriate county officials of the parent county and the new county may agree to these transfers through electronic, mechanical, or other methods that adequately ensure the accuracy of the transferred information. The new county shall pay all costs incurred with regard to the transfer of records, documents, and papers.


## Section 29
During the interim period for a new county, the initial county officials have the following powers:

1. The initial board of county commissioners may adopt ordinances and adopt resolutions necessary to implement the general powers provided by this section.

## Section 31
All ordinances, rules, and regulations of a parent county that are in effect at the beginning of the interim period for a new county and that are adopted by the parent county during the interim period of a new county have their full force and effect within the portion of the parent county that is stricken to form the new county until the end of the interim period, unless repealed by the parent county before that date.


## Section 32
During the interim period for a new county, the parent county or counties remains responsible for providing all county services previously provided by that parent county in the portion of the parent county that is stricken to form a new county at the current level of service, unless otherwise agreed to between the parent county and the initial officers of the new county.

The budget may be amended periodically during the interim period to reflect actual revenues or expenditure requirements as they become known.


## Section 34
