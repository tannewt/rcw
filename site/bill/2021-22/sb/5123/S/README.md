# Substitute Senate Bill 5123 as Recommended by Human Services, Reentry & Rehabilitation

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5123-S.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that successful rehabilitation of youth adjudicated of sex offenses is the best path to reducing recidivism. The legislature recognizes the great and long-lasting harm caused to victims by problem sexual behaviors committed by youth and affirms the need to ensure that such behaviors are not repeated. The legislature finds that the consequences for youth adjudicated of sex offenses can last into adulthood and throughout their entire lives. The legislature finds that requiring youth to register as sex offenders is associated with mental health struggles, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, as well as the increased likelihood of becoming a target of sexual abuse by adults. The legislature finds that researchers from the Johns Hopkins University and other academic institutions found that registration and notification policies for minors failed to improve community safety and that evidence-based prevention and intervention policies would provide increased community safety.

The legislature finds that while adults can petition for relief of registration for offenses committed as minors, the legal process is overly cumbersome, expensive, and challenging to the point that many never request removal and remain on the registry their entire lives. The legislature finds that Black, Hispanic, and American Indian individuals are overly represented in the population of registered juvenile sex offenders in Washington state. The legislature declares that the response to sex offenses committed by youth should be developmentally appropriate and driven by research. The legislature therefore intends to increase community safety by reforming juvenile sex offender registration policy and related areas to redirect the focus toward practices that increase prevention and promote successful intervention strategies.

The weekly report shall be on a day specified by the county sheriff's office, and shall occur during normal business hours. The person must keep an accurate accounting of where he or she stays during the week and provide it to the county sheriff upon request. The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered in determining an offender's risk level and shall make the offender subject to disclosure of information to the public at large pursuant to RCW 4.24.550.

    c. If any person required to register pursuant to this section does not have a fixed residence, it is an affirmative defense to the charge of failure to register, that he or she provided written notice to the sheriff of the county where he or she last registered within three business days of ceasing to have a fixed residence and has subsequently complied with the requirements of subsection (4)(a)(vi) or (vii)  of this section **and this subsection (6)**. To prevail, the person must prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

No sex offender under the requirement to register under this section at the time of application shall be granted an order changing his or her name if the court finds that doing so will interfere with legitimate law enforcement interests, except that no order shall be denied when the name change is requested for religious or legitimate cultural reasons or in recognition of marriage or dissolution of marriage. A sex offender under the requirement to register under this section who receives an order changing his or her name shall submit a copy of the order to the county sheriff of the county of the person's residence and to the state patrol within three business days of the entry of the order.

8. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, nothing in this section shall impose any liability upon a peace officer, including a county sheriff, or law enforcement agency, for failing to release information authorized under this section.


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [9A.44.143](/rcw/09A_washington_criminal_code/9A.44_sex_offenses.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/09A_washington_criminal_code/9A.44_sex_offenses.md) for context.

1. An offender having a duty to register under RCW 9A.44.130 for a sex offense or kidnapping offense committed when the offender was a juvenile, and who has not been determined to be a sexually violent predator pursuant to chapter 71.09 RCW may petition the superior court to be relieved of that duty as provided in this section.

2.

For all  sex offenses or kidnapping offenses committed by a juvenile **as described in RCW 9A.44.130(1)(b)(ii)**, the court may relieve the petitioner of the duty to register if:

    a. At least **24** months have passed since the petitioner's adjudication and completion of any term of confinement for the offense giving rise to the duty to register and the petitioner has not been adjudicated or convicted of any additional sex offenses or kidnapping offenses within the **24** months before the petition;

    b. The petitioner has not been adjudicated or convicted of a violation of RCW 9A.44.132 (failure to register) during the **24** months prior to filing the petition; and

    c. The petitioner shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant removal from the central registry of sex offenders and kidnapping offenders.

3. A petition for relief from registration under this section shall be made to the court in which the petitioner was convicted of the offense that subjects him or her to the duty to register or, in the case of convictions in other states, a foreign country, or a federal or military court, to the court in the county in which the juvenile is registered at the time a petition is sought. The prosecuting attorney of the county shall be named and served as the respondent in any such petition. The prosecuting attorney must make reasonable efforts to notify the victim via the victim's choice of telephone, letter, or email, if known.

4. In determining whether the petitioner is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant removal from the central registry of sex offenders and kidnapping offenders, the following factors are provided as guidance to assist the court in making its determination, to the extent the factors are applicable considering the age and circumstances of the petitioner:

    a. The nature of the registrable offense committed including the number of victims and the length of the offense history;

    b. Any subsequent criminal history;

    c. The petitioner's compliance with supervision requirements;

    d. The length of time since the charged incident(s) occurred;

    e. Any input from community corrections officers, juvenile parole or probation officers, law enforcement, or treatment providers;

    f. Participation in sex offender treatment;

    g. Participation in other treatment and rehabilitative programs;

    h. The offender's stability in employment and housing;

    i. The offender's community and personal support system;

    j. Any risk assessments or evaluations prepared by a qualified professional;

    k. Any updated polygraph examination;

    l. Any input of the victim;

    m. Any other factors the court may consider relevant.

5. If a person is relieved of the duty to register pursuant to this section, the relief of registration does not constitute a certificate of rehabilitation, or the equivalent of a certificate of rehabilitation, for the purposes of restoration of firearm possession under RCW 9.41.040.

6. A juvenile prosecuted and convicted of a sex offense or kidnapping offense as an adult pursuant to RCW 13.40.110 or 13.04.030 may not petition to the superior court under this section and must follow the provisions of RCW 9A.44.142.

7. An adult prosecuted for an offense committed as a juvenile once the juvenile court has lost jurisdiction due to the passage of time between the date of the offense and the date of filing of charges may petition the superior court under the provisions of this section.


## Section 4
1. The legal obligation to register as a sex offender is extinguished when the sex offense was committed while under the age of 18 unless the duty to register was imposed:

    a. After an adjudication of a class A or class B sex offense committed when the person was age 16 or 17;

    b. After committing a sex offense and, on the offense date, had a prior conviction for a sex offense or had a deferred disposition for a sex offense as defined by RCW 9A.44.128;

    c. After a conviction of a sex offense in adult court pursuant to RCW 13.04.030(1)(e)(v);

    d. After an out-of-state, tribal, or federal conviction;

By August 1, 2021, the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs and the Washington state patrol shall remove all persons from the sex offender registry whose obligation to register is based on an offense committed while the person was under 18 years of age, unless the individual has a legal obligation to register under subsection (1) of this section.


## Section 5
By August 1, 2021, the Washington state patrol shall notify all persons whose obligation to register as a sex offender is extinguished by this act. For persons enrolled in school or higher education, the Washington state patrol shall provide similar notice to the school's or institution's designated recipient of records under RCW 9A.44.138.
