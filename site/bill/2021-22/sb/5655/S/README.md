# Substitute Senate Bill 5655 as Recommended by Subcommittee on Behavioral Health

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5655-S.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that over 30 percent of individuals currently at our state hospitals receiving forensic services are repeat patients. Many individuals in our state hospitals are individuals whose needs were not met when they were first referred for civil commitment. There is a subset of forensic patients who end up at a state hospital because their needs were not met in the civil system. Their unmet needs contribute to their involvement in the criminal justice system. As a state we need to provide an appropriate level of care to individuals when they are first identified as needing that care, instead of giving them the care they need through our forensic system. The consistent increase in numbers and acuity of forensic patients at our state hospitals is unacceptable, and solutions for this population have to be found.
