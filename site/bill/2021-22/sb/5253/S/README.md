# Substitute Senate Bill 5253 as Recommended by Agriculture, Water, Natural Resources & Parks

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5253-S.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The purpose of this act is to implement the recommendations of the pollinator health task force created by section 3, chapter 353, Laws of 2019, entitled "Recommendations of the Pollinator Health Task Force - for Pollinator Health in Washington" (November 2020).

2. The task force provided recommendations to help prioritize and enact policy changes for pollinators in Washington. The recommendations are organized under five broad categories: (a) Habitat; (b) pesticides; (c) education; (d) managed pollinators; and (e) research.

3. The task force met for the first time the same week that the Asian giant hornet was first discovered in Washington and the week after the Houdini fly was also reported for the first time in Washington. Asian giant hornets primarily hunt honey bees and destroy entire honey bee hives. The Houdini fly threatens native mason bee populations as well as managed mason bees. Washington is home to over 400 different species of native bees, 65 species of butterflies, as well as moths, wasps, beetles, flies, and hummingbirds. The loss of pollinators, managed and unmanaged, can lead to decreased yields of many fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Washington is currently the top producer in the United States of apples, sweet cherries, alfalfa, blueberries, and pears. In Washington state, honey bees and other pollinators are responsible for the production of tree fruits, small fruits, and other crops.

4. The legislature intends by this act to implement various recommendations from the pollinator health task force to protect and expand the habitat upon which pollinators depend, by providing technical and financial assistance to public and private landowners, and by coordinating with state agencies and local governments in promoting practices to ensure sustainable, healthy populations of managed and native pollinators.

    j. **Increase the availability of pollinator-related resources on the department's website, as practicable, and other state agencies' websites as appropriate;**

    k. **Develop guidelines for allowing beekeeping on state managed lands so that impacts to wild pollinators from honey bees may be minimized; and**

    l. **In consultation with the department of revenue, review the open space taxation act and provide recommendations to the legislature, in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, on options to include pollinator habitat in the current open space property tax classification.**

    d. Coordinate with pollinator health staff in the department and at Washington State University to conduct investigations and share annual findings from pesticide-related investigations with the pollinator health task force;

    e. Evaluate and, if necessary, update the pesticide civil penalty matrix related to pollinator death or damage due to the misuse of pesticides and ensure pollinator health protections are included when evaluating either pesticide investigation violations or penalties, or both;

    f. Evaluate the inclusion of pollinator protection course materials for pesticide license credit issuance. When possible, the department must provide credits for pesticide courses focused on pollinator protection measures.

3. By December 31, 2021, the department shall provide a report to the appropriate committees of the senate and house of representatives, in compliance with RCW 43.01.036, that includes recommendations for measures to mitigate the risks of harm to bees and other pollinators from the use of neonicotinoid pesticides. The department shall evaluate and incorporate the reviews scheduled for completion by the United States environmental protection agency during 2021, including recommended mitigation measures from that agency. The department shall also review neonicotinoid pesticide use restrictions and labeling requirements adopted in other states and include in the report any recommendations for adoption of similar requirements in this state.

For purposes of this section, "pollinator habitat" means an area of land that is or may be developed as habitat beneficial for the feeding, nesting, and reproduction of all pollinators, including honey bees. The department of agriculture, in consultation with the conservation commission, must develop landscape standards guidelines that include a list of native forage plants that are pollen-rich or nectar-rich and beneficial for all pollinators, including honey bees, and how pollinator plants and habitat should be designed and maintained after installation.

1. When prioritizing grant recipients, the commission, in consultation with the department of agriculture, Washington State University, and the United States department of agriculture natural resources conservation service, shall seek to maximize the benefits of the grant program by leveraging other state, nonstate, public, and private sources of money. The primary metrics used to rank grant applications must be made public by the commission.

2. The grant program must prioritize or weight projects based on consideration of the individual project's ability to:

    a. Increase the quantity of organic carbon in topsoil through practices including, but not limited to, cover cropping, no-till and minimum tillage conservation practices, crop rotations, manure application, biochar application, compost application, and changes in grazing management;

    b. Increase the quantity of organic carbon in aquatic soils;

    c. Intentionally integrate trees, shrubs, seaweed, or other vegetation into management of agricultural and aquacultural lands;

    d. Reduce or avoid carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in or from soils;

    e. Reduce nitrous oxide and methane emissions through changes to livestock or soil management; and

    f. Increase usage of precision agricultural practices.

5. [Empty]

    a. **Applicants that create or maintain pollinator habitat must receive an enhanced prioritization compared to other grant applications that perform similarly under the prioritization metrics developed by the commission.**

    b. **For the purposes of this subsection, "pollinator habitat" means an area of land that is or may be developed as habitat beneficial for the feeding, nesting, and reproduction of all pollinators, including honey bees, as determined by the department of agriculture.**

6. The commission shall downgrade a specific grant proposal within its prioritization metric if the proposal is expected to cause significant environmental damage to fish and wildlife habitat.


## Section 10
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [89.08](/rcw/89_reclamation_soil_conservation_and_land_settlement/89.08_conservation_districts.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/89_reclamation_soil_conservation_and_land_settlement/89.08_conservation_districts.md) for context.

1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the commission is authorized to develop an ongoing small grants program to provide funding to the conservation districts to educate residents and community groups in urban, suburban, and rural nonfarm areas about the value of habitat for both managed and native pollinators, and to provide the necessary technical and financial assistance and materials to create it.

2. Educational efforts should include the benefits of habitat diversity, especially pollen-rich and nectar-rich flowering forbs and shrubs. Preference for pollinator plants should be given to native plants or noninvasive, nonnative plants.

3. Planting projects should provide diverse native or nonnative, noninvasive plants of high quality for pollinator foraging, nesting, and overwintering, as determined by site suitability. Options may include, but are not limited to, bee or eco-lawns, flowering meadow gardens, xeriscaping, shrub plantings, tree plantings, rain gardens, riparian restoration, and other pollinator-friendly landscaping.

4. Criteria to rank applicants should include a detailed budget demonstrating funding needs, resource concerns addressed, value to at-risk native pollinators, multiple-use benefits of habitat, planned project longevity, and plans for long-term maintenance.
