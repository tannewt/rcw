# Senate Bill 5608

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5608.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that as the public enjoys open space and the natural beauty and recreational opportunities of this state, state lands and parks are a public good that should be available to all people, regardless of financial means.

2. The legislature also finds that while the economic circumstances resulting from the great recession brought about user-based, pay-to-play policies, such as the discover pass, for access to state-owned lands, this policy has resulted in decreased attendance and usage of our state parks and lands. A decline by an average of seven million visits per year as compared to the visitation rates of the two years prior to the enactment of the discover pass.

3. For most of Washington's history, public access to state parks and lands were free to all.  It was a policy that served our state well.  It is the intent of the legislature to return to that policy and repeal the requirement of having a discover pass to visit any state-owned land.  The lost revenues that would have otherwise come from discover pass sales are intended to be replaced with state general fund appropriation.
