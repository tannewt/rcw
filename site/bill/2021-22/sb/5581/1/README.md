3. **Beginning in the 2023-24 school year and each year thereafter, for any district where the reimbursement of costs from RCW 28A.160.160 exceeds 105 percent of the state average per student transported, the state auditor shall include in its regular audits of school districts a review of transportation costs to ensure they are necessary and reasonable costs that are:**

    a. **Attributable to requirements in approved individualized education programs for special education students;**

    b. **Attributable to the transportation of students who meet the definition of homeless where transportation to school is required by the McKinney-Vento act or other federal requirements; or**

Each district shall submit three times each year to the superintendent of public instruction during October, February, and May of each year a report containing the following:

1. [Empty]

    a. The number of eligible students transported to and from school as provided for in RCW 28A.160.150, along with identification of stop locations and school locations, and (b) the number of miles driven for pupil transportation services as authorized in RCW 28A.160.150 the previous school year;

**;**

4. **Beginning in the 2022-23 school year, information from subsection (2) of this section on a monthly basis.

By January 1, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must provide an analysis of school district transportation costs and allocations following the 2023-24 school year to the education and fiscal committees of the legislature. This analysis must include the mileage, ridership, and costs for each district, disaggregated by the following student demographic categories: (1) Students requiring special transportation due to a properly formed and approved individualized education program; (2) students requiring special transportation due to requirements of the McKinney-Vento act or other federal program; (3) students requiring special transportation due to a foster care placement out of their regular school district boundary; and (4) all other students transported to and from school. The legislature intends to use this data to inform their future discussions on revising the overall student transportation allocation model to a more transparent and predictable funding model.
