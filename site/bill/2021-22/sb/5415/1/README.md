    b. The council may commission its own independent consultant study to measure the consequences of the proposed energy facility on the environment or any matter that it deems essential to an adequate appraisal of the site. The council, after consultation with the utilities and transportation commission, shall provide an estimate of the cost of the study to the applicant and consider applicant comments.

    c. In addition to the deposit required under (a) of this subsection, applicants must reimburse the utilities and transportation commission, on behalf of the council, for actual expenditures that arise in considering the application, including the cost of any independent consultant study.

Each certificate holder shall pay to the utilities and transportation commission the actual costs incurred by the council for inspection and determination of compliance by the certificate holder with the terms of the certification relative to monitoring the effects of construction, operation, and site restoration of the facility.

    a. Each certificate holder shall, within thirty days of execution of the site certification agreement, **pay to the council for deposit into the energy facility site evaluation account** an amount up to fifty thousand dollars, or such greater amount as specified by the council after consultation with the certificate holder. The council and the utilities and transportation commission shall charge costs against the deposit if the certificate holder ceases operations and has not reimbursed the commission, on behalf of the council, for all actual expenditures incurred in conducting inspections and determining compliance with the terms of the certification.

    b. In addition to the deposit required under (a) of this subsection, certificate holders must reimburse the utilities and transportation commission, on behalf of the council, for actual expenditures that arise in administering this chapter and determining compliance.

The certificate holder shall pay the utilities and transportation commission the amount of the invoice by the due date.

3. If an applicant or certificate holder fails to provide the initial deposit, or if subsequently required payments are not received within thirty days following receipt of the invoice from the council, the council may (a) in the case of the applicant, suspend processing of the application until payment is received; or (b) in the case of a certificate holder, suspend the certification.

4. All payments required of the applicant or certificate holder under this section are to be made to the utilities and transportation commission who shall make payments as instructed by the council from the funds submitted.

    b. **Upon agreement with the potential applicant, the council may commission its own independent consultant to study matters relative to the potential project. The study must include, but need not be limited to, the preparation and analysis of environmental impact information for the potential project and any other matter the council and the potential applicant deem essential to an adequate appraisal of the potential project. In conducting the study, the council is authorized to cooperate and work jointly with the county or counties in which the potential project is located, any federal, state, local, or tribal governmental agency that might be requested to comment upon the potential project, and any municipal or public corporation having an interest in the matter. The full cost of the study must be paid by the potential applicant. However, costs exceeding a total of $10,000 are payable subject to the potential applicant giving prior approval to such an excess amount.**

3. **All payments required of the potential applicant under this section are to be made to the council for deposit into the energy facility site evaluation account for payment for the consultant. All such funds are subject to state auditing procedures. Any unexpended portions thereof must be returned to the potential applicant.**

4. **If a potential applicant subsequently submits a formal application for site certification for an energy facility at the site where a preliminary study was conducted, payments made under this section for that study may be considered as payment towards the application fee provided in RCW 80.50.071**.


## Section 10

All receipts from funds received by the council for fees received under this chapter must be deposited into the account. Expenditures from the account may be used for purposes set forth in this chapter. Only the chair of the council or the chair's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.

2. All funds currently credited to the council from receipt under this chapter as of the effective date of this section must be transferred to the energy facility site evaluation account.


## Section 11

1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the council must initiate, in coordination with its members, a least-conflict priority clean energy project siting program. This program must be carried out by Washington State University's energy program and must engage all relevant stakeholders to identify priority areas where there is the least amount of potential environmental and other conflict in the siting of covered clean energy projects and develop a map highlighting these areas. The program must also compile the latest information on opportunities for dual-use and colocation of clean energy projects with other land use values. The council may create different maps for divergent categories of clean energy projects to address multiple types of environmental and other conflicts for each category.

2. A project sited in an area designated under subsection (1) of this section does not receive a guarantee or assurance of certification under this chapter. Project proponents are not limited to proposing projects in identified least-conflict zones.

3. The council must update the study in subsection (1) of this section at least once every six years.


## Section 12
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [80.50](/rcw/80_public_utilities/80.50_energy_facilities—site_locations.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/80_public_utilities/80.50_energy_facilities—site_locations.md) for context.

1. Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the council must, in coordination with its members, develop a list of mitigation measures for significant likely environmental impacts of clean energy projects seeking certification under this chapter including, but not limited to, air quality impacts, impacts to land and aquatic habitats, wildlife, and other impacts that the council or its members identify as likely resulting from clean energy projects. The council shall identify a nonexhaustive list of potential impacts of clean energy projects to develop mitigations for, subject to available capacity and according to the council's best judgment of highest priority impacts to address. A mitigation measure may only be included in the list developed under this subsection if the measure is developed using best available science and has a high likelihood of mitigating the identified environmental impact. The council and its members should consider mitigation banks, siting and design best practices for clean energy projects, and other measures. Development of mitigation measures must include the involvement of local communities and other stakeholders.

2. An applicant may use mitigation measures developed under subsection (1) of this section and may propose other mitigation measures not identified under this subsection. The list of mitigation measures identified pursuant to subsection (1) of this section does not replace the requirement to evaluate applicability to any specific proposal under consideration and, if such measures are not applicable, to develop individualized site-specific mitigation evaluations and requirements for each project or facility.

3. The council may retain a consultant, contract with a state institution of higher education in Washington, delegate to an agency member, or otherwise retain outside assistance in completing the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.

4. The council must update the list developed under subsection (1) of this section at least once every six years.
