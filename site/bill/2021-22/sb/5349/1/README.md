[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5349.pdf)
## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [46.20.245](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.20_drivers_licenses—identicards.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.20_drivers_licenses—identicards.md) for context.

1. Whenever the department proposes to withhold the driving privilege of a person or disqualify a person from operating a commercial motor vehicle and this action is made mandatory by the provisions of this chapter or other law, the department must give notice to the person in writing by posting in the United States mail, appropriately addressed, postage prepaid, or by personal service. Notice by mail is given upon deposit in the United States mail. Notice given under this subsection must specify the date upon which the driving privilege is to be withheld which shall not be less than **90** days after the original notice is given. **Notice by mail must also include the following:**

    a. **An advisory of payment options including payment plan opportunities that are available;**

    b. **Community service opportunities that are available; and**

    c. **The department website address required under RCW 46.63.110.**

2. For persons subject to suspension, revocation, or denial of a driver's license who are eligible for full credit under RCW 46.61.5055(9)(b)(ii), the notice in subsection (1) of this section must also notify the person of the obligation to complete the requirements under RCW 46.20.311 and pay the probationary license fee under RCW 46.20.355 by the date specified in the notice in order to avoid license suspension.

3. Within **30** days after notice has been given to a person under subsection (1) of this section, the person may request in writing an administrative review before the department. If the request is mailed, it must be postmarked within **30** days after the date the department has given notice. If a person fails to request an administrative review within **30** days after the date the department gives notice, the person is considered to have defaulted and loses his or her right to an administrative review unless the department finds good cause for a request after the **30-day** period.

    a. An administrative review under this subsection shall consist solely of an internal review of documents and records submitted or available to the department, unless the person requests an interview before the department, in which case all or any part of the administrative review may, at the discretion of the department, be conducted by telephone or other electronic means.

    b. The only issues to be addressed in the administrative review are:

        i. Whether the records relied on by the department identify the correct person; and

        ii. Whether the information transmitted from the court or other reporting agency or entity regarding the person accurately describes the action taken by the court or other reporting agency or entity.

    c. For the purposes of this section, the notice received from a court or other reporting agency or entity, regardless of form or format, is prima facie evidence that the information from the court or other reporting agency or entity regarding the person is accurate. A person requesting administrative review has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the person is not subject to the withholding of the driving privilege.

    d. The action subject to the notification requirements of subsection (1) of this section shall be stayed during the administrative review process.

    e. Judicial review of a department order affirming the action subject to the notification requirements of subsection (1) of this section after an administrative review shall be available in the same manner as provided in RCW 46.20.308(8). The department shall certify its record to the court within **30** days after service upon the department of the petition for judicial review. The action subject to the notification requirements of subsection (1) of this section shall not automatically be stayed during the judicial review. If judicial relief is sought for a stay or other temporary remedy from the department's action, the court shall not grant relief unless the court finds that the appellant is likely to prevail in the appeal and that without a stay the appellant will suffer irreparable injury.

4. The department may adopt rules that are considered necessary or convenient by the department for purposes of administering this section, including, but not limited to, rules regarding expedited procedures for issuing orders and expedited notice procedures.

5. This section does not apply where an opportunity for an informal settlement, driver improvement interview, or formal hearing is otherwise provided by law or rule of the department.

3. No later than 30 days after the effective date of this section, the department shall create an online application process available for people who had their licenses suspended pursuant to RCW 46.20.289 prior to the effective date of section 5, chapter . . ., Laws of 2021 (section 5 of this act). This online application process shall allow a person to determine whether they are eligible to have their license reinstated and explain the process for reinstatement.

        i. **The** person must furnish proof of satisfactory progress in a required alcoholism or drug treatment program**;**

        ii. **The** person must furnish proof of financial responsibility for the future as provided by chapter 46.29 RCW**;**

    v. **The** person has committed an offense in another state that, if committed in this state, would not be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the person's driver's license**;**

    d. **If a person cited under (c) of this subsection appears in person before the court or violations bureau and provides written evidence that, after the time the person was cited, he or she has paid the underlying citation(s) that suspended his or her license, or has entered into a payment plan with the respective court or collection agency for the underlying citation(s), the citation shall be dismissed without cost and the person's license reinstated by the court or violations bureau, except that the court or violations bureau may assess court administrative costs of $50 and require payment of same as a condition of dismissal. In lieu of personal appearance, a person cited under (c) of this subsection may, before the date scheduled for the person's appearance before the court or violations bureau, submit by mail to the court or violations bureau written evidence that, after the time the person was cited, he or she has paid the underlying citation(s) that suspended his or her license or entered into a payment plan with the respective court or collection agency for the underlying citation(s), in which case the citation shall be dismissed without cost and the person's license reinstated by the court or violations bureau, except that the court or violations bureau may assess court administrative costs of $50 and require payment of same as a condition of dismissal.**

    e. **A person may apply to the sentencing court for a vacation of the offender's record of conviction for driving while license suspended or revoked in the third degree one year after successful completion of all conditions of judgment and sentencing including payment of financial obligations. If the court finds the offender is otherwise eligible, the court may clear the record of conviction: (i) By permitting the offender to withdraw the offender's plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty; or (ii) if the offender has been convicted after a plea of not guilty, by the court setting aside the verdict of guilty; and (iii) by the court dismissing the information or indictment against the offender. Once the court vacates a record of conviction under this section, the fact that the offender has been convicted of the offense shall not be included in the offender's criminal history for purposes of determining a sentence in any subsequent conviction, and the offender shall be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense. For all purposes, including responding to questions on employment applications, an offender whose conviction has been vacated may state that the offender has never been convicted of that crime.**

For the purposes of this subsection, a person is not considered to be eligible to reinstate his or her driver's license or driving privilege if the person is eligible to obtain an ignition interlock driver's license but did not obtain such a license.

2. Upon receiving a record of conviction of any person or upon receiving an order by any juvenile court or any duly authorized court officer of the conviction of any juvenile under this section, the department shall:

    a. For a conviction of driving while suspended or revoked in the first degree, as provided by subsection (1)(a) of this section, extend the period of administrative revocation imposed under chapter 46.65 RCW for an additional period of one year from and after the date the person would otherwise have been entitled to apply for a new license or have his or her driving privilege restored; or

    b. For a conviction of driving while suspended or revoked in the second degree, as provided by subsection (1)(b) of this section, not issue a new license or restore the driving privilege for an additional period of one year from and after the date the person would otherwise have been entitled to apply for a new license or have his or her driving privilege restored; or

    c. Not extend the period of suspension or revocation if the conviction was under subsection (1)(c) of this section. If the conviction was under subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section and the court recommends against the extension and the convicted person has obtained a valid driver's license, the period of suspension or revocation shall not be extended.
