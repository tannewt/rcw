## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [48.18](/rcw/48_insurance/48.018_the_insurance_contract.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/48_insurance/48.018_the_insurance_contract.md) for context.

1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person engaged in the business of insurance may not:

    a. Decline or limit coverage of a person under a policy or contract for life insurance, disability insurance, health insurance, or long-term care insurance solely due to the status of the person as a living organ donor;

    b. Preclude a person from donating all or part of an organ as a condition of receiving or continuing to receive a policy or contract for life insurance, disability insurance, health insurance, or long-term care insurance; or

    c. Otherwise discriminate in the offering, issuance, cancellation, amount of coverage, price, or any other condition of a policy or contract for life insurance, disability insurance, health insurance, or long-term care insurance for a person based solely and without any additional actuarial risks upon the status of the person as a living organ donor. This subsection does not prohibit fair discrimination on the basis of sex, or marital status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical handicap when bona fide statistical differences in risk or exposure have been substantiated.

2. The commissioner shall make educational materials available to the health plans and the public on the access of living organ donors to insurance.

3. The commissioner may adopt rules to implement this section.
