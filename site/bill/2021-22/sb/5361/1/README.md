Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, any offender sentenced for a violation of chapter 69.50 or 69.52 RCW that was committed prior to July 1, 2004, and who is serving a **current sentence under custody of the department of corrections** for that offense on June 11, 2020, is entitled to a resentencing hearing. The prosecuting attorney for the county in which any offender was sentenced and to whom this section applies must review the sentencing documents. If the offender is serving a term of incarceration for a violation of chapter 69.50 or 69.52 RCW that was committed prior to July 1, 2004, the prosecuting attorney shall, or the offender may, make a motion for relief from sentence to the original sentencing court.

The sentencing court shall grant the motion if it finds that the offender is serving a sentence for a violation of chapter 69.50 or 69.52 RCW that was committed prior to July 1, 2004, and shall immediately set an expedited date for resentencing. At resentencing, the court shall sentence the offender as if the offender had not previously been sentenced, provided the new sentence is **based on current sentencing guidelines pursuant to RCW 9.94A.517 and does not result in a sentence that is longer than the high end of the standard range on the current drug sentencing grid**.

3. An offender is not entitled to resentencing under this section if the offender has been convicted of a  serious **violent** offense **,** violent offense**, sex offense, or any crime involving a child**.
