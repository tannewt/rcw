## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

    a. Increasing broadband access to unserved areas of the state provides a public benefit to the citizens of Washington by allowing full participation in society and the modern economy, and enabling access to health care, education, and essential services, including public safety;

    b. Achieving affordable and quality broadband access for all Washingtonians will require sustained investment, research, local and community participation, and partnerships between private, public, and nonprofit entities;

    c. Providing for additional coordination across sectors to increase broadband access in unserved areas is in the best interest of the state; and

    d. Expanding broadband access, especially broadband conduit along roadways, provides commensurate benefits to the transportation system and motor vehicle users in terms of reducing congestion by allowing for more telework, and laying the foundation for a transportation system increasingly more reliant on autonomous vehicles.

2. Therefore, the legislature intends to expand broadband access to unserved areas throughout the state by increasing broadband infrastructure coordination opportunities, including a registry for broadband infrastructure projects, allowing installation of infrastructure during state road construction projects, and further mapping of broadband deployment locations.

## Section 8
> This section modifies existing section [47.04.047](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.04_general_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.04_general_provisions.md) for context.

Personal wireless service **and broadband service are** critical **parts** of the state's infrastructure. The rapid deployment of personal wireless service facilities **and broadband infrastructure are** critical to ensure public safety, network access, quality of service, and rural economic development.

It is the declared policy of this state to assure that the use of rights-of-way of state highways accommodate the deployment of personal wireless service facilities **and broadband infrastructure** consistent with highway safety and the preservation of the public investment in state highway facilities.


## Section 9
> This section modifies existing section [47.44.081](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.44_franchises_on_state_highways.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.44_franchises_on_state_highways.md) for context.

This chapter does not apply to leases issued for the deployment of personal wireless service facilities **or broadband infrastructure** as provided in RCW 47.04.045.


## Section 10
> This section modifies existing section [47.52.001](/rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.52_limited_access_facilities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/47_public_highways_and_transportation/47.52_limited_access_facilities.md) for context.

1. Unrestricted access to and from public highways has resulted in congestion and peril for the traveler. It has caused undue slowing of all traffic in many areas. The investment of the public in highway facilities has been impaired and highway facilities costing vast sums of money will have to be relocated and reconstructed.

2. Personal wireless service **and broadband service are** critical **parts** of the state's infrastructure. The rapid deployment of personal wireless service facilities **and broadband infrastructure are** critical to ensure public safety, network access, quality of service, and rural economic development.

3. It is, therefore, the declared policy of this state to limit access to the highway facilities of this state in the interest of highway safety and for the preservation of the investment of the public in such facilities, and to assure that the use of rights-of-way of limited access facilities accommodate the deployment of personal wireless service facilities **and broadband infrastructure** consistent with these interests.
