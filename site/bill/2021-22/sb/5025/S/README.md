# Substitute Senate Bill 5025 as Recommended by Law & Justice

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5025-S.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Strong consumer protection and antitrust penalties are critical to protecting consumers and ensuring a fair marketplace;

2. Strong penalties ensure accountability, deter violations, and ensure a level playing field for businesses;

3. Washington currently does not provide strong penalties for violations of the state's consumer protection act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of competition;

4. Washington's penalty for unfair or deceptive acts or practices has not kept pace with inflation, and has not increased since 1970;

5. Washington's penalty for unfair methods of competition has also not kept pace with inflation, and has not increased since 1983;

6. Consequently, Washington has one of the lowest consumer protection penalties in the United States;

7. Twenty-four state legislatures representing more than 200 million Americans have passed enhanced penalties for violations that target or impact certain vulnerable populations, but Washington does not have an enhanced penalty;

8. Many Washingtonians are hurting financially due to the impacts of the global pandemic;

9. Washington's weak penalties place Washington consumers at greater risk; and

10. Washingtonians deserve strong consumer protections to ensure entities that illegally, unfairly, and deceptively go after their hard-earned dollars are held accountable.
