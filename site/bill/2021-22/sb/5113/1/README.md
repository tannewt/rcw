## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [46.20.117](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.20_drivers_licenses—identicards.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.20_drivers_licenses—identicards.md) for context.

1. . The department shall issue an identicard, containing a picture, if the applicant:

    a. Does not hold a valid Washington driver's license;

    b. Proves his or her identity as required by RCW 46.20.035; and

    c. Pays the required fee. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the fee is fifty-four dollars, unless an applicant is:

        i. A recipient of continuing public assistance grants under Title 74 RCW, who is referred in writing by the secretary of social and health services;

        ii. Under the age of twenty-five and does not have a permanent residence address as determined by the department by rule; or

        iii. An individual who is scheduled to be released from an institution as defined in RCW 13.40.020, a community facility as defined in RCW 72.05.020, or other juvenile rehabilitation facility operated by the department of social and health services or the department of children, youth, and families; or an individual who has been released from such an institution or facility within thirty calendar days before the date of the application.

For those persons under (c)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the fee must be the actual cost of production of the identicard.

2. [Empty]

    a. . The identicard must:

        i. Be distinctly designed so that it will not be confused with the official driver's license; and

        ii. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, expire on the sixth anniversary of the applicant's birthdate after issuance.

    b. The identicard may include the person's status as a veteran, consistent with RCW 46.20.161(4).

3. . An application for identicard renewal may be submitted by means of:

    a. Personal appearance before the department; or

    b. Mail or electronic commerce.

An identicard may not be renewed by mail or by electronic commerce unless the renewal issued by the department includes a photograph of the identicard holder.

4. . The department may cancel an identicard if the holder of the identicard used the card or allowed others to use the card in violation of RCW 46.20.0921.

5. . The department may issue or renew an identicard for a period other than six years, or may extend by mail or electronic commerce an identicard that has already been issued, in order to evenly distribute, as nearly as possible, the yearly renewal rate of identicard holders. The fee for an identicard issued or renewed for a period other than six years, or that has been extended by mail or electronic commerce, is nine dollars for each year that the identicard is issued, renewed, or extended. The department may adopt any rules as are necessary to carry out this subsection.


## Section 4
> This section modifies existing section [46.20.120](/rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.20_drivers_licenses—identicards.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/46_motor_vehicles/46.20_drivers_licenses—identicards.md) for context.

An applicant for a new or renewed driver's license must successfully pass a driver licensing examination to qualify for a driver's license. The department must ensure that examinations are given at places and times reasonably available to the people of this state. If the department does not administer driver licensing examinations as a routine part of its licensing services within a department region because adequate testing sites are provided by driver training schools or school districts within that region, the department shall, at a minimum, administer driver licensing examinations by appointment to applicants eighteen years of age and older in at least one licensing office within that region.

1. .  The department may waive:

    a. All or any part of the examination of any person applying for the renewal of a driver's license unless the department determines that the applicant is not qualified to hold a driver's license under this title; or

    b. All or any part of the examination involving operating a motor vehicle if the applicant:

        i. Surrenders a valid driver's license issued by the person's previous home state; or

        ii. Provides for verification a valid driver's license issued by a foreign driver licensing jurisdiction with which the department has an informal agreement under RCW 46.20.125; and

        iii. Is otherwise qualified to be licensed.

2. .  Each applicant for a new license must pay an examination fee of thirty-five dollars.

    a. The examination fee is in addition to the fee charged for issuance of the license.

    b. "New license" means a license issued to a driver:

        i. Who has not been previously licensed in this state; or

        ii. Whose last previous Washington license has been expired for more than six years.

3. An application for driver's license renewal may be submitted by means of:

    a. Personal appearance before the department; or

    b. Mail or electronic commerce.

4. A person whose license expired or will expire while he or she is living outside the state, may:

    a. Apply to the department to extend the validity of his or her license for no more than twelve months. If the person establishes to the department's satisfaction that he or she is unable to return to Washington before the date his or her license expires, the department shall extend the person's license. The department may grant consecutive extensions, but in no event may the cumulative total of extensions exceed twelve months. An extension granted under this section does not change the expiration date of the license for purposes of RCW 46.20.181. The department shall charge a fee of five dollars for each license extension;

    b. Apply to the department to renew his or her license by mail or by electronic commerce . If the person establishes to the department's satisfaction that he or she is unable to return to Washington within twelve months of the date that his or her license expires, the department shall renew the person's license by mail or by electronic commerce.

5. If a qualified person submits an application for renewal under subsection (3)(b) or (4)(b) of this section, he or she is not required to pass an examination nor provide an updated photograph. A license renewed by mail or by electronic commerce that does not include a photograph of the licensee must be labeled "not valid for identification purposes."

6. Driver training schools licensed by the department under chapter 46.82 RCW may administer the portions of the driver licensing examination that test the applicant's knowledge of traffic laws and ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.

7. School districts that offer a traffic safety education program under chapter 28A.220 RCW may administer the portions of the driver licensing examination that test the applicant's knowledge of traffic laws and ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.
