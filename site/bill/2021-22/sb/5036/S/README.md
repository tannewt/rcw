The board may consider a incarcerated individual's failure to participate in an evaluation under this subsection in determining whether to release the incarcerated individual.

5. The board shall recommend the incarcerated individual be released under such affirmative and other conditions as the panel determines appropriate, unless the panel determines by a preponderance of the evidence that, despite such conditions, it is more likely than not that the incarcerated individual will commit new criminal law violations if released.

6. The board may take any of the following actions: Deny a petition without a hearing because the incarcerated individual does not meet the initial criteria for filing a petition; or conduct a hearing in accordance with RCW 9.94A.885 to consider additional information, and then deny the petition or recommend conditional commutation to the governor.

8. Further, the board shall consider a release plan presented by the incarcerated individual showing where the incarcerated individual will reside and how he or she will support himself or herself during the first year after his or her release. The department shall independently review the proposed release plan and make an independent evaluation to ensure the incarcerated individual is not released to an area where the victim resides or that impacts community safety.

9. If the board recommends commutation or denies the petition, it shall specify the reasons for the decision.

10. The conditions for conditional commutation may include: Partial confinement for up to six months, regular drug and/or alcohol testing, no violations of law, restrictions on travel, no contact with certain individuals or classes of individuals, restrictions on the type of employment and any other restrictions that the board determines to be reasonable and appropriate, or any other condition which provides for community protection from the released individual.

11. An incarcerated individual whose petition for conditional commutation is denied may file a new petition for conditional commutation three years from the date of denial or at an earlier date as may be set by the board.

12. The incarcerated individual does not have a right to appointed counsel. Both lawyers and nonlawyers may assist the incarcerated individual in the preparation of his or her petition and at the hearing.

## Section 8
1. Chapter 187, Laws of 2019 removed robbery in the second degree as a most serious offense in sentencing an individual as a persistent offender. At that time, the legislature declined to require resentencing of incarcerated individuals serving a life sentence as the result of a conviction for robbery in the second degree. The legislature recognizes the need to balance considerations that may have gone into the original charging decision and the inequities that may have resulted from including robbery in the second degree as a third strike offense.

2. In exercising its duties under RCW 9.94A.885 and section 7 of this act, the clemency and pardons board shall give priority consideration to incarcerated individuals who petition for conditional commutation and who have a current or past conviction for robbery in the second degree that was used as a basis for a finding that the incarcerated individual was a persistent offender.

3. This section expires December 31, 2024.
