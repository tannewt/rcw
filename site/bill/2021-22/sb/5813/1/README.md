# Senate Bill 5813

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5813.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that the people of Washington regard their privacy as a fundamental right and an essential element of their individual freedom. Washington's Constitution explicitly provides the right to privacy and fundamental privacy rights have long been and continue to be integral to protecting Washingtonians and to safeguarding our democratic republic.

2. Washington is a technology leader on a national and global level and recognizes its distinctive position in promoting the efficient balance of consumer privacy and economic benefits. Ongoing advances in technology have produced an exponential growth in the volume and variety of personal data being generated, collected, stored, and analyzed, which presents both promise and potential peril. The ability to harness and use data in positive ways is driving innovation and brings beneficial technologies to society. However, it has also created risks to privacy and freedom. The unregulated and unauthorized use and disclosure of personal information and loss of privacy can have devastating impacts, ranging from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs, to personal time and finances, to destruction of property, harassment, reputational damage, emotional distress, and physical harm.

3. From a very young age, today's youth spend an extensive amount of their time engaged in online activities and services for various purposes including education, socializing, shopping, gaming, and entertainment. Children and adolescents navigate various websites and online applications without fully understanding what personal data is being collected about them, how this data can impact them in the future, or how to ensure the privacy and security of their personal data. The personal data of this vulnerable population requires and deserves additional protections, which includes parental or guardian oversight, adolescent control of data, and the ability for adults to delete their personal data from when they were a child or adolescent.

4. There are many different types of businesses that collect data about and from consumers. However, a data broker is in the business of combining and selling data about consumers with whom it does not have a direct relationship. Data brokers often collect data from multiple sources, all while consumers may not know that the data broker exists. While data brokers offer many benefits in a modern economy, such as providing information that is critical to services including credit reporting, background checks, risk mitigation, fraud detection, and people search, there are also risks associated with the prevalent combination and sale of data about consumers. These risks may relate to a consumer's ability to know and control information held and sold about them and risks due to the unauthorized or harmful acquisition and use of consumer information.

5. In order to provide consumers with more control over how their personal data is used by businesses, several states have enacted laws that provide consumers with the right to opt out of targeted advertising and the sale of their data. In an effort to make the opt out right more workable for consumers, such laws often authorize consumers to request to opt out through do not track mechanisms and require businesses to recognize these requests. However, technical specifications needed to implement such a requirement are in the early stages of development and it is worth taking a measured, thoughtful approach.

6. With this act, the legislature intends to: Strengthen and expand existing privacy protections for Washington residents by establishing additional protections and controls for the personal data of children and adolescents; provide consumers transparency about data brokers; require data brokers to allow consumers to access, delete, and correct their data; and engage in deliberate, inclusive rule making to determine appropriate and reasonable technical specifications for honoring consumer requests to opt out of certain processing. In addition, this act imposes affirmative obligations upon companies to safeguard personal data and provide clear, understandable, and transparent information to consumers about how their personal data is used.

6. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way the rights of a child, a parent or legal guardian, an adolescent, or an adult under this chapter is deemed contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable.


## Section 107
1. A business may not process the personal data of a known adolescent or a known child in any way that: (i) Unfairly disadvantages the adolescent or the child considering the benefits of the processing, the risk of harm to the adolescent or the child, and the ability of the business to avoid any potential harm or detriment to the adolescent or the child; (ii) results in reasonably foreseeable harm to a known adolescent or known child; or (iii) would be unexpected and highly offensive to a reasonable person.

    a. The categories of personal data relating to children or adolescents that are processed by the business;

    b. The purposes for which the categories of personal data are processed;

Except as provided in this chapter, a business may not process the personal data of a child or an adolescent for purposes that are not reasonably necessary to, or compatible with, the specified purposes for which the personal data is processed unless the business obtains the necessary consents as described in section 102 of this act.

6. A business may not retain personal data of a child or adolescent for longer than is necessary to fulfill a transaction or provide a service requested by the child or adolescent or such other purposes as permitted by this chapter.

9. A business may not engage in abusive trade practices concerning the processing of the personal data of a known adolescent or a known child, meaning practices that: (a) Materially interfere with the ability of adolescents, children, parents, or lawful guardians to understand a term or condition of a product or service involving the processing of personal data; or (b) unreasonably take advantage of or unreasonably fail to account for or remedy: (i) A lack of understanding by an adolescent, a child, or a parent or lawful guardian of the material risks, costs, or conditions of a product or service involving the processing of personal data; (ii) the inability of an adolescent, a child, or a parent or lawful guardian to protect the interests of the adolescent, child, or parent or lawful guardian in selecting or using a product or service involving the processing of personal data; or (iii) the reasonable reliance by an adolescent, a child, or a parent or lawful guardian on a business to act in the best interests of the adolescent or child.

10. A business may not discriminate against a child, a parent or legal guardian of a child, an adolescent, or an adult for exercising any of the rights contained in this chapter, including denying them goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, and providing a different level of quality of goods and services. This subsection does not prohibit a business from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a parent or legal guardian of a child or an adolescent, including offering goods or services for no fee, if: (a) The offering is in connection with voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program; (b) the use and any dissemination of personal data as part of the program is clearly and conspicuously disclosed, separate and apart from any other terms applicable to the program, to the parent or legal guardian of a child or the adolescent; (c) the parent or legal guardian of a child or the adolescent provides consent to such use and disclosures; and (d) any third party who receives personal data as part of the program uses the personal data only for purposes of facilitating the benefits to which the parent or legal guardian of a child or the adolescent is entitled and does not retain or otherwise use or disclose the personal data for any other purpose.


## Section 108
1. A business must conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of its processing activities involving the personal data of children or adolescents. Such a data protection assessment must take into account the type of personal data to be processed by the business, including the extent to which the personal data is sensitive data, and the context in which the personal data is to be processed.

2. A data protection assessment conducted under subsection (1) of this section must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow directly and indirectly from the processing to the business, the adolescent or child, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the adolescent, child, or parent or legal guardian of the child associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the business to reduce such risks. The use of deidentified data and the reasonable expectations of adolescents, children, and parents or legal guardians, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the business and the adolescent, child, or parent or legal guardian must be factored into this assessment by the business.

3. The attorney general may request, in writing, that a business disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general. The business must make a data protection assessment available to the attorney general upon such a request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessments for compliance with the responsibilities contained in this chapter and, if it serves a civil investigative demand, with RCW 19.86.110. Data protection assessments are confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under chapter 42.56 RCW. The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general under this subsection does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment unless otherwise subject to case law regarding the applicability of attorney-client privilege or work product protections.

4. A data protection assessment conducted by a business for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations may qualify under this section if it has a similar scope and effect.


## Section 109
1. The obligations imposed on businesses or service providers under this chapter do not restrict a business's or service provider's ability to:

    a. Comply with federal, state, or local law; or

    b. Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life of a natural person, and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis.

2. A business is not required to comply with a request to delete personal information pursuant to sections 103(3), 104(3) or 105 of this act if it is necessary for the business to maintain the personal data to:

    a. Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the business or service provider reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local law;

    b. Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims;

    c. [Empty]

        i. Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity; (ii) preserve the integrity or security of systems; or (iii) investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any such an action;

    d. Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or

    e. Perform solely internal operations that are reasonably aligned or compatible with the expectations of the parent or legal guardian of a child or the adolescent, as applicable, based upon the existing relationship that the business has with the parent or legal guardian of a child or the adolescent.

3. The obligation to delete personal data pursuant to sections 103(3), 104(3) or 105 of this act does not apply to publicly available information.

4. Obligations imposed on a business under this chapter may not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising the right of free speech pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

5. If a business processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the business bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in this subsection and subsection (6) of this section.

6. Personal data that is processed by a business pursuant to this section must not be processed for any purpose other than those expressly listed in this section.

7. Personal data that is processed by a business pursuant to this section may be processed solely to the extent that the processing is: (a) Necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; (b) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purpose or purposes listed in this section; and (c) insofar as possible, taking into account the nature and purpose of processing the personal data, subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal information, and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to individuals.


## Section 110
1. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, nothing in this chapter creates an independent cause of action, except for the actions brought by the attorney general to enforce this chapter. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, no person, except for the attorney general, may enforce the rights and protections created by this chapter in any action. However, nothing in this chapter limits any other independent causes of action enjoyed by any person, including any constitutional, statutory, administrative, or common law rights or causes of action. The rights and protections in this chapter are not exclusive, and to the extent that a person has the rights and protections in this chapter because of another law other than this chapter, the person continues to have those rights and protections notwithstanding the existence of this chapter.

2. An adolescent, an adult, or a parent or legal guardian of a child alleging a violation of sections 103, 104, and 105 of this act may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. Remedies are limited to appropriate injunctive relief necessary and proportionate to remedy the violation against the aggrieved adolescent, adult, or child. The court shall also award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs directly incurred in pursuit of claims under this chapter to any prevailing plaintiff.


## Section 111
1. Except as provided in section 110 of this act, this chapter may be enforced solely by the attorney general under the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

2. In actions brought by the attorney general, the legislature finds: (a) The practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW; and (b) a violation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business, is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce, and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

3. The legislative declarations in this section do not apply to any claim or action by any party other than the attorney general alleging that conduct regulated by this chapter violates chapter 19.86 RCW, and this chapter does not incorporate RCW 19.86.093.

4. In the event of a business's or service provider's violation under this chapter, prior to filing a complaint, the attorney general must provide the business or service provider with a warning letter identifying the specific provisions of this chapter the attorney general alleges have been or are being violated. If, after 30 days of issuance of the warning letter, the attorney general believes the business or service provider has failed to cure any alleged violation, the attorney general may bring an action against the controller or processor as provided under this chapter.

5. In determining a civil penalty under this chapter, the court must consider, as mitigating factors, a business's or service provider's good faith efforts to comply with the requirements of this chapter and any actions to cure or remedy the violations before an action is filed.

6. All receipts from the imposition of civil penalties under this chapter must be deposited into the consumer privacy account created in section 112 of this act.


## Section 112
The consumer privacy account is created in the state treasury. All receipts from the imposition of civil penalties under this chapter must be deposited into the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Moneys in the account may only be used for the purposes of recovery of costs and attorneys' fees accrued by the attorney general in enforcing this chapter and for the office of privacy and data protection as created in RCW 43.105.369. Moneys may not be used to supplant general fund appropriations to either agency.


## Section 113
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [42.56](/rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.56_public_records_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/42_public_officers_and_agencies/42.56_public_records_act.md) for context.

A data protection assessment submitted by a business to the attorney general in accordance with the requirements under section 108 of this act is exempt from disclosure under this chapter.
