## Section 1
The legislature intends to improve the education of children by enabling parents to independently determine which school best meets their child's educational needs and empowering parents to be able to send their child to their school of choice. The legislature further intends to support parental school choice by making state-funded K-12 education vouchers a necessary component to fulfill the state's constitutional obligation under Article IX to amply fund a program of basic education.


## Section 2
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Eligible child" means a person eligible to attend grades kindergarten through twelve in Washington state.

2. "Parent" means a parent, guardian, or other person or entity having legal custody of an eligible child.

3. "Private school" means an approved private school under chapter 28A.195 RCW.

4. "Public school" means a public school as defined in RCW 28A.150.010.

5. "Voucher" or "K-12 education voucher" is a payment credit provided to an eligible child through their parent, which may be redeemed at a designated voucher-redeeming school. A voucher is basic education funding under Article IX of the state Constitution.

6. "Voucher-redeeming school" means any public school and any approved private school, located within Washington state.


## Section 3
1. Beginning with the 2021-22 school year, the state shall annually provide a K-12 education voucher to every eligible child whose parent applies for a K-12 education voucher. Vouchers may be redeemed at any voucher-redeeming school.

2. The K-12 education voucher value for each eligible child must be not less than nine thousand dollars beginning in the 2021-22 school year and annually adjusted thereafter for inflation as specified in the omnibus appropriations act.

3. To obtain a K-12 education voucher for an eligible child, a parent must apply to the office of the superintendent of public instruction by August 1st of each year.

4. K-12 education vouchers are not taxable income of the child or the parent of the child receiving the K-12 education voucher. The parent of the child receiving a K-12 education voucher is free to choose any voucher-redeeming school, and this selection is not a decision or act of the state or any of its subdivisions.

5. After the parent designates the enrolling school to receive the K-12 education voucher funds, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall disburse the K-12 education voucher funds in equal monthly amounts directly to the school for the education of the child for which the K-12 education voucher is provided.

6. Expenditures for K-12 education vouchers issued under this chapter count toward the minimum state funding requirements for basic education established under Article IX of the Washington state Constitution.

7. For fiscal purposes, a child who receives a K-12 education voucher is a resident of the school district in which the child is enrolled.
