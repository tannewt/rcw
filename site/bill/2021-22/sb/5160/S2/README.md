## Section 1
Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature with this act to increase tenant protections during the public health emergency, provide legal representation for qualifying tenants in eviction cases, establish an eviction resolution pilot program to address nonpayment of rent eviction cases before any court filing, and ensure tenants and landlords have adequate opportunities to access state and local rental assistance programs to reimburse landlords for unpaid rent and preserve tenancies.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [59.18](/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.18_residential_landlord-tenant_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.18_residential_landlord-tenant_act.md) for context.

The definitions in this section apply to sections 3 and 4 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Dwelling unit" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 59.18.030, and includes a manufactured/mobile home or a mobile home lot as defined in RCW 59.20.030.

2. "Eviction moratorium" refers to the governor of the state of Washington's proclamation 20.19-5, proclaiming a moratorium on certain evictions for all counties throughout Washington state on December 31, 2020, and any subsequent orders extending or amending such proclamation until it expires or is terminated by the governor of the state of Washington.

3. "Landlord" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 59.18.030 and 59.20.030.

4. "Public health emergency" refers to the governor of the state of Washington's proclamation 20-05, proclaiming a state of emergency for all counties throughout Washington state on February 29, 2020, and any subsequent orders extending or amending such proclamation due to COVID-19 until the proclamation expires or is terminated by the governor of the state of Washington.

5. "Rent" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 59.18.030.

"Tenant" does not include occupants of homeless mitigation sites or a person entering onto land without permission of the landowner or lessor. For purposes of this subsection, any local government provision of solid waste or hygiene services to unsanctioned encampments does not constitute permission to occupy land.


## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [59.18](/rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.18_residential_landlord-tenant_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/59_landlord_and_tenant/59.18_residential_landlord-tenant_act.md) for context.

1. For rent that accrued between March 1, 2020, and the governor's eviction moratorium expiration date, a tenant's nonpayment of rent must not be a factor in any housing decision affecting a tenant's right or ability to occupy a rental dwelling unit. This subsection applies equally to tenants and prospective tenants.

2. A landlord may not charge or impose any late fees or other charges against any tenant for the nonpayment of rent that became due during the public health emergency.

3. [Empty]

    a. A landlord may not deny, discourage application for, or otherwise make unavailable any rental dwelling unit based on a tenant's or prospective tenant's medical history including, but not limited to, the tenant's or prospective tenant's prior or current exposure or infection to the COVID-19 virus.

4. A landlord in violation of this section is liable in a civil action for up to four and one-half times the monthly rent of the real property at issue, as well as court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.

If a tenant fails to accept the terms of a reasonable repayment plan within 14 days of the landlord's offer or defaults on any rent owed under a repayment plan, the landlord may apply for reimbursement from the landlord mitigation program as authorized under RCW 43.31.605(1)(d) or proceed with an unlawful detainer action as set forth in RCW 59.12.030(3) but subject to any requirements under the eviction resolution pilot program established under section 7 of this act.
