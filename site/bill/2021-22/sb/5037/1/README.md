# Senate Bill 5037

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5037.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature acknowledges that school districts and charter schools are faced with challenging decisions regarding how to operate their schools during COVID-19 and whether they should offer in-person learning, distance learning, or hybrid or rotating schedules. The legislature recognizes that full-time, distance learning presents many challenges and hardships to students and families.

2. The legislature finds that the best metric for determining prevalence of COVID-19 in a community is tied to the positivity standard within a county. This metric does not punish communities for testing more, as does a metric tied to cases per population. Further, the positivity metrics are linked to the world health organization metrics.

3. The legislature intends to establish clear school opening metrics based on the positivity standard within counties, so these decisions are transparent and uniform throughout the state of Washington.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [28A.630](/rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.630_temporary_provisions—special_projects.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/28A_common_school_provisions/28A.630_temporary_provisions—special_projects.md) for context.

1. When the governor proclaims a state of emergency under chapter 43.06 RCW in response to COVID-19, school districts must use the metrics in this section to determine the education modality for the schools by county.

    a. School districts in counties below a five percent positivity standard must offer in-person learning to all students. To move out of this category, counties must be above a five percent positivity standard for two weeks in a row.

    b. School districts in counties above a five percent positivity standard may choose the education modality for their students. To move out of this category, counties must be below a five percent positivity standard for two weeks in a row.

2. If a school district is located in more than one county, a school district must determine the average positivity standard of all the counties in which it is located to determine the education modality under subsection (1) of this section.

3. If there is an outbreak of COVID-19 at a particular school, a school district and local health officer, in accordance with other state laws, must take all appropriate actions deemed necessary to control or eliminate the spread of COVID-19 within the affected school including:

    a. Closing part or all of the affected school;

    b. Canceling activities or functions at the affected school; and

    c. Excluding from the affected school any students, staff, and volunteers who are infectious, or exposed and susceptible to the disease.

4. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Education modality" means the type of setting to deliver education services including, but not limited to, in-person learning, distance learning, and hybrid or rotating schedules with in-person learning and distance learning.

    b. "Outbreak" means the school meets the following criteria: (i) Two or more cases of laboratory positive COVID-19 among students or staff; (ii) the cases have symptom onsets within a fourteen-day period of each other; (iii) plausible epidemiological-linkage in the school; and (iv) no other known epidemiological-linkage outside of the school.

    c. "Positivity standard" means the percent of individuals testing positive for COVID-19. It must be calculated by comparing the number of individuals testing positive over the past week to the total number of tests during that week.

5. This section is a state health requirement under RCW 28A.710.040 and applies to charter schools established in accordance with chapter 28A.710 RCW.


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [43.06.220](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.006_governor.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.006_governor.md) for context.

1. The governor after proclaiming a state of emergency and prior to terminating such, may, in the area described by the proclamation issue an order prohibiting:

    a. Any person being on the public streets, or in the public parks, or at any other public place during the hours declared by the governor to be a period of curfew;

    b. Any number of persons, as designated by the governor, from assembling or gathering on the public streets, parks, or other open areas of this state, either public or private;

    f. Permits for industrial, business, or medical uses of alcohol; and

    g. Such other statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to legislative leadership and impacted local governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g).

3. In imposing the restrictions provided for by RCW 43.06.010, and 43.06.200 through 43.06.270, the governor may impose them for such times, upon such conditions, with such exceptions and in such areas of this state he or she from time to time deems necessary.

4. No order or orders concerning waiver or suspension of statutory obligations or limitations under subsection (2) of this section may continue for longer than thirty days unless extended by the legislature through concurrent resolution. If the legislature is not in session, the waiver or suspension of statutory obligations or limitations may be extended in writing by the leadership of the senate and the house of representatives until the legislature can extend the waiver or suspension by concurrent resolution. For purposes of this section, "leadership of the senate and the house of representatives" means the majority and minority leaders of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives.

5. **No order or orders issued under this section may supersede, waive, or suspend statutory and regulatory obligations or limitations concerning education modalities during COVID-19 set forth in section 2 of this act.**

6. Any person willfully violating any provision of an order issued by the governor under this section is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
