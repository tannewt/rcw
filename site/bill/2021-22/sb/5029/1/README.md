# Senate Bill 5029

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5029.pdf)
## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [82.60.010](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.60_tax_deferrals_for_investment_projects_in_rural_counties.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.60_tax_deferrals_for_investment_projects_in_rural_counties.md) for context.

The legislature finds that there are **counties** in the state that **experience chronically high levels of unemployment and that state policies are necessary to promote economic stimulation and new employment opportunities in these counties**. The legislature further finds that **firms participating in a tax deferral program in high unemployment counties created more jobs and experienced higher levels of income growth than firms that did not participate in the deferral**. For these reasons, the legislature reestablishes a tax deferral program to be effective solely in  counties **experiencing high levels of unemployment**. The legislature declares that this limited program serves the vital public purpose of creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty in  counties **experiencing levels of unemployment that are higher than those** of the state.


## Section 2
> This section modifies existing section [82.60.020](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.60_tax_deferrals_for_investment_projects_in_rural_counties.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.60_tax_deferrals_for_investment_projects_in_rural_counties.md) for context.

"Eligible investment project" does not include any portion of an investment project undertaken by a light and power business as defined in RCW 82.16.010(4), other than that portion of a cogeneration project that is used to generate power for consumption within the manufacturing site of which the cogeneration project is an integral part, or investment projects that have already received deferrals under this chapter.

5. "Initiation of construction" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.63.010.

6. "Investment project" means an investment in qualified buildings or qualified machinery and equipment, including labor and services rendered in the planning, installation, and construction of the project.

13. "Qualifying county" means a county that has an unemployment rate, as determined by the employment security department, which is at least **20** percent above the state average for the three calendar years immediately preceding the year in which the list of qualifying counties is established or updated, as the case may be, as provided in RCW 82.60.120.

## Section 6
> This section modifies existing section [82.60.049](/rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.60_tax_deferrals_for_investment_projects_in_rural_counties.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/82_excise_taxes/82.60_tax_deferrals_for_investment_projects_in_rural_counties.md) for context.

1. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Eligible area" also means a designated community empowerment zone approved under RCW 43.31C.020.

    b. "Eligible investment project" also means an investment project in an eligible area as defined in this section.

2. In addition to the provisions of **section 4 of this act**, the department shall issue a sales and use tax deferral certificate for state and local sales and use taxes due under chapters 82.08, 82.12, and 82.14 RCW, on each eligible investment project that is located in an eligible area, if the applicant establishes that at the time the project is operationally complete:

    a. The applicant will hire at least one qualified employment position for each **$750,000** of investment for which a deferral is requested; and

    b. The positions will be filled by persons who at the time of hire are residents of the community empowerment zone. As used in this subsection, "resident" means the person makes his or her home in the community empowerment zone or the county in which the zone is located. A mailing address alone is insufficient to establish that a person is a resident for the purposes of this section. The persons must be hired after the date the application is filed with the department.

3. All other provisions and eligibility requirements of this chapter apply to applicants eligible under this section.

4. The qualified employment position must be filled by the end of the calendar year following the year in which the project is certified as operationally complete. If a person does not meet the requirements for qualified employment positions by the end of the second calendar year following the year in which the project is certified as operationally complete, all deferred taxes are immediately due.

If the economic benefits of the deferral are passed to a lessee as provided in RCW 82.60.025, the lessee must file a complete annual tax performance report, and the applicant is not required to file a complete annual tax performance report.

    b. The **joint legislative audit and review committee, as part of its tax preference review process under chapter 43.136 RCW,** must use the information reported on the annual tax performance report required by this section to study the tax deferral program authorized under this chapter. The **committee** must report to the legislature by December 1, **2028**. The report must measure the effect of the program on job creation, the number of jobs created for residents of eligible areas, company growth, and such other factors as the **committee** selects.

2. (a) **Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, taxes deferred under this chapter need not be repaid.**

    b. **If the investment project is not operationally complete within five calendar years from the issuance of the tax deferral certificate, or if, on the basis of the tax performance report under RCW 82.32.534 or other information, the department finds that an investment project is used for purposes other than a qualified manufacturing or research and development operation at any time during the calendar year in which the investment project is certified by the department as having been operationally completed, or at any time during any of the seven succeeding calendar years, a portion of deferred taxes is immediately due according to the following schedule:**

3. For purposes of  subsection (2) **of this section**, the repayment schedule  is tolled during the period of time that a taxpayer is receiving relief from repayment of deferred taxes under RCW 82.60.063.

4. A recipient who must repay deferred taxes under subsection (3) of this section because the department has found that an investment project is not eligible for tax deferral under this chapter is no longer required to file annual tax performance reports under RCW 82.32.534 beginning on the date an investment project is used for nonqualifying purposes.

5. **The department must assess interest at the rate provided for delinquent taxes, but not penalties, retroactively to the date of deferral for a recipient who must repay deferred taxes under subsection (3) of this section because the department has found that an investment project is not eligible for tax deferral. The debt for deferred taxes will not be extinguished by insolvency or other failure of the recipient. Transfer of ownership does not terminate the deferral. The deferral is transferred, subject to the successor meeting the eligibility requirements of this chapter, for the remaining periods of the deferral.**

6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or RCW 82.32.534, deferred taxes on the following need not be repaid:

    a. Machinery and equipment, and sales of or charges made for labor and services, which at the time of purchase would have qualified for exemption under RCW 82.08.02565; and

The list of qualifying counties is effective for a **24-**month period and must be updated by July 1st of the year that is two calendar years after the list was established or last updated, as the case may be.
