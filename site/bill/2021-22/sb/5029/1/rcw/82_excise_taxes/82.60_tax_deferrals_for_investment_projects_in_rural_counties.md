## **82.60.010 - Legislative findings and declaration.**
The legislature finds that there are **counties** in the state that **experience chronically high levels of unemployment and that state policies are necessary to promote economic stimulation and new employment opportunities in these counties**. The legislature further finds that **firms participating in a tax deferral program in high unemployment counties created more jobs and experienced higher levels of income growth than firms that did not participate in the deferral**. For these reasons, the legislature reestablishes a tax deferral program to be effective solely in  counties **experiencing high levels of unemployment**. The legislature declares that this limited program serves the vital public purpose of creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty in  counties **experiencing levels of unemployment that are higher than those** of the state.

## **82.60.020 - Definitions.**
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

1. "Applicant" means a person applying for a tax deferral under this chapter.

2. "Department" means the department of revenue.

3. "Eligible area" means

a qualifying county.

4. [Empty]

    a. "Eligible investment project" means an investment project that is located, as of the date the application required by **section 3 of this act** is received by the department, in an eligible area as defined in subsection (3) of this section.

    b. "Eligible investment project" does not include any portion of an investment project undertaken by a light and power business as defined in RCW 82.16.010(4), other than that portion of a cogeneration project that is used to generate power for consumption within the manufacturing site of which the cogeneration project is an integral part, or investment projects that have already received deferrals under this chapter.

5. "Initiation of construction" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.63.010.

6. "Investment project" means an investment in qualified buildings or qualified machinery and equipment, including labor and services rendered in the planning, installation, and construction of the project.

7. "Manufacturing" means the same as defined in RCW 82.04.120. "Manufacturing" also includes:

    a.

The activities performed by research and development laboratories and commercial testing laboratories; and

    b. **The** conditioning of vegetable seeds.

8. **"Meaningful construction" means an active construction site, where excavation of a building site, laying of a building foundation, or other tangible signs of construction are taking place and that clearly show a progression in the construction process at the location designated by the taxpayer in the application for deferral. Planning, permitting, or land clearing before excavation of the building site, without more, does not constitute "meaningful construction."**

9. "Person" has the meaning given in RCW 82.04.030.

10. "Qualified buildings" means construction of new structures, and expansion or renovation of existing structures for the purpose of increasing floor space or production capacity used for manufacturing or research and development activities, including plant offices and warehouses or other facilities for the storage of raw material or finished goods if such facilities are an essential or an integral part of a factory, mill, plant, or laboratory used for manufacturing or research and development. If a building is used partly for manufacturing or research and development and partly for other purposes, the applicable tax deferral must be determined by apportionment of the costs of construction under rules adopted by the department.

11. "Qualified employment position" means a permanent full-time employee employed in the eligible investment project during the entire tax year.

"Qualified machinery and equipment" includes: Computers; software; data processing equipment; laboratory equipment; manufacturing components such as belts, pulleys, shafts, and moving parts; molds, tools, and dies; operating structures; and all equipment used to control or operate the machinery.

13. "Qualifying county" means a county that has an unemployment rate, as determined by the employment security department, which is at least **20** percent above the state average for the three calendar years immediately preceding the year in which the list of qualifying counties is established or updated, as the case may be, as provided in RCW 82.60.120.

## **82.60.049 - Additional eligible projects.**

    a. "Eligible area" also means a designated community empowerment zone approved under RCW 43.31C.020.

    b. "Eligible investment project" also means an investment project in an eligible area as defined in this section.

2.

    a. The applicant will hire at least one qualified employment position for each **$750,000** of investment for which a deferral is requested; and

    b. The positions will be filled by persons who at the time of hire are residents of the community empowerment zone. As used in this subsection, "resident" means the person makes his or her home in the community empowerment zone or the county in which the zone is located. A mailing address alone is insufficient to establish that a person is a resident for the purposes of this section. The persons must be hired after the date the application is filed with the department.

3. All other provisions and eligibility requirements of this chapter apply to applicants eligible under this section.

4. The qualified employment position must be filled by the end of the calendar year following the year in which the project is certified as operationally complete. If a person does not meet the requirements for qualified employment positions by the end of the second calendar year following the year in which the project is certified as operationally complete, all deferred taxes are immediately due.

## 82.60.063 - Repayment of deferred taxes—Relief.
1. Subject to the conditions in this section, a person is not liable for the amount of deferred taxes outstanding for an investment project when the person temporarily ceases to use its qualified buildings and qualified machinery and equipment for manufacturing or research and development activities in a county with a population of less than twenty thousand persons for a period not to exceed twenty-four months from the date that the department sent its assessment for the amount of outstanding deferred taxes to the taxpayer.

2. The relief from repayment of deferred taxes under this section does not apply unless the number of qualified employment positions maintained at the investment project after manufacturing or research and development activities are temporarily ceased is at least ten percent of the number of qualified employment positions employed at the investment project at the time the deferral was approved by the department. If a person has been approved for more than one deferral under this chapter, relief from repayment of deferred taxes under this section does not apply unless the number of qualified employment positions maintained at the investment project after manufacturing or research and development activities are temporarily ceased is at least ten percent of the highest number of qualified employment positions at the investment project at the time any of the deferrals were approved by the department. If, at any time during the twenty-four month period after the department has sent the taxpayer an assessment for outstanding deferred taxes resulting from the person temporarily ceasing to use its qualified buildings and qualified machinery and equipment for manufacturing or research and development activities, the number of qualified employment positions falls below the ten percent threshold in this subsection, the amount of deferred taxes outstanding for the project is immediately due.

3. The lessor of an investment project for which a deferral has been granted under this chapter who has passed the economic benefits of the deferral to the lessee is not eligible for relief from the payment of deferred taxes under this section.

4. A person seeking relief from the payment of deferred taxes under this section must apply to the department in a form and manner prescribed by the department. The application required under this subsection must be received by the department within thirty days of the date that the department sent its assessment for outstanding deferred taxes resulting from the person temporarily ceasing to use its qualified buildings and qualified machinery and equipment for manufacturing or research and development activities. The department must approve applications that meet the requirements in this section for relief from the payment of deferred taxes.

5. A person is entitled to relief under this section only once.

6. A person whose application for relief from the payment of deferred taxes has been approved under this section must continue to file an annual tax performance report as required under RCW 82.60.070(1) or any successor statute. In addition, the person must file, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, a report on the status of the business and the outlook for commencing manufacturing or research and development activities.

The deferral is transferred, subject to the successor meeting the eligibility requirements of this chapter, for the remaining periods of the deferral.**
