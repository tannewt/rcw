## Section 1012
> This section modifies existing section [11.02.005](/rcw/11_probate_and_trust_law/11.002_general_provisions.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/11_probate_and_trust_law/11.002_general_provisions.md) for context.

1. "Administrator" means a personal representative of the estate of a decedent and the term may be used in lieu of "personal representative" wherever required by context.

2. "Codicil" means a will that modifies or partially revokes an existing earlier will. A codicil need not refer to or be attached to the earlier will.

3. "Degree of kinship" means the degree of kinship as computed according to the rules of the civil law; that is, by counting upward from the intestate to the nearest common ancestor and then downward to the relative, the degree of kinship being the sum of these two counts.

4. **"Electronic" means relating to technology having electrical, digital, magnetic, wireless, optical, electromagnetic, or similar capabilities.**

5. **"Electronic presence" means the relationship of two or more individuals in different locations communicating in real time to the same extent as if the individuals were physically present in the same location.**

6. **"Electronic will" means a will or codicil executed in compliance with sections 1001 through 1011 of this act.**

7. "Executor" means a personal representative of the estate of a decedent appointed by will and the term may be used in lieu of "personal representative" wherever required by context.

8. "Guardian," "limited guardian," "conservator," or "limited conservator" means a personal representative of the person or estate of a person who has been placed under a guardianship under RCW 11.130.265 or who has been placed under a conservatorship under RCW 11.130.360 and the term may be used in lieu of "personal representative" wherever required by context.

9. "Heirs" denotes those persons, including the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, who are entitled under the statutes of intestate succession to the real and personal property of a decedent on the decedent's death intestate.

10. "Internal revenue code" means the United States internal revenue code of 1986, as amended or renumbered as of January 1, 2001.

11. "Issue" means all the lineal descendants of an individual. An adopted individual is a lineal descendant of each of his or her adoptive parents and of all individuals with regard to which each adoptive parent is a lineal descendant. A child conceived prior to the death of a parent but born after the death of the deceased parent is considered to be the surviving issue of the deceased parent for purposes of this title.

12. "Net estate" refers to the real and personal property of a decedent exclusive of homestead rights, exempt property, the family allowance and enforceable claims against, and debts of, the deceased or the estate.

13. "Nonprobate asset" means those rights and interests of a person having beneficial ownership of an asset that pass on the person's death under a written instrument or arrangement other than the person's will. "Nonprobate asset" includes, but is not limited to, a right or interest passing under a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, joint bank account with right of survivorship, transfer on death deed, payable on death or trust bank account, transfer on death security or security account, deed or conveyance if possession has been postponed until the death of the person, trust of which the person is grantor and that becomes effective or irrevocable only upon the person's death, community property agreement, individual retirement account or bond, or note or other contract the payment or performance of which is affected by the death of the person. "Nonprobate asset" does not include: A payable-on-death provision of a life insurance policy, annuity, or other similar contract, or of an employee benefit plan; a right or interest passing by descent and distribution under chapter 11.04 RCW; a right or interest if, before death, the person has irrevocably transferred the right or interest, the person has waived the power to transfer it or, in the case of contractual arrangement, the person has waived the unilateral right to rescind or modify the arrangement; or a right or interest held by the person solely in a fiduciary capacity. For the definition of "nonprobate asset" relating to revocation of a provision for a former spouse upon dissolution of marriage or declaration of invalidity of marriage, RCW 11.07.010(5) applies. For the definition of "nonprobate asset" relating to testamentary disposition of nonprobate assets, see RCW 11.11.010(7).

14. "Personal representative" includes executor, administrator, special administrator, and conservator or limited conservator and special representative.

15. "Real estate" includes, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and all rights thereto, and all interest therein possessed and claimed in fee simple, or for the life of a third person.

16. **"Record" means information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.**

17. "Representation" refers to a method of determining distribution in which the takers are in unequal degrees of kinship with respect to a decedent, and is accomplished as follows: After first determining who, of those entitled to share in the estate, are in the nearest degree of kinship, the estate is divided into equal shares, the number of shares being the sum of the number of persons who survive the decedent who are in the nearest degree of kinship and the number of persons in the same degree of kinship who died before the decedent but who left issue surviving the decedent; each share of a deceased person in the nearest degree must be divided among those of the deceased person's issue who survive the decedent and have no ancestor then living who is in the line of relationship between them and the decedent, those more remote in degree taking together the share which their ancestor would have taken had he or she survived the decedent.

18. References to "section 2033A" of the internal revenue code in wills, trust agreements, powers of appointment, beneficiary designations, and other instruments governed by or subject to this title are deemed to refer to the comparable or corresponding provisions of section 2057 of the internal revenue code, as added by section 6006(b) of the internal revenue service restructuring act of 1998 (H.R. 2676, P.L. 105-206); and references to the section 2033A "exclusion" are deemed to mean the section 2057 deduction.

19. "Settlor" has the same meaning as provided for "trustor" in this section.

20. "Special administrator" means a personal representative of the estate of a decedent appointed for limited purposes and the term may be used in lieu of "personal representative" wherever required by context.

21. "Surviving spouse" or "surviving domestic partner" does not include an individual whose marriage to or state registered domestic partnership with the decedent has been terminated, dissolved, or invalidated unless, by virtue of a subsequent marriage or state registered domestic partnership, he or she is married to or in a domestic partnership with the decedent at the time of death. A decree of separation that does not terminate the status of spouses or domestic partners is not a dissolution or invalidation for purposes of this subsection.

22. "Trustee" means an original, added, or successor trustee and includes the state, or any agency thereof, when it is acting as the trustee of a trust to which chapter 11.98 RCW applies.

23. "Trustor" means a person, including a testator, who creates, or contributes property to, a trust.

24. "Will" means an instrument validly executed as required by RCW 11.12.020 **or sections 1001 through 1011 of this act**.

Words that import the singular number may also be applied to the plural of persons and things.

Words importing the masculine gender only may be extended to females also.

    b. By being burnt, torn, canceled, obliterated,  destroyed, **or a physical act,** with the intent and for the purpose of revoking the same, by the testator or by another person in the presence and by the direction of the testator. If such act is done by any person other than the testator, the direction of the testator and the facts of such injury or destruction must be proved by two witnesses.

2. Revocation of a will in its entirety revokes its codicils, unless revocation of a codicil would be contrary to the testator's intent.


## Section 1015
> This section modifies existing section [11.20.020](/rcw/11_probate_and_trust_law/11.020_custody_proof_and_probate_of_wills.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/11_probate_and_trust_law/11.020_custody_proof_and_probate_of_wills.md) for context.

1. Applications for the probate of a will and for letters testamentary, or either, may be made to the judge of the court having jurisdiction and the court may immediately hear the proofs and either probate or reject such will as the testimony may justify. Upon such hearing the court shall make and cause to be entered a formal order, either establishing and probating such will, or refusing to establish and probate the same, and such order shall be conclusive except in the event of a contest of such will as hereinafter provided. All testimony in support of the will shall be reduced to writing, signed by the witnesses, and certified by the judge of the court. If the application for probate of a will does not request the appointment of a personal representative and the court enters an adjudication of testacy establishing such will no further administration shall be required except as commenced pursuant to RCW 11.28.330 or 11.28.340.

2. In addition to the foregoing procedure for the proof of wills, any or all of the attesting witnesses to a will may, at the request of the testator or, after his or her decease, at the request of the executor or any person interested under it, make an affidavit before any person authorized to administer oaths, stating such facts as they would be required to testify to in court to prove such will, which affidavit may be written on the will or may be **affixed or logically associated with** the will or  a photographic copy of the will **or an electronic will**. The sworn statement of any witness so taken shall be accepted by the court as if it had been taken before the court.

3. **An electronic will, the custody of which has not been maintained by a qualified custodian, must be treated as a lost or destroyed will under RCW 11.20.070.**


## Section 1016
> This section modifies existing section [11.20.070](/rcw/11_probate_and_trust_law/11.020_custody_proof_and_probate_of_wills.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/11_probate_and_trust_law/11.020_custody_proof_and_probate_of_wills.md) for context.

1. If a will has been lost or destroyed under circumstances such that the loss or destruction does not have the effect of revoking the will, **or is an electronic will, custody of which has not been maintained by a qualified custodian,** the court may take proof of the execution and validity of the will and establish it, notice to all persons interested having been first given. The proof must be reduced to writing and signed by any witnesses who have testified as to the execution and validity, and must be filed with the clerk of the court.

2. The provisions of a lost or destroyed will**, or an electronic will, custody of which has not been maintained by a qualified custodian,** must be proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence, consisting at least in part of a witness to either its contents or the authenticity of a copy of the will.

3. When a lost or destroyed will**, or an electronic will, custody of which has not been maintained by a qualified custodian,** is established under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, its provisions must be distinctly stated in the judgment establishing it, and the judgment must be recorded as wills are required to be recorded. A personal representative may be appointed by the court in the same manner as is herein provided with reference to original wills presented to the court for probate.

    b. If the principal place of administration of the trust is changed to this state on or after January 1, 2022, this chapter applies only to a decision or action occurring on or after the date of the change.

2. Without precluding other means to establish a sufficient connection with the designated jurisdiction in a directed trust, terms of the trust which designate the principal place of administration of the trust are valid and controlling if:

    a. A trustee's principal place of business is located in or a trustee is a resident of the designated jurisdiction;

1. In making an allocation or determination or exercising discretion under this chapter, a fiduciary shall:

    a. Act in good faith, based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries;

    d. Administer the trust or estate in accordance with this chapter, except to the extent the terms of the trust provide otherwise or authorize the fiduciary to determine otherwise.

2. A fiduciary's allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust, and an exercise of the power which produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this chapter does not create an inference that the fiduciary abused the fiduciary's discretion.

3. A fiduciary shall:

    a. Add a receipt to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the receipt between income and principal; and

    b. Charge a disbursement to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the disbursement between income and principal.

4. A fiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under section 2203 of this act, convert an income trust to a unitrust under section 2303(1)(a) of this act, change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under section 2303(1)(b) of this act, or convert a unitrust to an income trust under section 2303(1)(c) of this act, if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power is necessary to administer the trust or estate in accordance with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.

    i. The extent to which the fiduciary has accumulated income or invaded principal in preceding accounting periods;

    j. The effect of current and reasonably expected economic conditions; and

    k. The reasonably expected tax consequences of the exercise of the power.


## Section 2202
1. In this section, "fiduciary decision" means:

    a. A fiduciary's allocation between income and principal or other determination regarding income and principal required or authorized by the terms of the trust or this chapter;

    b. The fiduciary's exercise or nonexercise of a discretionary power regarding income and principal granted by the terms of the trust or this chapter, including the power to adjust under section 2203 of this act, convert an income trust to a unitrust under section 2303(1)(a) of this act, change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under section 2303(1)(b) of this act, or convert a unitrust to an income trust under section 2303(1)(c) of this act; or

    c. The fiduciary's implementation of a decision described in (a) or (b) of this subsection.

2. The court may not order a fiduciary to change a fiduciary decision unless the court determines that the fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.

3. If the court determines that a fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order a remedy authorized by law. To place the beneficiaries in the positions the beneficiaries would have occupied if there had not been an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order:

    a. The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to adjust under section 2203 of this act;

    b. The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to convert an income trust to a unitrust under section 2303(1)(a) of this act, change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under section 2303(1)(b) of this act, or convert a unitrust to an income trust under section 2303(1)(c) of this act;

    c. The fiduciary to distribute an amount to a beneficiary;

    d. A beneficiary to return some or all of a distribution; or

    e. The fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to a beneficiary.

4. On petition by a fiduciary for instruction, the court may determine whether a proposed fiduciary decision will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed decision, contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiary of the reasons for making the proposed decision and the facts on which the fiduciary relies, and explains how the beneficiary will be affected by the proposed decision, a beneficiary that opposes the proposed decision has the burden to establish that it will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.


## Section 2203
1. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of a trust or this section, a fiduciary, in a record, without court approval, may adjust between income and principal if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power to adjust is necessary to administer the trust or estate in accordance with the requirements of section 2201(1) of this act.

    b. If there is no cofiduciary to which subsection (5)(d) through (g) of this section does not apply, the fiduciary may appoint a cofiduciary to which subsection (5)(d) through (g) of this section does not apply, which may be a special fiduciary with limited powers, and the appointed cofiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section, unless the appointment of a cofiduciary or the exercise of the power by a cofiduciary is not permitted by the terms of the trust or law other than this chapter.

7. A fiduciary may release or delegate to a cofiduciary the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section if the fiduciary determines that the fiduciary's possession or exercise of the power will or may:

    c. Ownership by the fiduciary of an interest in an entity a part of whose taxable income, whether or not distributed, is includable in the taxable income of the fiduciary or a beneficiary.

2. If the amount of an estate tax marital or charitable deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes and, as a result, estate taxes paid from principal are increased and income taxes paid by the fiduciary or a beneficiary are decreased, the fiduciary shall charge each beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax to reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid. The total reimbursement must equal the increase in the estate tax, to the extent the principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital or charitable deduction but for the payment. The share of the reimbursement for each fiduciary or beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced must be the same as its share of the total decrease in income tax.

3. A fiduciary that charges a beneficiary under subsection (2) of this section may offset the charge by obtaining payment from the beneficiary, withholding an amount from future distributions to the beneficiary, or adopting another method or combination of methods.


## Section 2601
1. This section applies when:

    a. The death of an individual results in the creation of an estate or trust; or

    b. An income interest in a trust terminates, whether the trust continues or is distributed.

2. A fiduciary of an estate or trust with an income interest that terminates shall determine, under subsection (7) of this section and articles 4, 5, and 7 of this chapter, the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary. The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary that is to receive the specific property.

3. A fiduciary shall determine the income and net income of an estate or income interest in a trust which terminates, other than the amount of net income determined under subsection (2) of this section, under articles 4, 5, and 7 of this chapter and by:

    a. Including in net income all income from property used or sold to discharge liabilities;

    b. Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants, and fiduciaries, court costs and other expenses of administration, and interest on estate and inheritance taxes and other taxes imposed because of the decedent's death, but the fiduciary may pay the expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims a federal estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent:

        i. The payment of the expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; or

        ii. The fiduciary makes an adjustment under section 2507(2) of this act; and

    c. Paying from principal other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of the estate or the winding up of an income interest that terminates, including:

        i. To the extent authorized by the decedent's will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law, debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances, estate and inheritance taxes, and other taxes imposed because of the decedent's death; and

        ii. Related penalties that are apportioned, by the decedent's will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law, to the estate or income interest that terminates.

4. If a decedent's will, the terms of a trust, or applicable law provides for the payment of interest or the equivalent of interest to a beneficiary that receives a pecuniary amount outright, the fiduciary shall make the payment from net income determined under subsection (3) of this section or from principal to the extent net income is insufficient.

5. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends because of an income beneficiary's death, and no payment of interest or the equivalent of interest is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall pay the interest or the equivalent of interest to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.

6. A fiduciary shall distribute net income remaining after payments required by subsections (4) and (5) of this section in the manner described in section 2602 of this act to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary that receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.

7. A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection (2) of this section because of a payment described in section 2501 or 2502 of this act, to the extent the decedent's will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property must be determined by including the amount the fiduciary receives or pays regarding the property, whether the amount accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of the decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and making a reasonable provision for an amount the estate or income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.


## Section 2602
1. Except to the extent article 3 of this chapter applies for a beneficiary that is a trust, each beneficiary described in section 2601(6) of this act is entitled to receive a share of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to which this section applies, each beneficiary, including a beneficiary that does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to a share of the net income the fiduciary received after the decedent's death, an income interest's other terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary.

2. In determining a beneficiary's share of net income under subsection (1) of this section, the following rules apply:

    a. The beneficiary is entitled to receive a share of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date.

    b. The beneficiary's fractional interest under (a) of this subsection must be calculated:

        i. On the aggregate value of the assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation; and

        ii. Without regard to:

(A) Property specifically given to a beneficiary under the decedent's will or the terms of the trust; and

(B) Property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust.

    c. The distribution date under (a) of this subsection may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which the assets are distributed.

3. To the extent a fiduciary does not distribute under this section all the collected but undistributed net income to each beneficiary as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain records showing the interest of each beneficiary in the net income.

4. If this section applies to income from an asset, a fiduciary may apply the rules in this section to net gain or loss realized from the disposition of the asset after the decedent's death, an income interest's terminating event, or the preceding distribution by the fiduciary.


## Section 2701
1. An income beneficiary is entitled to net income in accordance with the terms of the trust from the date an income interest begins. The income interest begins on the date specified in the terms of the trust or, if no date is specified, on the date an asset becomes subject to:

    a. The trust for the current income beneficiary; or

    b. A successive interest for a successor beneficiary.

2. An asset becomes subject to a trust under subsection (1)(a) of this section:

    a. For an asset that is transferred to the trust during the settlor's life, on the date the asset is transferred;

    b. For an asset that becomes subject to the trust because of a decedent's death, on the date of the decedent's death, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the decedent's estate; or

    c. For an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of a decedent's death, on the date of the decedent's death.

3. An asset becomes subject to a successive interest under subsection (1)(b) of this section on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined under subsection (4) of this section, even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the preceding income interest.

4. An income interest ends on the day before an income beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs or on the last day of a period during which there is no beneficiary to which a fiduciary may or must distribute income.


## Section 2702
1. A fiduciary shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement, other than a receipt to which section 2601(2) of this act applies, to principal if its due date occurs before the date on which:

    a. For an estate, the decedent died; or

    b. For a trust or successive interest, an income interest begins.

2. If the due date of a periodic income receipt or disbursement occurs on or after the date on which a decedent died or an income interest begins, a fiduciary shall allocate the receipt or disbursement to income.

3. If an income receipt or disbursement is not periodic or has no due date, a fiduciary shall treat the receipt or disbursement under this section as accruing from day to day. The fiduciary shall allocate to principal the portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent died or an income interest begins, and to income the balance.

4. A receipt or disbursement is periodic under subsections (2) and (3) of this section if:

    a. The receipt or disbursement must be paid at regular intervals under an obligation to make payments; or

    b. The payor customarily makes payments at regular intervals.

5. An item of income or obligation is due under this section on the date the payor is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date.

6. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which section 2401 of this act applies are due:

    a. On the date fixed by or on behalf of the entity for determining the persons entitled to receive the distribution;

    b. If no date is fixed, on the date of the decision by or on behalf of the entity to make the distribution; or

    c. If no date is fixed and the fiduciary does not know the date of the decision by or on behalf of the entity to make the distribution, on the date the fiduciary learns of the decision.


## Section 2703
1. In this section, "undistributed income" means net income received on or before the date on which an income interest ends. The term does not include an item of income or expense which is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the terms of the trust.

2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, when a mandatory income interest of a beneficiary ends, the fiduciary shall pay the beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust to the beneficiary or, if the beneficiary does not survive the date the interest ends, to the beneficiary's estate.

3. If a beneficiary has an unqualified power to withdraw more than five percent of the value of a trust immediately before an income interest ends:

    a. The fiduciary shall allocate to principal the undistributed income from the portion of the trust which may be withdrawn; and

    b. Subsection (2) of this section applies only to the balance of the undistributed income.

4. When a fiduciary's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of assets ends, the fiduciary shall prorate the final payment as required to preserve an income tax, gift tax, estate tax, or other tax benefit.


## Section 2801
1. In applying and construing this uniform act, consideration must be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it.

2. To the extent that this chapter is in conflict with RCW 11.68.090, RCW 11.68.090 prevails.

1. In this section, "power of appointment created by the powerholder" includes a power of appointment created in a transfer by another person to the extent the powerholder contributed value to the transfer.

2. Appointive property subject to a general power of appointment created by the powerholder is subject to a claim of a creditor of the powerholder or of the powerholder's estate to the extent provided in chapter 19.40 RCW.

3. Subject to subsection (2) of this section, appointive property subject to a general power of appointment created by the powerholder is not subject to a claim of a creditor of the powerholder or the powerholder's estate to the extent the powerholder irrevocably appointed the property in favor of a person other than the powerholder or the powerholder's estate.

4. Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, and notwithstanding the presence of a spendthrift provision or whether the claim arose before or after the creation of the power of appointment, appointive property subject to a general power of appointment created by the powerholder is subject to a claim of a creditor of:

    a. The powerholder, to the same extent as if the powerholder owned the appointive property, if the power is presently exercisable; and

    b. The powerholder's estate, to the extent the estate is insufficient to satisfy the claim and subject to the right of a decedent to direct the source from which liabilities are paid, if the power is exercisable at the powerholder's death.


## Section 3502
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, appointive property subject to a general power of appointment created by a person other than the powerholder is subject to a claim of a creditor of:

    a. The powerholder, to the extent the powerholder's property is insufficient, if the power is presently exercisable; and

    b. The powerholder's estate, to the extent the estate is insufficient, subject to the right of a decedent to direct the source from which liabilities are paid.

2.

Sec. 2041(b)(1)(A) or 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2514(c)(1), on the effective date of this section, is treated for purposes of sections 3501 through 3504 of this act as a nongeneral power.


## Section 3503
1. For purposes of sections 3501 through 3504 of this act, and except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, a power to withdraw property from a trust is treated, during the time the power may be exercised, as a presently exercisable general power of appointment to the extent of the property subject to the power to withdraw.

2. On the lapse, release, or waiver of a power to withdraw property from a trust, the power is treated as a presently exercisable general power of appointment only to the extent the value of the property affected by the lapse, release, or waiver exceeds the greater of the amount specified in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2041(b)(2) and 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2514(e) or the amount specified in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 2503(b), on the effective date of this section.

2. Appointive property subject to a nongeneral power of appointment is subject to a claim of a creditor of the powerholder or the powerholder's estate to the extent that the powerholder owned the property and, reserving the nongeneral power, transferred the property in violation of chapter 19.40 RCW.

3. If the initial gift in default of appointment is to the powerholder or the powerholder's estate, a nongeneral power of appointment is treated for purposes of this section and sections 3501 through 3503 of this act as a general power.

Unless otherwise provided, when any property shall be given **or any appointee appointed** under a will, or under a trust of which the decedent is a grantor and which by its terms becomes irrevocable upon or before the grantor's death, to any issue of a grandparent of the decedent and that issue dies before the decedent, or dies before that issue's interest is no longer subject to a contingency, leaving descendants who survive the decedent, those descendants shall take that property **or appointment** as the predeceased issue would have done if the predeceased issue had survived the decedent. If those descendants are all in the same degree of kinship to the predeceased issue they shall take equally or, if of unequal degree, then those of more remote degree shall take by representation with respect to the predeceased issue.


## Section 3605
> This section modifies existing section [11.12.120](/rcw/11_probate_and_trust_law/11.012_wills.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/11_probate_and_trust_law/11.012_wills.md) for context.

1. If a will makes a gift to a person on the condition that the person survive the testator and the person does not survive the testator, then, unless otherwise provided, the gift lapses and falls into the residue of the estate to be distributed under the residuary clause of the will, if any, but otherwise according to the laws of descent and distribution.

2. If the will gives the residue to two or more persons, the share of a person who does not survive the testator passes, unless otherwise provided, and subject to RCW 11.12.110, to the other person or persons receiving the residue, in proportion to the interest of each in the remaining part of the residue.

3. The personal representative of the testator, a person who would be affected by the lapse or distribution of a gift under this section, or a guardian ad litem or other representative appointed to represent the interests of a person so affected may petition the court for a determination under this section, and the petition must be heard under the procedures of chapter 11.96A RCW.

4. **For purposes of this section, the appointment of an appointee under a will is a gift and may form part of the residue.**

If the holder of a lifetime or testamentary power of appointment may exercise the power in his or her own favor only for his or her health, education, support, or maintenance as described in section 2041 or 2514 of the Internal Revenue Code and the applicable regulations adopted under that section, then a provision of the instrument creating the power of appointment that purports to confer "absolute," "sole," "complete," "conclusive," or a similar discretion shall be disregarded in the exercise of that power in favor of the holder, and that power may then only be exercised reasonably and in accordance with the ascertainable standards set forth in RCW 11.95.100 (as recodified by this act) and this section. A person who has the right to remove or replace a trustee does not possess nor may the person be deemed to possess, by virtue of having that right, the power of the trustee who is subject to removal or to replacement.


## Section 3607

Notwithstanding any provision of RCW 11.95.100 through 11.95.150 (as recodified by this act) seemingly to the contrary, RCW 11.95.100 through 11.95.150 (as recodified by this act) do not limit or restrict the distribution of income of a trust that qualifies or that otherwise could have qualified for the marital deduction under section 2056 or 2523 of the Internal Revenue Code, those Internal Revenue Code sections requiring that all income be distributed to the spouse of the decedent or of the trustor at least annually, whether or not an election was in fact made under section 2056(b)(7) or 2523(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, RCW 11.95.100 through 11.95.150 (as recodified by this act) do not limit or restrict the power of a spouse of the trustor or the spouse of the decedent to exercise a power of appointment described in section 2056(b)(5) or 2523(e) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to that portion of the trust that could otherwise qualify for the marital deduction under either of those Internal Revenue Code sections.

RCW 11.95.100 through 11.95.150 (as recodified by this act) do not raise an inference that the law of this state prior to July 25, 1993, was different than contained in RCW 11.95.100 through 11.95.150 (as recodified by this act).

(C) A person entitled to judicial proceedings for a declaration of rights or legal relations under RCW 11.96A.080 obtains a judicial determination that the application of this subsection (1)(a)(ii) to the trust is inconsistent with the provisions or purposes of the will or trust.

    b. Notwithstanding (a) of this subsection, for the purposes of this section a codicil to a will, an amendment to a trust, or an amendment to another instrument that created the power of appointment in question shall not be deemed to cause that instrument to be executed after July 25, 1993, unless the codicil or amendment clearly shows an intent to have RCW 11.95.100 or 11.95.110 (as recodified by this act) apply.

    a. The terms of the instrument specifically refer to RCW 11.95.100 or 11.95.110 (as recodified by this act) respectively and provide expressly to the contrary; or

    b. The person creating the power of appointment was not competent, on July 25, 1993, to revoke, amend, or modify the instrument creating the power of appointment and did not regain his or her competence to revoke, amend, or modify the instrument creating the power of appointment on or before his or her death or before the time at which the instrument could no longer be revoked, amended, or modified by the person.

3. **For purposes of this section, a reference in an instrument to:**

    a. **RCW 11.95.100 is a reference to RCW 11.95.100 (as recodified by this act); and**

If any specific provision of those chapters is in conflict with the provisions of a trust, the provisions of the trust control whether or not specific reference is made in the trust to any of those chapters, except as provided in RCW 6.32.250, 11.96A.190, 19.36.020, 11.98.002, 11.98.200 through 11.98.240, 11.98.072(1), 11.95.100 (as recodified by this act) through 11.95.150 (as recodified by this act), and chapter 11.103 RCW. In no event may a trustee be relieved of the duty to act in good faith and with honest judgment.
