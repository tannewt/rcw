## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [48.18.545](/rcw/48_insurance/48.018_the_insurance_contract.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/48_insurance/48.018_the_insurance_contract.md) for context.

1. For the purposes of this section:

    a. "Adverse action" has the same meaning as defined in the fair credit reporting act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq. Adverse actions include, but are not limited to:

        i. Cancellation, denial, or nonrenewal of personal insurance coverage;

        ii. Charging a higher insurance premium for personal insurance than would have been offered if the credit history or insurance score had been more favorable, whether the charge is by:

(A) Application of a rating rule;

(B) Assignment to a rating tier that does not have the lowest available rates; or

(C) Placement with an affiliate company that does not offer the lowest rates available to the consumer within the affiliate group of insurance companies; or

        iii. Any reduction, adverse, or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of any personal insurance due to a consumer's credit history or insurance score. A reduction, adverse, or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage occurs when:

(A) Coverage provided to the consumer is not as broad in scope as coverage requested by the consumer but available to other insureds of the insurer or any affiliate; or

(B) The consumer is not eligible for benefits such as dividends that are available through affiliate insurers.

    b. "Affiliate" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 48.31B.005(1).

    c. "Consumer" means an individual policyholder or applicant for insurance.

    d. "Consumer report" has the same meaning as defined in the fair credit reporting act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.

    e. "Credit history" means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity that is used or expected to be used, or collected in whole or in part, for the purpose of serving as a factor in determining personal insurance premiums or eligibility for coverage.

    f. "Insurance score" means a number or rating that is derived from an algorithm, computer application, model, or other process that is based in whole or in part on credit history.

    g. "Personal insurance" means:

        i. Private passenger automobile coverage;

        ii. Homeowner's coverage, including mobile homeowners, manufactured homeowners, condominium owners, and renter's coverage;

        iii. Dwelling property coverage;

        iv. Earthquake coverage for a residence or personal property;

    v. Personal liability and theft coverage;

    vi. Personal inland marine coverage; and

    vii. Mechanical breakdown coverage for personal auto or home appliances.

    h. "Tier" means a category within a single insurer into which insureds with substantially like insuring, risk or exposure factors, and expense elements are placed for purposes of determining rate or premium.

2. An insurer that takes adverse action against a consumer based in whole or in part on credit history or insurance score shall provide written notice to the applicant or named insured. The notice must state the significant factors of the credit history or insurance score that resulted in the adverse action. The insurer shall also inform the consumer that the consumer is entitled to a free copy of their consumer report under the fair credit reporting act.

3. An insurer shall not cancel or nonrenew personal insurance based in whole or in part on a consumer's credit history or insurance score. An offer of placement with an affiliate insurer does not constitute cancellation or nonrenewal under this section.

4. An insurer may use credit history to deny personal insurance only in combination with other substantive underwriting factors. For the purposes of this subsection:

    a. "Deny" means an insurer refuses to offer insurance coverage to a consumer;

    b. An offer of placement with an affiliate insurer does not constitute denial of coverage; and

    c. An insurer may reject an application when coverage is not bound or cancel an insurance contract within the first sixty days after the effective date of the contract.

5. Insurers shall not deny personal insurance coverage based on:

    a. The absence of credit history or the inability to determine the consumer's credit history, if the insurer has received accurate and complete information from the consumer;

    b. The number of credit inquiries;

    c. Credit history or an insurance score based on collection accounts identified with a medical industry code;

    d. The initial purchase or finance of a vehicle or house that adds a new loan to the consumer's existing credit history, if evident from the consumer report; however, an insurer may consider the bill payment history of any loan, the total number of loans, or both;

    e. The consumer's use of a particular type of credit card, charge card, or debit card; or

    f. The consumer's total available line of credit; however, an insurer may consider the total amount of outstanding debt in relation to the total available line of credit.

6. [Empty]

    a. If disputed credit history is used to determine eligibility for coverage and a consumer is placed with an affiliate that charges higher premiums or offers less favorable policy terms:

        i. The insurer shall reissue or rerate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the current policy term; and

        ii. The policy, as reissued or rerated, shall provide premiums and policy terms the consumer would have been eligible for if accurate credit history had been used to determine eligibility.

    b. This subsection only applies if the consumer resolves the dispute under the process set forth in the fair credit reporting act and notifies the insurer in writing that the dispute has been resolved.

7. [Empty]

    a. **Notwithstanding any other law or regulation, an insurer that uses credit information shall, on written request from an applicant for insurance coverage or an insured, provide reasonable exceptions to the insurer's rates, rating classifications, company or tier placement, or underwriting rules or guidelines for a consumer who has experienced and whose credit information has been directly influenced by any of the following events:**

        i. **Require the consumer to provide reasonable written and independently verifiable documentation of the event;**

        ii. **Require the consumer to demonstrate that the event had direct and meaningful impact on the consumer's credit information;**

        iii. **Require such request be made no more than 60 days from the date of the application for insurance or the policy renewal;**

        iv. **Grant an exception despite the consumer not providing the initial request for an exception in writing; and**

    v. **Grant an exception where the consumer asks for consideration of repeated events or the insurer has considered this event previously.**

    c. **An insurer is not out of compliance with any law or rule relating to underwriting, rating, or rate filing as a result of granting an exception under this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed to provide a consumer or other insured with a cause of action that does not exist in the absence of this section.**

    d. **The insurer shall provide notice to consumers that reasonable exceptions are available and information about how the consumer may inquire further.**

    e. **Within 30 days of the insurer's receipt of sufficient documentation of an event described in (a) of this subsection, the insurer shall inform the consumer of the outcome of the request for a reasonable exception.
