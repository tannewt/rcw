## Section 1
The legislature finds that equitable public policy discussions should include individuals directly impacted by that policy. In order to do so, the legislature supports removing barriers to that participation. The legislature finds that asking community members with lower financial means to volunteer their time and expertise while state employees and representatives of advocacy organizations receive compensation from their respective agency or organization for their time and experience ultimately hinders full and open public participation. As a result, the legislature finds that removing financial barriers for those individuals fosters increased access to government and enriches public policy discussions and decisions, ultimately leading to more equitable and sustainable policy outcomes.


## Section 3
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [43.03](/rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.003_salaries_and_expenses.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/43_state_government—executive/43.003_salaries_and_expenses.md) for context.

    a. A brief description of the groups for which stipends have been made available;

    b. An accounting of the stipends provided; and

    c. An analysis of whether and how the availability of stipends has reduced barriers to participation and increased the diversity of group participants.

2. The Washington state office of equity shall:

    a. Compile and analyze the information received from agencies under this section;

    b. Consult with stakeholder communities; and

    c. Prepare a report to the governor and legislature by August 30, 2024.
