## Section 1
Disruptions to the food supply chain due to the coronavirus pandemic revealed the importance and limitations of Washington's local meat processing system capacity. State investment in local meat processors is needed to modernize operations and ensure functional capacity of the system. Support for the small meat processors provides multiple benefits for the greater public good including continuity of food supply and resilience in the face of supply chain disruptions, consumer food safety and public health, animal health and welfare, and increased economic growth opportunities for both meat processor small businesses, skilled workforce, and livestock producers.

The legislature finds that consumers and small to mid-scale farmers would both benefit from greater access to meat and poultry processing facilities that would allow the farmer to sell meat and poultry to consumers who would like a greater opportunity to support local agriculture, while also ensuring that the meat and poultry are inspected under a program that safeguards consumers from possible harm. Direct marketing assistance will play a critical role in considering the economic viability of meat and poultry processing facilities and providing small and midsize farms with the ability to sell meat and poultry to consumers at retail.

Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the commission must develop a grant program, in cooperation with other partners, to provide funding to districts to provide access to meat and poultry processing and inspection within the district. In addition to other funding needs to provide access to meat and poultry processing and inspection within the district, grant funding may be used by districts to establish a mobile slaughter unit or to provide needed infrastructure to provide for the retail sale of meat or poultry. The commission must conduct outreach to gain input from other entities, such as conservation districts, Washington State University and the food policy forum in developing the grant program described in this section.
