## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that animals slaughtered for their fur endure tremendous suffering. Animals raised on fur farms typically spend their entire lives in cramped, filthy cages. Fur farmers typically use the cheapest killing methods available, including suffocation, electrocution, gas, and poison.

2. Fur farms are reservoirs and transmission vectors for dangerous zoonotic diseases, including SARS coronaviruses, that threaten public health, including in Washington. COVID-19 infections have been confirmed at fur farms in Europe and the United States, and scientific studies have linked animals most commonly farmed for their fur, including mink, raccoon, dogs, and foxes, to a variety of coronaviruses.

3. Considering the wide array of alternatives for fashion and apparel, the legislature finds that the demand for fur products does not justify the unnecessary killing and cruel treatment of animals.

4. Eliminating the sale of fur products in Washington will promote community awareness of animal welfare and, in turn, will foster a more humane environment in Washington.
