The state board for community and technical colleges was tasked by the legislature in section 7038, chapter 332, Laws of 2021 to report on alternative methods of prioritizing and presenting the list of requested capital projects for community and technical colleges in the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium. The state board for community and technical colleges shall implement for the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium the report's option of a single prioritized request with minor projects above major projects and with all of the funding needed for design and construction included in a single biennium. However, in recognition of the transition to this new prioritized request method, projects that received funding for design only in the 2019-2021 or 2021-2023 fiscal biennia must receive priority over new major project requests in the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium request.
