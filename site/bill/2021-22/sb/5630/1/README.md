# Senate Bill 5630

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5630.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that research shows that children who participate in high quality early learning programs have improved school and life outcomes. The legislature further finds that access to high quality early learning programs and affordable child care is not equal statewide and leads to disparate outcomes. Lack of access to these programs has a disproportionate impact on working families, low-income families, and families of color, which have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and has impacted parents' ability to return to work.

2. The legislature acknowledges that the legislature passed chapter 548, Laws of 2009 that stated the legislature's intent to establish a program of early learning for at-risk children and include it within the overall program of basic education, but this program was vetoed by the governor. The legislature intends to renew its goal of expanding access to high quality early learning programs and address unequal access by phasing in an expanded statutory program of basic education to include early learning. The basic education program of early learning would be phased in for three and four year olds starting in the 2026-27 school year and making it an entitlement for all three and four year olds by the 2029-30 school year.

3. The legislature further intends to convene a work group to discuss and plan the incorporation of certain early learning programs into the program of basic education by the 2029-30 school year and establish a robust, comprehensive system of early learning from birth through age eight. The legislature intends for this state investment in high quality early learning programs to improve opportunities for student success in school and throughout life.


## Section 2
1. By December 1, 2024, the office of the superintendent of public instruction, in consultation with the department of children, youth, and families, the Washington professional educator standards board, and the Washington paraeducator board, shall examine the statutory authority, rules, and jurisdiction between the K-12 and early learning education systems and make recommendations to the education committees of the legislature regarding changes or clarifications to the applicable statutes, rules, and jurisdiction of the office of the superintendent of public instruction and the department of children, youth, and families that are necessary to implement this act.

2. The superintendent of public instruction, the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families, and the director of the office of financial management, or their respective designees, shall report to the appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1, 2024, with recommendations for a budgeting and funding allocation method for the basic education program of early learning established under section 3 of this act based on an estimate of eligible students. Recommendations must include a schedule of implementation consistent with section 3 of this act to provide for the incorporation of certain early learning programs into the program of basic education by the 2029-30 school year.

3. This section expires July 1, 2025.


## Section 3
1. The basic education program of early learning is established.
