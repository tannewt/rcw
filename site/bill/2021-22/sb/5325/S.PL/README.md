    b. The behavioral health service is medically necessary.

2. [Empty]

    a. If the service is provided through store and forward technology there must be an associated visit between the covered person and the referring provider. Nothing in this section prohibits the use of telemedicine for the associated office visit.

A distant site or any other site not identified in subsection (3) of this section may not charge a facility fee.

5. Behavioral health administrative services organizations and managed care organizations may not distinguish between originating sites that are rural and urban in providing the coverage required in subsection (1) of this section.

    c. "Originating site" means the physical location of a patient receiving behavioral health services through telemedicine;

    e. "Store and forward technology" means use of an asynchronous transmission of a covered person's medical or behavioral health information from an originating site to the provider at a distant site which results in medical or behavioral health diagnosis and management of the covered person, and does not include the use of audio-only telephone, facsimile, or email; and
