# Substitute Senate Bill 5348 as Recommended by Law & Justice

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5348-S.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds it unconscionable that health care providers may misrepresent the source of the gametes provided to assisted reproduction patients. In such cases, false information leaves the children conceived through assisted reproduction without accurate information about their identity, family medical history, and true genetic parentage.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [18.130](/rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.130_regulation_of_health_professions—uniform_disciplinary_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.130_regulation_of_health_professions—uniform_disciplinary_act.md) for context.

1. A health care provider licensed under Title 18 RCW is guilty of false representation in assisted reproduction if he or she knowingly provides false information to a patient related to gametes used or provided for assisted reproduction or the donor of the gametes.

2. The appropriate board or commission under Title 18 RCW or department may investigate any allegations of false representation under this section, and may conduct an enforcement action against the licensed provider pursuant to this chapter.

3. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Assisted reproduction" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 26.26A.010.

    b. "Donor" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 26.26A.010.

    c. "Gamete" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 26.26A.010.

    d. "Health care provider" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 7.70.020.


## Section 3
> This section modifies existing section [18.130.180](/rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.130_regulation_of_health_professions—uniform_disciplinary_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/18_businesses_and_professions/18.130_regulation_of_health_professions—uniform_disciplinary_act.md) for context.

The following conduct, acts, or conditions constitute unprofessional conduct for any license holder under the jurisdiction of this chapter:

1. The commission of any act involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption relating to the practice of the person's profession, whether the act constitutes a crime or not. If the act constitutes a crime, conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a condition precedent to disciplinary action. Upon such a conviction, however, the judgment and sentence is conclusive evidence at the ensuing disciplinary hearing of the guilt of the license holder of the crime described in the indictment or information, and of the person's violation of the statute on which it is based. For the purposes of this section, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for the conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

2. Misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact in obtaining a license or in reinstatement thereof;

3. All advertising which is false, fraudulent, or misleading;

4. Incompetence, negligence, or malpractice which results in injury to a patient or which creates an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed. The use of a nontraditional treatment by itself shall not constitute unprofessional conduct, provided that it does not result in injury to a patient or create an unreasonable risk that a patient may be harmed;

5. Suspension, revocation, or restriction of the individual's license to practice any health care profession by competent authority in any state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, a certified copy of the order, stipulation, or agreement being conclusive evidence of the revocation, suspension, or restriction;

6. Except when authorized by RCW 18.130.345, the possession, use, prescription for use, or distribution of controlled substances or legend drugs in any way other than for legitimate or therapeutic purposes, diversion of controlled substances or legend drugs, the violation of any drug law, or prescribing controlled substances for oneself;

7. Violation of any state or federal statute or administrative rule regulating the profession in question, including any statute or rule defining or establishing standards of patient care or professional conduct or practice;

    a. Not furnishing any papers, documents, records, or other items;

    b. Not furnishing in writing a full and complete explanation covering the matter contained in the complaint filed with the disciplining authority;

    c. Not responding to subpoenas issued by the disciplining authority, whether or not the recipient of the subpoena is the accused in the proceeding; or

16. Promotion for personal gain of any unnecessary or inefficacious drug, device, treatment, procedure, or service;

17. Conviction of any gross misdemeanor or felony relating to the practice of the person's profession. For the purposes of this subsection, conviction includes all instances in which a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is the basis for conviction and all proceedings in which the sentence has been deferred or suspended. Nothing in this section abrogates rights guaranteed under chapter 9.96A RCW;

18. The procuring, or aiding or abetting in procuring, a criminal abortion;

19. The offering, undertaking, or agreeing to cure or treat disease by a secret method, procedure, treatment, or medicine, or the treating, operating, or prescribing for any health condition by a method, means, or procedure which the licensee refuses to divulge upon demand of the disciplining authority;

20. The willful betrayal of a practitioner-patient privilege as recognized by law;

21. Violation of chapter 19.68 RCW or a pattern of violations of RCW 41.05.700(8), 48.43.735(8), 48.49.020, 48.49.030, 71.24.335(8), or 74.09.325(8);
