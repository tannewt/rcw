# Senate Bill 5755

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5755.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that:

1. Many cities in Washington are actively planning for growth under the growth management act, chapter 36.70A RCW;

2. The construction industry provides living wage jobs for families across Washington;

3. In the current economic climate, the creation of additional affordable housing units is essential to the economic health of our cities and our state;

4. It is critical that Washington state promote its cities and its property owners that will provide affordable housing;

5. A meaningful, fair, and predictable economic incentive should be created to stimulate the redevelopment of vacant or underdeveloped property in targeted urban areas through a limited sales and use tax deferral program as provided by this chapter; and

6. This limited tax deferral will help the owners of vacant or undeveloped property achieve the highest and best use of land and enable cities to more fully realize their planning goals.


## Section 2
It is the purpose of this chapter to encourage the redevelopment of vacant or undeveloped land in targeted urban areas, thereby increasing affordable housing, employment opportunities, and helping accomplish the other planning goals of Washington cities. The legislative authorities of cities to which this chapter applies may authorize a sales and use tax deferral for an investment project within the city if the legislative authority of the city finds that there are both significant areas of vacant or undeveloped land and a lack of affordable housing in areas proximate to the vacant or undeveloped land. If a conditional recipient maintains the property for qualifying purposes for at least 10 years, deferred sales and use taxes need not be repaid.


## Section 3
The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

1. "Affordable housing" means multifamily housing that is rented by a person or household whose monthly housing costs, including utilities other than telephone, do not exceed 30 percent of the household's monthly income.

8. "Governing authority" means the local legislative authority of a city having jurisdiction over the property for which a deferral may be granted under this chapter.

9. "Household" means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together.

The department must assess interest at the rate provided for delinquent taxes and penalties retroactively to the date of deferral. A debt for deferred taxes will not be extinguished by insolvency or other failure of the recipient. Transfer of ownership does not terminate the deferral.
