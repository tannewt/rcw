# Senate Bill 5767

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5767.pdf)
## Section 1
Since the inception of the legal, regulated marketplace for cannabis in Washington state, the industry across the United States continues to innovate and evolve. The legislature finds that while the legal, regulated industry has striven to provide safe products to consumers, the illicit market has continued to find ways to avoid regulation, resulting in unregulated, untested, and potentially unsafe products available outside of the regulated market. Due to this and the evolving nature of new cannabinoids identified in the Cannabis sativa L. plant, the legislature finds there is a need to provide consumers legal access to safe products in the regulated cannabis market. The legislature further finds there is a need to ensure appropriate labeling, serving size, and disclosure standards for any regulated cannabinoid. The legislature intends to create a robust regulatory framework for naturally occurring cannabinoids found in the Cannabis sativa L. plant while allowing continued innovation in the regulated market.

## Section 7
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [69.50](/rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.50_uniform_controlled_substances_act.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/69_food_drugs_cosmetics_and_poisons/69.50_uniform_controlled_substances_act.md) for context.

1. All marijuana producers, processors, certified labs, and certified lab employees must comply with the testing requirements described in this section.

2. The following fields of testing are only required for samples of marijuana flower that have not been previously tested, or that have failed previous quality control testing:

    a. Potency analysis.

        i. Certified labs must test and report the following cannabinoids to the board when testing for potency:

(A) THCA;

(B) THC;

(C) Total THC, which must be calculated as follows, where M is the mass or mass fraction of delta-9 THC or delta-9 THCA: M total delta-9 THC = M delta-9 THC + (0.877 multiplied by M delta-9 THCA);

(D) CBDA;

(E) CBD; and

(F) Total CBD, which must be calculated as follows, where M is the mass or mass fraction of CBD and CBDA: M total CBD = M CBD + (0.877 multiplied by M CBDA).

        ii. Any impairing cannabinoids intentionally added to the formula of a product must be tested for potency including, but not limited to, delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol.

        iii. Regardless of analytical equipment or methodology, certified labs must accurately measure and report the acidic, THCA and CBDA, and neutral, THC and CBD, forms of the cannabinoids.

    b. Potency analysis for flower lots.

        i. Certified labs must test and report the results of the required flower lot samples for the following cannabinoids including, but not limited to:

(A) THCA;

(B) THC;

(C) Total THC, which must be calculated as follows, where M is the mass or mass fraction of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinolic acid: M total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol = M delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol + (0.877 multiplied by M delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinolic acid);

(D) CBDA;

(E) CBD; and

(F) Total CBD, which must be calculated as follows, where M is the mass or mass fraction of CBD and CBDA: M total CBD = M CBD + (0.877 multiplied by M CBDA).

        ii. Certified labs must test each flower lot identified in rule by the board for the following:

(A) Moisture analysis. The sample and related lot or batch fails quality control testing for moisture analysis if the results exceed the following limits:

(I) Water activity rate greater than 0.65; or

(II) Moisture content greater than 15 percent.

(B) Foreign matter screening. The sample and related lot or batch fail quality control testing for foreign matter screening if the results exceed the following limits:

(I) Five percent of stems three millimeters or more in diameter;

(II) Two percent of seeds or other foreign matter; or

(III) One insect fragment, one hair, or one mammalian excreta per sample.

(C) Microbiological screening. The sample and related lot or batch fail quality control testing for microbiological screening if the results for unprocessed plant material or extracted or processed botanical products exceed the following limits:

(I) For enterobacteria, bile-tolerant gram-negative bacteria, 10 grams; and

(II) For E.Coli, pathogenic strains, and Salmonella spp., not detective in one gram.

(D) Mycotoxin screening. For the purposes of mycotoxin screening, a sample passes quality control testing if it contains less than 20 micrograms of medication per kilogram of body weight for the following:

(I) A total of aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin B2, aflatoxin G1, and aflatoxin G2; or

(II) Ochratoxin A.

    c. Residual solvent screening. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (2)(c), a sample and related lot or batch fail quality control testing for residual solvents if the results exceed the limits provided in this subsection (2)(c). Residual solvent results greater than 5,000 parts per million for class three solvents, 50 parts per million for class two solvents, and two parts per million for class one solvents as defined in United States Pharmacopeia, USP 30 Chemical Tests / <467> - Residual Solvents and not listed in (c)(i) through (viii) of this subsection fail quality control testing. When residual solvent screening is required, certified labs must test, at minimum, for the following solvents and fail those solvents that exceed the following limits:

        i. Acetone, butanes, ethyl acetate, heptanes, isopropanol, pentanes, and propane, 5,000 parts per million;

        ii. Cyclohexane, 3,880 parts per million;

        iii. Methanol, 3,000 parts per million;

        iv. Xylene, 2,170 parts per million;

    v. Toulene, 890 parts per million;

    vi. Dichloromethane, 600 parts per million;

    vii. Benzene and Chloroform, two parts per million; and

    viii. Hexanes, zero parts per million.

    d. Heavy metal screening. A sample and related lot or batch fail quality control testing for heavy metals if the results exceed the following limits:

        i. Lead, 0.5 parts per million;

        ii. Arsenic and cadmium, 0.2 parts per million; and

        iii. Mercury, 0.1 parts per million.

    e. Pesticide screening. For the purposes of pesticide screening, a sample passes quality control testing if it meets the standards described in rule by the board regarding pesticide action levels and any rules adopted by the department of agriculture under chapter 17.21 RCW.

3. The following quality control tests are required for each of the marijuana products described below. Licensees and certified labs may opt to perform additional quality control tests on the same lot.

    a. Marijuana flower lots. Marijuana flower lots or other material that will not be extracted require the following quality control tests:

        i. Moisture analysis;
