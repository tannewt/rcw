Beginning with the second renewal, at least six of the continuing education hours in the preceding two years must be in professional ethics.

    b. If the secretary finds that a waiver to allow additional renewals is justified due to barriers to testing or training resulting from a governor-declared emergency, additional renewals may be approved.
