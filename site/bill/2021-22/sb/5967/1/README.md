# Senate Bill 5967

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5967.pdf)
## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that:

    a. The Paris agreement is a binding international treaty on climate change, which was adopted by 196 parties, including the United States in Paris, in 2015;

    b. The Paris agreement is a landmark agreement that establishes a framework for bringing all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects;

    c. In recent years, the state of Washington has taken equally ambitious efforts to meet science-based net zero targets by 2050 under RCW 70A.45.020. In order to meet these obligations, the state has adopted a range of decarbonization bills including: Cap and invest, clean fuel standard, eliminating fossil fuels from electricity supply by 2045, building efficiency standards, hydrofluorocarbon elimination, electrification of transportation, and more;

    d. Implementation of these policies requires economic and social transformation;

    e. To achieve economic and social transformation, it is essential that every private and governmental institution, and the citizenry served by these institutions, contribute to this effort;

    f. Notwithstanding these global, national, and state-level efforts to address climate change, the world's largest commercial and investment banks have been largely omitted from these efforts and, to a certain extent, impeded these efforts in recent years through fossil fuel industry financing practices;

    g. In fact, banks play a disproportionate and comprehensive role in climate change by financing fossil fuel projects worldwide that are directly and scientifically shown to be the primary cause of climate change. Between 2016 and 2021, data shows that the 60 largest commercial and investment banks through their lending and underwriting practices invested a total of $3,800,000,000,000 into fossil fuels;

    h. Despite this track record by the financial industry of continuing to pour financing into companies that directly engage in oil and gas extraction, petroleum refining, coal mining, and other fossil fuel industries, a coalition of the world's biggest investors, banks and insurers at the 2021 climate change conference made a pledge, referred to as the Glasgow financial alliance for net zero, to align their lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050. According to a press release by the Glasgow financial alliance for net zero, participating financial institutions "have committed to high ambition, science-based targets, including achieving net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, delivering their fair share of 50 percent emission reductions this decade, and reviewing their targets towards this every five years"; and

    i. In 2020, the office of financial management prepared a report indicating that, in the 2019-2021 biennium, the state spent approximately $1,400,000,000 on programs, projects, and activities that contribute to climate resiliency.

2. Therefore it is the legislature's intent to:

    a. Require financial institutions to directly, demonstrably, and transparently contribute at the state level to Washington's climate resiliency and mitigation commitment efforts;

    b. Provide additional funding for climate resiliency efforts;

    c. Encourage financial institutions to expeditiously cease financial practices that create a negative externality and impede efforts to address climate change; and

    d. Achieve these objectives by establishing a surcharge on financial institutions that continue to significantly finance the fossil fuel industry.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [70A.05](/rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.005_integrated_climate_change_response_strategy.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/70A_environmental_health_and_safety/70A.005_integrated_climate_change_response_strategy.md) for context.

1. [Empty]

    a. From January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2049, a climate resiliency and mitigation surcharge is imposed on specified financial institutions that are bankers of fossil fuels. The surcharge is equal to the gross income of the business taxable under RCW 82.04.290(2) multiplied by the rate specified under (b) of this subsection (1). The surcharge is in addition to any other fees or taxes imposed on specified financial institutions.

    b. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the rate for the climate resiliency and mitigation surcharge is determined by the total amount of adjusted fossil fuel financing provided by a specified financial institution's consolidated financial institution group, as a percentage of total financing for all industries provided by the institution's consolidated financial institution group, for the prior calendar year, based on the following schedule:

Adjusted Fossil Fuel Financing as Percent of Total Financing

Climate Resiliency and Mitigation

Surcharge Rate

4.0 percent or more

0.50 percent

2.5 percent or more to 4.0 percent

0.375 percent

Less than 2.5 percent

0.25 percent

    c. The rate under (b) of this subsection for a specified financial institution must be adjusted July 1, 2024, and each July 1st thereafter, if: (i) The specified financial institution's consolidated financial institution group's adjusted fossil fuel financing percentage, as determined by the most recent Washington fossil fuel financing report, requires a different rate under (b) of this subsection; or (ii) the specified financial institution is no longer a banker of fossil fuels.

2. The department of revenue shall administer the climate resiliency and mitigation surcharge imposed under this section in a manner consistent with the financial institution surtax under RCW 82.04.29004. The conditions and requirements in RCW 82.04.29004 (3) and (4) apply to this section.

3. [Empty]

    a. By October 1, 2022, the department of commerce must publish a report assessing the adjusted fossil fuel financing, as a percentage of total financing for all industries, for each specified financial institution's consolidated financial institution group in calendar year 2021. To make this determination, the department of commerce shall use league tables published by a well-established financial data analytics and services firm that provides financial, economic, and government information covering industry sectors. The report published under this subsection (3)(a) must be used to set the rate under subsection (1)(b) of this section for calendar year 2023.

    b. By April 1, 2024, and by each April 1st thereafter, the department of commerce must publish a similar report for use in the climate resiliency and mitigation surcharge rate determination under subsection (1)(b) of this section by assessing the adjusted fossil fuel financing, as a percentage of total financing for all industries, for each specified financial institution's consolidated financial institution group, for the prior calendar year. The report published under this subsection (3)(b) must be used to set the rate under subsection (1)(b) of this section, as adjusted under subsection (1)(c) of this section, for fiscal year 2025 and thereafter.

4. The surcharge collected under this section must be deposited into the climate resiliency account in RCW 43.79.545.

5. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

    a. "Adjusted fossil fuel financing" means league table credit for financing fossil fuel companies less league table credit for financing renewable energy companies.

        ii. If financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements, "specified financial institution" means any person that was subject to the additional tax in this section in at least two of the previous four calendar years.

3. The department must notify the fiscal committees of the legislature if financial institutions are no longer required to file consolidated financial statements.

4. To aid in the effective administration of the additional tax imposed in this section, the department may require a person believed to be a specified financial institution to disclose whether it is a member of a consolidated financial institution group and, if so, to identify all other members of its consolidated financial institution group. A person failing to comply with this subsection is deemed to have intended to evade tax payable under this section and is subject to the penalty in RCW 82.32.090(7) on any tax due under this section by the person and any financial institution affiliated with the person.

5. Taxes collected under this section must be deposited into the general fund.
