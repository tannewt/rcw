2. Every employer who does not require employees or contractors to wear a specific type of personal protective equipment must accommodate its employee's or contractor's voluntary use of that specific type of protective device or equipment, including gloves, goggles, face shields, and face masks, as the employee or contractor deems necessary.

3. The provisions of subsection (2) of this section applies only when:

    a. The voluntary use of these protective devices and equipment does not introduce hazards to the work environment and is consistent with the provisions of this chapter and corresponding rules established by the department as of the effective date of this section;

    b. The use of facial coverings does not interfere with an employer's security requirements; and

    c. The voluntary use of these protective devices and equipment does not conflict with standards for that specific type of equipment established by the department of health or the department.

4. An employer may verify that voluntary use of personal protective equipment meets all regulatory requirements for workplace health and safety.

5. An employer may not apply to the director of the department, under RCW 49.17.080, for a temporary order granting a variance from this subsection.
