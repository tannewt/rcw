# Senate Bill 5397

[Source](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5397.pdf)
## Section 1
The legislature finds that involuntary treatment is a safety net service for adults and children experiencing a behavioral health crisis in Washington, some of whom experience anosognosia, a condition in which a person is unaware of having a brain disease. Washington law requires managed care organizations and behavioral health administrative services organizations to provide an adequate network of involuntary treatment services under RCW 71.24.045 and 71.24.490. This safety net is undermined when facilities decline to admit certain persons despite having certified treatment capacity available. This legislation provides a means to collect information about why persons in crisis who are denied admission into facilities with available capacity and a means to enlist managed care organizations and behavioral health administrative services organizations to support placement efforts for persons in crisis.


## Section 2
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [71.05](/rcw/71_mental_illness/71.05_mental_illness.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/71_mental_illness/71.05_mental_illness.md) for context.

1. An evaluation and treatment facility or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility that has treatment capacity available shall admit a person who has been detained for inpatient treatment at the request of the designated crisis responder unless:

    a. The person requires medical services not generally available at a facility certified under this chapter;

    b. A more appropriate facility exists to serve the specific needs of the person that has agreed to admit the person;

    c. Unusual reasons specific to the person or to their prior relationship with the facility exist that make the facility unable to admit the person; or

    d. The services offered by the facility are targeted for a specific population and the person is not among that specific population and therefore is not appropriate for admission.

2. An evaluation and treatment facility or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility that has treatment capacity available shall admit a person who is receiving temporary services under a single bed certification upon application for transfer by the facility when the attending physician considers the person medically stable unless an exception under subsection (1) of this section applies.

3. An evaluation and treatment facility or secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility which declines to admit a person after receiving a request under subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall document receiving the request and the statutorily permitted reason for declining admission with a brief explanation in its records and immediately provide a copy to the designated crisis responder or facility providing services under a single bed certification.

1. When a designated crisis responder, or a facility providing services under a single bed certification seeking to transfer the patient to a certified facility, is unable to find a placement for a detained person, and the designated crisis responder or facility has obtained at least two denials of admission under section 2 of this act, the designated crisis responder or facility shall immediately transmit notification to the managed care organization responsible for the cost of the person's care, or if not enrolled in a managed care organization the behavioral health administrative services organization, in the manner prescribed by the organization, of the need for emergency intervention to secure access to crisis services for the person.

3. A managed care organization or behavioral health administrative services organization that receives notice under subsection (1) of this section shall obtain a placement or safe discharge for the person within the 24-hour emergency hold period. The managed care organization or behavioral health administrative services organization may share information and coordinate with other public or private entities, if any, that provide coverage to the person. If the managed care organization or behavioral health administrative services organization is unable to obtain a placement or safe discharge for the person during the emergency hold period, the hold shall dissolve, and the managed care organization or behavioral health administrative services organization shall make a report under RCW 71.05.750.
