## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [4.24.420](/rcw/04_civil_procedure/4.024_special_rights_of_action_and_special_immunities.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/04_civil_procedure/4.024_special_rights_of_action_and_special_immunities.md) for context.

It is a complete defense to any action for damages for personal injury or wrongful death that the person injured or killed **has been convicted** of a **class A or a class B** felony **the commission of which** was a proximate cause of the injury or death. However, nothing in this section shall affect a right of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.


## Section 2
This act is remedial and applies retroactively to all claims or causes of action commenced prior to or after the effective date of this section regardless of when the claim or cause of action arose.
