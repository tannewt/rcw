## Section 1
> This section adds a new section to an existing chapter [81.53](/rcw/81_transportation/81.053_railroads—crossings.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/81_transportation/81.053_railroads—crossings.md) for context.

1. Railroad companies shall not block a railroad grade crossing, upon the request of law enforcement or other emergency services personnel, or when any member of the crew becomes aware that the crossing is being approached by a law enforcement or other emergency services vehicle with its emergency lights flashing or that such a vehicle is stopped with its emergency lights flashing at the crossing blocked by the train.

2. A railroad grade crossing must be cleared by the fastest available method so long as the train movement will not violate rules issued by the federal railroad administration.

3. A railroad that violates this section is subject to the provisions of RCW 81.04.380.
