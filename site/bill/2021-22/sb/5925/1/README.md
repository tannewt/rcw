## Section 1
1. The legislature finds that time outdoors helps children thrive physically, emotionally, and academically, yet over the past few generations, childhood has moved indoors. On average, today's kids spend up to 44 hours per week in front of a screen, and less than 10 minutes a day doing activities outdoors. For too many kids, access to the outdoors is determined by race, income, ability, and zip code. All children deserve equitable access to outdoor spaces where they can learn, play, and grow. Current access to outdoor school is inequitable mostly due to funding and administrative constraints.

2. From stress reduction to improved focus and engagement to better academic performance, outdoor-based learning helps kids thrive. Research shows participants in outdoor school have higher graduation rates, improved behavior in school and relationships with peers, higher academic achievement, critical thinking skills, direct experience of scientific concepts in the field, leadership and collaboration skills, and a deeper engagement with learning, place, and community. Outdoor school also offers new opportunities for career connected learning in science, natural resources, education, land management, agriculture, outdoor recreation, and other employment sectors. Outdoor school can also be a key element in the larger system of regular outdoor instructional time and outdoor experiences that includes STEM fields, after-school programs, summer camps, 4-H, scouting, and related programs that can spark a lifelong appreciation for the natural world.

3. The legislature further finds that accessibility is a major obstacle to universal outdoor school. Most sites lack accommodation for children with disabilities and support staff for children who need social and emotional support. In addition, some youth may experience cultural barriers to outdoor school experiences. The legislature intends to establish a statewide program to address all these needs and to ensure all students have a chance to benefit from outdoor school.


## Section 2

The program will consist of hands-on outdoor school experiences that are three to five days and zero to four nights, residential or day programs, and have a focus on environmental education aligned with the Washington state learning standards and the development of social and emotional learning skills.

    b. School districts and outdoor school providers should ensure equitable access for students in all geographic regions and high levels of accessibility for students with disabilities.

5. The office of the superintendent of public instruction will submit an annual report, beginning in 2024, to the appropriate committees of the legislature with an evaluation of the outdoor school for all program and may include reporting on all outdoor education and instructional time efforts and how they integrate with the outdoor school for all program.
