## Section 1
> This section modifies existing section [49.12.250](/rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.12_industrial_welfare.md). Here is the [modified chapter](rcw/49_labor_regulations/49.12_industrial_welfare.md) for context.

1. **Within 14 calendar days of a request by an employee, former employee, or their attorney, agent, or fiduciary, each** employer **must furnish to the employee a complete, unredacted electronic or paper copy of the employee's personnel** file(s) **at no cost to the employee**.

2. An employee annually may petition that the employer review all information in the employee's personnel file(s)  or are subject to reference for information given to persons outside of the company. The employer shall determine if there is any irrelevant or erroneous information in the file(s), and shall remove all such information from the file(s). If an employee does not agree with the employer's determination, the employee may at his or her request have placed in the employee's personnel file a statement containing the employee's rebuttal or correction. Nothing in this subsection prevents the employer from removing information more frequently.

3. A former employee shall retain the right of rebuttal or correction for a period not to exceed two years.

4. **Every employer shall, within 14 business days of receiving a written request by a former employee, or their attorney, agent, or fiduciary, furnish a signed written statement to the employee stating the reasons for and effective date of discharge.**

5. **An employee may enforce this section through a private cause of action in superior court, without exhausting any administrative remedies, and for each violation will be entitled to equitable relief, statutory damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs. The statutory damages for each violation shall be: $250 if the file or statement is not provided within 14 days from the due date; $500 if the file or statement is not provided within 28 days from the due date; and $1,000 if the file or statement is provided later than 28 days from the due date.**

7. **This section may not be construed to create a retention schedule for records or to entitle an employee to an employer's protected legal file.**

8. **Agents and fiduciaries must provide the document evidencing their legal authority to represent the employee or former employee at the time of any request.**

9. **A public employer may redact information before sending the copy of the personnel file if required by law. The public employer must provide the reasons for any redaction and the supporting laws when furnishing the file.**
