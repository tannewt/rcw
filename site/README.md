# wa-law.org

Welcome to wa-law.org. Our goals is to make the Washington State laws better formatted, better crosslinked and more shareable. This copy of the laws is unofficial so please check official sources as needed. Most pages will link to official sources.

## Sections

* [Revised Code of Washington](rcw/)
* [All Bills](bill/)
* [House of Representatives](house/)
* [Senate](senate/)

## Develop

Most of the Markdown files are auto-generated, so fixes should be done on the tools that generate them (in `tools/`) rather than on the Markdown files themselves.
