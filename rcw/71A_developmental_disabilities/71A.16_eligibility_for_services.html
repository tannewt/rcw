<li>
<p>It is the intention of the legislature in this chapter to establish a single point of referral for persons with developmental disabilities and their families so that they may have a place of entry and continuing contact for services authorized under this title to persons with developmental disabilities. Eligible persons with developmental disabilities, whether they live in the community or residential habilitation centers, should have the opportunity to choose where they live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until June 30, 2003, and subject to subsection (3) of this section, if there is a vacancy in a residential habilitation center, the department shall offer admittance to the center to any eligible adult, or eligible adolescent on an exceptional case-by-case basis, with developmental disabilities if his or her assessed needs require the funded level of resources that are provided by the center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall not offer a person admittance to a residential habilitation center under subsection (2) of this section unless the department also offers the person appropriate community support services listed in RCW 71A.12.040.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community support services offered under subsection (3) of this section may only be offered using funds specifically designated for this purpose in the state operating budget. When these funds are exhausted, the department may not offer admittance to a residential habilitation center, or community support services under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to create an entitlement to state services for persons with developmental disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsections (2) through (6) of this section expire June 30, 2003.</p>

<p>A person is eligible for services under this title if the secretary finds that the person has a developmental disability as defined in RCW 71A.10.020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary may adopt rules further defining and implementing the criteria in the definition of &quot;developmental disability&quot; under RCW 71A.10.020. Beginning July 1, 2025, the administration may not use intelligence quotient scores as a determinant of developmental disability. The administration shall maintain eligibility for the administration's services for any persons determined eligible after the age of 18 who were determined eligible using an intelligence quotient score under criteria in place prior to July 1, 2025. The administration shall not disenroll any client upon review at 18 years old who is determined to be eligible based on standards in place prior to or after July 1, 2025.</p>

<p>On receipt of an application for services submitted under RCW 71A.16.030, the secretary in a timely manner shall make a written determination as to whether the applicant is eligible for services provided under this title for persons with developmental disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secretary shall give notice of the secretary's determination on eligibility to the person who submitted the application and to the applicant, if the applicant is a person other than the person who submitted the application for services.

<p>The determination made under this chapter is only as to whether a person is eligible for services. After the secretary has determined under this chapter that a person is eligible for services, the individual may request an assessment for eligibility for medicaid programs and specific services administered by the developmental disabilities administration. The secretary shall make a determination as to what services are appropriate for the person. The secretary shall prioritize services to medicaid eligible clients. Services may be made available to nonmedicaid eligible clients based on available funding. Services available through the state medicaid plan must be provided to those individuals who meet the eligibility criteria. The department shall establish and maintain a service request list database for individuals who are found to be eligible and have an assessed and unmet need for programs and services offered under a home and community-based services waiver, but the provision of a specific service would exceed the biennially budgeted capacity.</p>
