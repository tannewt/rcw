<p>The legislature finds and declares that the sale and offering for sale of land or of interests in associations which provide for the use or occupancy of land touches and affects a great number of the citizens of this state and that full and complete disclosure to prospective purchasers of pertinent information concerning land developments, including any encumbrances or liens attached to the land and the physical characteristics of the development is essential. The legislature further finds and declares that delivery to prospective purchasers of a complete and accurate public offering statement is necessary in order to adequately protect both the economic and physical welfare of the citizens of this state. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the reasonable regulation of the sale and offering for sale of any interest in significant land developments within or without the state of Washington, so that the prospective purchasers of such interests might be provided with full, complete, and accurate information of all pertinent circumstances affecting their purchase.</p>
