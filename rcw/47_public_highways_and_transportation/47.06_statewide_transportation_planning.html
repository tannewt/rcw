<p>The legislature recognizes that the ownership and operation of Washington's transportation system is spread among federal, state, and local government agencies, regional transit agencies, port districts, and the private sector. The legislature also recognizes that transportation planning authority is shared on the local, regional, and state levels, and that this planning must be a comprehensive and coordinated effort. While significant authority for transportation planning is vested with local agencies and regional transportation planning organizations under the growth management act, the legislature recognizes that certain transportation issues and facilities cross local and regional boundaries and are vital to the statewide economy and the cross-state mobility of people and goods. Therefore, the state has an appropriate role in developing statewide transportation plans that address state jurisdiction facilities and services as well as transportation facilities and services of state interest. These plans shall serve as a guide for short-term investment needs and provide a long-range vision for transportation system development.</p>

<p>The specific role of the department in transportation planning must be, consistent with the policy goals described under RCW 47.04.280: (1) Ongoing coordination and development of statewide transportation policies that guide all Washington transportation providers; (2) ongoing development of a statewide multimodal transportation plan that includes both state-owned and state-interest facilities and services; (3) coordinating the state high capacity transportation planning and regional transportation planning programs; (4) conducting special transportation planning studies that impact state transportation facilities or relate to transportation facilities and services of statewide significance; and (5) assisting the transportation commission in the development of the statewide transportation plan required under RCW 47.01.071(4). Specific requirements for each of these state transportation planning components are described in this chapter.</p>

<p>The department shall develop a statewide multimodal transportation plan under *RCW 47.01.071(3) and in conformance with federal requirements, to ensure the continued mobility of people and goods within regions and across the state in a safe, cost-effective manner. The statewide multimodal transportation plan shall consist of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A state-owned facilities component, which shall guide state investment for state highways including bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and state ferries; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A state-interest component, which shall define the state interest in aviation, marine ports and navigation, freight rail, intercity passenger rail, bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways, and public transportation, and recommend actions in coordination with appropriate public and private transportation providers to ensure that the state interest in these transportation modes is met.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The plans developed under each component must be consistent with the state transportation policy plan and with each other, reflect public involvement, be consistent with regional transportation planning, high capacity transportation planning, and local comprehensive plans prepared under chapter 36.70A RCW, and include analysis of intermodal connections and choices. A primary emphasis for these plans shall be the relief of congestion, the preservation of existing investments and downtowns, ability to attract or accommodate planned population, and employment growth, the improvement of traveler safety, the efficient movement of freight and goods, and the improvement and integration of all transportation modes to create a seamless intermodal transportation system for people and goods.</p>
<p>In the development of the statewide multimodal transportation plan, the department shall identify and document potential affected environmental resources, including, but not limited to, wetlands, stormwater runoff, flooding, air quality, fish passage, and wildlife habitat. The department shall conduct its environmental identification and documentation in coordination with all relevant environmental regulatory authorities, including, but not limited to, local governments. The department shall give the relevant environmental regulatory authorities an opportunity to review the department's environmental plans. The relevant environmental regulatory authorities shall provide comments on the department's environmental plans in a timely manner. Environmental identification and documentation as provided for in RCW 47.01.300 and this section is not intended to create a private right of action or require an environmental impact statement as provided in chapter 43.21C RCW.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The state highway system plan, which identifies program and financing needs and recommends specific and financially realistic improvements to preserve the structural integrity of the state highway system, ensure acceptable operating conditions, and provide for enhanced access to scenic, recreational, and cultural resources. The state highway system plan shall contain the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A system preservation element, which shall establish structural preservation objectives for the state highway system including bridges, identify current and future structural deficiencies based upon analysis of current conditions and projected future deterioration, and recommend program funding levels and specific actions necessary to preserve the structural integrity of the state highway system consistent with adopted objectives. Lowest life-cycle cost methodologies must be used in developing a pavement management system. This element shall serve as the basis for the preservation component of the six-year highway program and the two-year biennial budget request to the legislature;</p>

<p>A capacity and operational improvement element, which shall establish operational objectives, including safety considerations, for moving people and goods on the state highway system, identify current and future capacity, operational, and safety deficiencies, and recommend program funding levels and specific improvements and strategies necessary to achieve the operational objectives. In developing capacity and operational improvement plans the department shall first assess strategies to enhance the operational efficiency of the existing system before recommending system expansion. Strategies to enhance the operational efficiencies include but are not limited to access management, transportation system management, demand management, and high occupancy vehicle facilities. The capacity and operational improvement element must conform to the state implementation plan for air quality and be consistent with regional transportation plans adopted under chapter 47.80 RCW, and shall serve as the basis for the capacity and operational improvement portions of the six-year highway program and the two-year biennial budget request to the legislature;</p>

<li>
<p>The department of transportation, in consultation with local governments, shall set level of service standards for state highways and state ferry routes of statewide significance. Although the department shall consult with local governments when setting level of service standards, the department retains authority to make final decisions regarding level of service standards for state highways and state ferry routes of statewide significance. In establishing level of service standards for state highways and state ferry routes of statewide significance, the department shall consider the necessary balance between providing for the free interjurisdictional movement of people and goods and the needs of local communities using these facilities. When setting the level of service standards under this section for state ferry routes, the department may allow for a standard that is adjustable for seasonality.</p>
