<p>The legislature declares that competent operation of a public water system is necessary for the protection of the consumers' health, and therefore it is of vital interest to the public. In order to protect the public health and conserve and protect the water resources of the state, it is necessary to provide for the classifying of all public water systems; to require the examination and certification of the persons responsible for the technical operation of such systems; and to provide for the promulgation of rules and regulations to carry out this chapter.</p>

<p>A public water system shall have a certified operator if:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>It is a group A water system; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a public water system using a surface water source or a groundwater source under the direct influence of surface water.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The certified operators shall be in charge of the technical direction of a water system's operation, or an operating shift of such a system, or a major segment of a system necessary for monitoring or improving the quality of water. The operator shall be certified as provided in RCW 70A.120.050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A certified operator may provide required services to more than one system or to a group of systems. The amount of time that a certified operator shall be required to be present at any given system shall be based upon the time required to properly operate and maintain the public water system as designed and constructed in accordance with RCW 43.20.050. The employing or appointing officials shall designate the position or positions requiring mandatory certification within their individual systems and shall assure that such certified operators are responsible for the system's technical operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall, in establishing by rule or otherwise the requirements for public water systems with fewer than one hundred connections, phase in such requirements in order to assure that (a) an adequate number of certified operators are available to serve the additional systems, (b) the systems have adequate notice and time to plan for securing the services of a certified operator, (c) the department has the additional data and other administrative capacity, (d) adequate training is available to certify additional operators as necessary, and (e) any additional requirements under federal law are satisfied. The department shall require certified operators for all group A systems as necessary to conform to federal law or implementing rules or guidelines. Unless necessary to conform to federal law, rules, or guidelines, the department shall not require a certified operator for a system with fewer than one hundred connections unless that system is determined by the department to be in significant noncompliance with operational, monitoring, or water quality standards that would put the public health at risk, as defined by the department by rule, or has, or is required to have, water treatment facilities other than simple disinfection.</p>
