<p>The legislature finds that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hood Canal and other marine waters in Puget Sound are at risk of severe loss of marine life from low-dissolved oxygen. The increased input of human-influenced nutrients, especially nitrogen, is a factor causing this low-dissolved oxygen condition in some of Puget Sound's waters, in addition to such natural factors as poor overall water circulation and stratification that discourages mixing of surface-to-deeper waters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant portion of the state's residents live in homes served by on-site sewage disposal systems, and many new residences will be served by these systems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properly functioning on-site sewage disposal systems largely protect water quality. However, improperly functioning on-site sewage disposal systems in marine recovery areas may contaminate surface water, causing public health problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local programs designed to identify and correct failing on-site sewage disposal systems have proven effective in reducing and eliminating public health hazards, improving water quality, and reopening previously closed shellfish areas; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State water quality monitoring data and analysis can help to focus these enhanced local programs on specific geographic areas that are sources of pollutants degrading Puget Sound waters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to authorize enhanced local programs in marine recovery areas to inventory existing on-site sewage disposal systems, to identify the location of all on-site sewage disposal systems in marine recovery areas, to require inspection of on-site sewage disposal systems and repairs to failing systems, to develop electronic data systems capable of sharing information regarding on-site sewage disposal systems, and to monitor these programs to ensure that they are working to protect public health and Puget Sound water quality.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Board&quot; means the state board of health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Department&quot; means the department of health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Failing&quot; means a condition of an existing on-site sewage disposal system or component that threatens the public health by inadequately treating sewage, or by creating a potential for direct or indirect contact between sewage and the public. Examples of a failing on-site sewage disposal system include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Sewage on the surface of the ground;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sewage backing up into a structure caused by slow soil absorption of septic tank effluent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sewage leaking from a sewage tank or collection system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cesspools or seepage pits where evidence of groundwater or surface water quality degradation exists;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inadequately treated effluent contaminating groundwater or surface water; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noncompliance with standards stipulated on the permit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Local health officer&quot; or &quot;local health jurisdiction&quot; means the local health officers and local health jurisdictions in the following counties bordering Puget Sound: Clallam, Island, Kitsap, Jefferson, Mason, San Juan, Seattle-King, Skagit, Snohomish, Tacoma-Pierce, Thurston, and Whatcom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Marine recovery area&quot; means an area of definite boundaries where the local health officer, or the department in consultation with the health officer, determines that additional requirements for existing on-site sewage disposal systems may be necessary to reduce potential failing systems or minimize negative impacts of on-site sewage disposal systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Marine recovery area on-site strategy&quot; or &quot;on-site strategy&quot; means a local health jurisdiction's on-site sewage disposal system strategy required under RCW 70A.110.050. This strategy is a component of the on-site program management plan required under RCW 70A.110.030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;On-site sewage disposal system&quot; means an integrated system of components, located on or nearby the property it serves, that conveys, stores, treats, or provides subsurface soil treatment and dispersal of sewage. It consists of a collection system, a treatment component or treatment sequence, and a soil dispersal component. An on-site sewage disposal system also refers to a holding tank sewage system or other system that does not have a soil dispersal component. For purposes of this chapter, the term &quot;on-site sewage disposal system&quot; does not include any system regulated by a water quality discharge permit issued under chapter 90.48 RCW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Unknown system&quot; means an on-site sewage disposal system that was installed without the knowledge or approval of the local health jurisdiction, including those that were installed before such approval was required.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Marine waters that are listed by the department of ecology under section 303(d) of the federal clean water act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1251 et seq.) for low-dissolved oxygen or fecal coliform; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marine waters where nitrogen has been identified as a contaminant of concern by the local health officer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the boundaries for a marine recovery area, the local health officer shall assess and include those land areas where existing on-site sewage disposal systems may affect water quality in the marine recovery area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determinations made by the local health officer under this section, including identification of nitrogen as a contaminant of concern, will be based on published guidance developed by the department. The guidance must be designed to ensure the proper use of available scientific and technical data. The health officer shall document the basis for these determinations when plans are submitted to the department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After July 1, 2007, the local health officer may designate additional marine recovery areas meeting the criteria of this section, according to new information.
