<p>The legislature finds that land disposal and incineration of solid and hazardous waste can be both harmful to the environment and costly to those who must dispose of the waste. In order to address this problem in the most cost-effective and environmentally sound manner, and to implement the highest waste management priority as articulated in RCW 70A.205.005 and 70A.300.260, public and private efforts should focus on reducing the generation of waste. Waste reduction can be achieved by encouraging voluntary efforts to redesign industrial, commercial, production, and other processes to result in the reduction or elimination of waste by-products and to maximize the in-process reuse or reclamation of valuable spent material.</p>
<p>In the interest of protecting the public health, safety, and the environment, the legislature declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage reduction in the use of hazardous substances and reduction in the generation of hazardous waste whenever economically and technically practicable.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that hazardous wastes are generated by numerous different sources including, but not limited to, large and small business, households, and state and local government. The legislature further finds that a goal against which efforts at waste reduction may be measured is essential for an effective hazardous waste reduction program. The Pacific Northwest hazardous waste advisory council has endorsed a goal of reducing, through hazardous substance use reduction and waste reduction techniques, the generation of hazardous waste by fifty percent by 1995. The legislature adopts this as a policy goal for the state of Washington. The legislature recognizes that many individual businesses have already reduced the generation of hazardous waste through appropriate hazardous waste reduction techniques. The legislature also recognizes that there are some basic industrial processes which by their nature have limited potential for significantly reducing the use of certain raw materials or substantially reducing the generation of hazardous wastes. Therefore, the goal of reducing hazardous waste generation by fifty percent cannot be applied as a regulatory requirement.</p>

<p>The legislature finds and declares that the buildings and facilities owned and leased by state government produce significant amounts of solid and hazardous wastes, and actions must be taken to reduce and recycle these wastes and thus reduce the costs associated with their disposal. In order for the operations of state government to provide the citizens of the state an example of positive waste management, the legislature further finds and declares that state government should undertake an aggressive program designed to reduce and recycle solid and hazardous wastes produced in the operations of state buildings and facilities to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p>The office of waste reduction, in cooperation with the department of enterprise services, shall establish an intensive waste reduction and recycling program to promote the reduction of waste produced by state agencies and to promote the source separation and recovery of recyclable and reusable materials.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Each hazardous waste generator who generates more than two thousand six hundred forty pounds of hazardous waste per year and each hazardous substance user, except for those facilities that are primarily permitted treatment, storage, and disposal facilities or recycling facilities, shall prepare a plan for the voluntary reduction of the use of hazardous substances and the generation of hazardous wastes. Hazardous waste generated and recycled for beneficial use, including initial amount of hazardous substances introduced into a process and subsequently recycled for beneficial use, shall not be used in the calculation of hazardous waste generated for purposes of this section. The department may develop reporting requirements, consistent with existing reporting, to establish recycling for beneficial use under this section. Used oil to be rerefined or burned for energy or heat recovery shall not be used in the calculation of hazardous wastes generated for purposes of this section, and is not required to be addressed by plans prepared under this section. A person with multiple interrelated facilities where the processes in the facilities are substantially similar, may prepare a single plan covering one or more of those facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each user or generator required to write a plan is encouraged to advise its employees of the planning process and solicit comments or suggestions from its employees on hazardous substance use and waste reduction options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department shall adopt by April 1, 1991, rules for preparation of plans. The rules shall require the plan to address the following options, according to the following order of priorities: Hazardous substance use reduction, waste reduction, recycling, and treatment. In the planning process, first consideration shall be given to hazardous substance use reduction and waste reduction options. Consideration shall be given next to recycling options. Recycling options may be considered only after hazardous substance use reduction options and waste reduction options have been thoroughly researched and shown to be inappropriate. Treatment options may be considered only after hazardous substance use reduction, waste reduction, and recycling options have been thoroughly researched and shown to be inappropriate. Documentation of the research shall be available to the department upon request. The rules shall also require the plans to discuss the hazardous substance use reduction, waste reduction, and closed loop recycling options separately from other recycling and treatment options. All plans shall be written in conformance with the format prescribed in the rules adopted under this section. The rules shall require the plans to include, but not be limited to:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>Plans developed under RCW 70A.214.110 shall be retained at the facility of the hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator preparing a plan. The plan is not a public record under the public records act, chapter 42.56 RCW. A user or generator required to prepare a plan shall permit the director or a representative of the director to review the plan to determine its adequacy. No visit made by the director or a representative of the director to a facility for the purposes of this subsection may be regarded as an inspection or investigation, and no notices or citations may be issued, nor any civil penalty assessed, upon such a visit.</p>

<p>If a hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator fails to complete an adequate plan, executive summary, or annual progress report, the department shall notify the user or generator of the inadequacy, identifying specific deficiencies. For the purposes of this section, a deficiency may include failure to develop a plan, failure to submit an executive summary pursuant to the schedule provided in RCW 70A.214.110(5), and failure to submit an annual progress report pursuant to the rules developed under RCW 70A.214.110(6).

<p>If, after having received a list of specified deficiencies from the department, a hazardous substance user or hazardous waste generator required to prepare a plan fails to complete modification of a plan, executive summary, or annual progress report within the time period specified by the department, the department may enter an order pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW finding the user or generator not in compliance with the requirements of RCW 70A.214.110. When the order is final, the department shall notify the department of revenue to charge a penalty fee. The penalty fee shall be the greater of one thousand dollars or three times the amount of the user's or generator's previous year's fee, in addition to the current year's fee. If no fee was assessed the previous year, the penalty shall be the greater of one thousand dollars or three times the amount of the current year's fee.
