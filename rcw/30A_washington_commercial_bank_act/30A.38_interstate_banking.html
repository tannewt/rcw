<p>In the event that the responsible federal chartering authority, pursuant to applicable federal law, or in the event a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any Washington state law is invalid with respect to an out-of-state or national bank, that Washington state law is also invalid with respect to Washington state banks and to host branches of out-of-state state banks to that same extent.

This subsection does not impair, in any manner, the authority of the state attorney general to enforce antitrust laws applicable to banks, bank holding companies, or affiliates of those banks or bank holding companies.</p>
