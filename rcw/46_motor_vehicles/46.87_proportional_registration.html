</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Apportionable vehicle&quot; has the meaning given by the IRP, except that it does not include vehicles with a declared gross weight of twelve thousand pounds or less.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Declared gross weight&quot; means the total unladen weight of any vehicle plus the maximum weight of the load to be carried on the vehicle as declared by the registrant. In the case of a bus, auto stage, or a passenger-carrying for hire vehicle with a seating capacity of more than six, the declared gross weight is determined by multiplying one hundred fifty pounds by the number of seats in the vehicle, including the driver's seat, and adding this amount to the unladen weight of the vehicle. If the resultant gross weight is not listed in RCW 46.17.355, it must be increased to the next higher gross weight authorized in chapter 46.44 RCW.</p>

<p>Owners of rental trailers and semitrailers over six thousand pounds gross vehicle weight used solely in pool fleets must fully register a portion of the pool fleet in this state. To determine the percentage of total fleet vehicles that must be registered in this state, divide the gross revenue received in the reporting period for the use of the rental vehicles arising from rental transactions occurring in this state by the total revenue received in the reporting period for the use of the rental vehicles arising from rental transactions in all jurisdictions in which the vehicles are operated. Apply the resulting percentage to the total number of vehicles that must be registered in this state. Vehicles registered in this state must be representative of the vehicles in the fleet according to age, size, and value.</p>

<li>
<p>When application to register a vehicle in an existing fleet is made, the Washington apportioned fees must be reduced by one-twelfth for each full month that has elapsed from the time an application for registration is received in the department. The prorate percentage previously established for the fleet must be used in the computation of the apportionable fees and taxes due.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a vehicle is withdrawn from a fleet during the period it is registered under this chapter, the registrant of the fleet must notify the department on forms prescribed by the department. The department may require the registrant to surrender credentials issued to the vehicle. If a vehicle is completely removed from the service of the fleet, the unused portion of the license fee paid under RCW 46.17.355, reduced by one-twelfth for each month and fraction thereof elapsing between the first day of the month of the current registration year and the date the notice of removal is received in the department, must be credited to the registrant's fleet proportional registration account. Credit must be applied against the license fee liability for subsequent additions of vehicles to the fleet during the registration year or for additional license fees due under RCW 46.17.355 or be due upon audit under RCW 46.87.310. If any credit is less than fifteen dollars, the credit must not be entered. In lieu of credit, the registrant may transfer the unused portion of the license fee for the vehicle to the new owner, in which case it must remain with the vehicle for which it was originally paid. An amount may not be credited against fees other than those for the registration year from which the credit was obtained and an amount may not be refunded.</p>

Nonapportionable fees required for vehicles of Washington fleets are the administrative fee required under RCW 82.38.075, the vehicle transaction fee pursuant to RCW 46.87.130, and the commercial vehicle safety inspection [enforcement] fee in RCW 46.17.315.</p>

<p>If a person liable for the payment of fees and taxes fails to pay the amount, including any interest and penalty, together with costs incurred, there must be a lien in favor of the state upon all franchises, property, and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to or acquired, whether the property is employed by such person for personal or business use or is in the control of a trustee, receiver, or assignee. The lien is effective from the date fees and taxes were due and payable until the amount is satisfied. The lien has priority over any lien or encumbrance except liens of other fees and taxes having priority by law.</p>

<p>The department must file with any county auditor or other agent a statement of claim and lien specifying the amount of delinquent fees, taxes, penalties, and interest owed.</p>

<p>If a person is delinquent in the payment of any obligation, the department may give notice of the amount of the delinquency, in person or by mail, to persons having possession or control of credits or personal and real property belonging to the person, or owing any debts to the person. Any person notified may not transfer or dispose of credits, personal and real property, or debts without the consent of the department. A person notified must, within twenty days after receipt of the notice, advise the department of any credits, personal and real property, or debts in his or her possession, under his or her control or owing by him or her, and must immediately deliver the credits, personal and real property, or debts to the department.</p>
<p>If a person fails to timely answer the notice, a court may render judgment by default against the person.</p>
<p>The notice and order to withhold and deliver constitutes a continuing lien on property of the person. The department must include in the notice to withhold and deliver &quot;continuing lien.&quot; The effective date of a notice to withhold and deliver is the date of service.</p>

<p>If a person is delinquent in the payment of any obligation, and the delinquency continues after notice and demand for payment, the department must collect the amount due. The department must seize any property subject to the lien of the fees, taxes, penalties, and interest and sell it at public auction. Notice of the intended sale and its time and place must be given to the person and to all persons with an interest in the property. The notice must be published at least ten days before the date set for the sale in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the property will be sold. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, the notice must be posted in three public places in the county for a period of ten days. The notice must contain a description of the property, a statement of the amount due, the name of the person, and a statement that unless the amount due is paid on or before the time in the notice the property will be sold.</p>
<p>The department must sell the property and deliver to the purchaser a bill of sale or deed. If the moneys received exceed the amount due from the person, the excess must be returned to the person with a receipt. If any person having an interest in or lien upon the property has filed notice with the department before the sale, the department must withhold payment of any excess to the person pending determination of the rights of the respective parties by a court of competent jurisdiction. If the receipt of the person is not available, the department must deposit the excess with the state treasurer as trustee for the person or his or her heirs, successors, or assigns.</p>

<p>When an assessment becomes final, the department may file with the clerk of any county within the state a warrant in the amount of fees, taxes, penalties, interest, and a filing fee under RCW 36.18.012(10). The warrant constitutes a lien upon the title to, and interest in, all real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The warrant is sufficient to support the issuance of writs of execution and writs of garnishment in favor of the state.</p>
