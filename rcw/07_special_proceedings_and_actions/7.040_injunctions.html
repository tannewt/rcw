<p>When it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of some act, the commission or continuance of which during the litigation would produce great injury to the plaintiff; or when during the litigation, it appears that the defendant is doing, or threatened, or is about to do, or is procuring, or is suffering some act to be done in violation of the plaintiff's rights respecting the subject of the action tending to render the judgment ineffectual; or where such relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining proceedings upon any final order or judgment, an injunction may be granted to restrain such act or proceedings until the further order of the court, which may afterwards be dissolved or modified upon motion. And where it appears in the complaint at the commencement of the action, or during the pendency thereof, by affidavit, that the defendant threatens, or is about to remove or dispose of his or her property with intent to defraud his or her creditors, a temporary injunction may be granted to restrain the removal or disposition of his or her property.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An action under this section shall be brought in the county in which the unlawful act or acts are alleged to have taken place, and shall be commenced by the filing of a verified complaint, or shall be accompanied by an affidavit.</p>

At the hearing the burden of proof shall be on the complainant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon a finding by the court that the telecommunications device is being used or has been used in violation of RCW 9.26A.110 or 9.26A.115, the court may issue an order requiring the telephone company which is rendering service over the device to disconnect such service. Upon receipt of such order, which shall be served upon an officer of the telephone company by the sheriff or deputy of the county in which the telecommunications device is installed, the telephone company shall proceed promptly to disconnect and remove such device and discontinue all telephone service until further order of the court, provided that the telephone company may do so without breach of the peace or trespass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The telecommunications company that petitions the court for the removal of any telecommunications device under this section shall be a necessary party to any proceeding or action arising out of or under RCW 9.26A.110 or 9.26A.115.</p>

<li>
<p>Property seized pursuant to the direction of the court that the court has determined to have been used in violation of RCW 9.26A.110 or 9.26A.115 shall be forfeited after notice and hearing. The court may remit or mitigate the forfeiture upon terms and conditions as the court deems reasonable if it finds that such forfeiture was incurred without gross negligence or without any intent of the petitioner to violate the law, or it finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify the remission or the mitigation of the forfeiture. In determining whether to remit or mitigate forfeiture, the court shall consider losses that may have been suffered by victims as the result of the use of the forfeited property.</p>
