<li>
<p>If RCW 26.21A.560 does not apply, upon petition a tribunal of this state may modify a child support order issued in another state which is registered in this state if, after notice and hearing the tribunal finds that:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>The following requirements are met:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual, nor the obligor resides in the issuing state;</p>

<li>
<p>A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or</p>

</li>

<p>This state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.</p>

<p>A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support.

</li>
<li>
<p>In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, a tribunal of this state shall recognize and enforce a registered convention support order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following grounds are the only grounds on which a tribunal of this state may refuse recognition and enforcement of a registered convention support order:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Recognition and enforcement of the order is manifestly incompatible with public policy, including the failure of the issuing tribunal to observe minimum standards of due process, which include notice and an opportunity to be heard;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction consistent with RCW 26.21A.100;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order is not enforceable in the issuing country;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order was obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A record transmitted in accordance with RCW 26.21A.613 lacks authenticity or integrity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proceeding between the same parties and having the same purpose is pending before a tribunal of this state and that proceeding was the first to be filed;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order is incompatible with a more recent support order involving the same parties and having the same purpose if the more recent support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under this chapter in this state;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment, to the extent alleged arrears have been paid in whole or in part;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a case in which the respondent neither appeared nor was represented in the proceeding in the issuing foreign country:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the law of that country provides for prior notice of proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the law of that country does not provide for prior notice of the proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the order and an opportunity to be heard in a challenge or appeal on fact or law before a tribunal; or</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order was made in violation of RCW 26.21A.625.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a tribunal of this state does not recognize a convention support order under subsection (2)(b), (d), or (i) of this section:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The tribunal may not dismiss the proceeding without allowing a reasonable time for a party to request the establishment of a new convention support order; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department of social and health services shall take all appropriate measures to request a child support order for the obligee if the application for recognition and enforcement was received under RCW 26.21A.607.</p>

<p>The governor of this state may:</p>

<li>
<p>Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least sixty days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail.</p>

<li>
<p>If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.</p>
