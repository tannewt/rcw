<ol>
<li>
<p>A Canadian domestic violence protection order that identifies both a protected individual and a respondent and appears valid on its face is prima facie evidence of its enforceability under chapter 215, Laws of 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Canadian domestic violence protection order is enforceable only to the extent it prohibits a respondent from the following conduct as ordered by a Canadian court:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Being in physical proximity to a protected individual or following a protected individual;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directly or indirectly contacting or communicating with a protected individual or other individual described in the order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being within a certain distance of a specified place or location associated with a protected individual; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Molesting, annoying, harassing, or engaging in threatening conduct directed at a protected individual.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither filing with the clerk of the court under RCW 26.55.040 nor obtaining an order granting recognition and enforcement under RCW 26.55.030 is required prior to the enforcement of a Canadian domestic violence protection order by a law enforcement officer.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If a law enforcement officer determines under subsection (2) or (3) of this section that there is probable cause to believe a Canadian domestic violence protection order exists and that one or more of the provisions of the order identified in RCW 26.55.015 have been violated, the officer shall enforce the terms of the Canadian domestic violence protection order as if the terms were in an order issued in Washington state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presentation to a law enforcement officer of a record of a Canadian domestic violence protection order that identifies both a protected individual and a respondent, and on its face is in effect, constitutes probable cause to believe that an enforceable order exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a record of a Canadian domestic violence protection order is not presented as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a law enforcement officer is not prohibited from considering other relevant information in determining whether there is probable cause to believe that a Canadian domestic violence protection order exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a law enforcement officer determines that a Canadian domestic violence protection order cannot be enforced because the respondent has not been notified of or served with the order, the officer shall notify the protected individual that the officer will make reasonable efforts to contact the respondent, consistent with the safety of the protected individual. After notice to the protected individual and consistent with the safety of the individual, the officer shall make a reasonable effort to inform the respondent of the order, notify the respondent of the terms of the order, provide a record of the order, if available, to the respondent, and allow the respondent a reasonable opportunity to comply with the order before the officer enforces the order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a law enforcement officer determines that an individual is a protected individual, the officer shall inform the individual of available local victim services.</p>

<li>
<p>A protected individual;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person authorized by law of this state other than this chapter to seek enforcement of a domestic violence protection order; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A respondent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petitioner is not required to post a bond to obtain relief in any proceeding under this section. No fees for any type of filing or service of process may be charged by a court or any public agency to petitioners seeking relief under this chapter. Courts may not charge petitioners any fees or surcharges the payment of which is a condition precedent to the petitioner's ability to secure access to relief under this chapter. Petitioners shall be provided the necessary number of certified copies, forms, and instructional brochures free of charge. A respondent who is served electronically with a protection order shall be provided a certified copy of the order free of charge upon request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of the petition, the court shall order a hearing, which shall be held not later than 14 days from the date of the order. Service shall be provided as required in RCW 7.105.080 and 7.105.150 through 7.105.165.</p>

<li>
<p>The respondent was given reasonable notice and had an opportunity to be heard before the court issued the order; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of an ex parte temporary protection order, the respondent was given reasonable notice and had or will have an opportunity to be heard within a reasonable time after the order was issued, in a manner consistent with the right of the respondent to due process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A claim that a Canadian domestic violence protection order does not comply with subsection (6) of this section is an affirmative defense in a proceeding seeking enforcement of the order. If the court determines that the order is not enforceable, the court shall issue an order that the Canadian domestic violence protection order is not enforceable under this section and RCW 26.55.020 and may not be filed under RCW 26.55.040.</p>
