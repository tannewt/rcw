Within ten days after the lead auditor received the petition, the auditors of these other counties shall certify to the lead auditor: (1) The number of voters of that county residing in the area proposed to be withdrawn who voted at the last municipal general election; and (2) the number of valid signatures on the petition of voters of that county residing in the area proposed to be withdrawn. The lead auditor shall certify the sufficiency of the petition after receiving this information.

<p>As an alternative procedure to those set forth in RCW 57.28.010 through 57.28.030, the withdrawal of territory within a district may be commenced by a resolution of the board of commissioners that sets forth boundaries of the territory to be withdrawn and sets a date for the public hearing required under RCW 57.28.050. Upon the final hearing, the board of commissioners shall make such changes in the proposed boundaries as they deem proper, except that no changes in the boundary lines may be made by the board of commissioners to include lands not within the boundaries of the territory as described in such resolution.</p>
<p>Whenever the board of commissioners proposes to commence the withdrawal of any portion of its territory located within a city or town using the alternative procedures herein authorized, it shall first notify such city or town of their [its] intent to withdraw the territory. If the legislative authority of the city or town takes no action within sixty days of receipt of notification, the district may proceed with the resolution method.</p>
<p>If the city or town legislative authority disapproves of use of the alternative procedures, the board of commissioners may proceed using the process established under RCW 57.28.010 through 57.28.030.</p>
<p>A withdrawal procedure commenced under this section shall be subject to the procedures and requirements set forth in RCW 57.28.040 through 57.28.110.</p>

<p>Upon receipt by the board of commissioners of a petition and certificate of sufficiency of the auditor, or if the petition is signed by landowners and the board of commissioners is satisfied as to the sufficiency of the signatures thereon, it shall at a regular or special meeting fix a date for hearing on the petition and give notice that the petition has been filed, stating the time and place of the meeting of the board of commissioners at which the petition will be heard and setting forth the boundaries of the territory proposed to be withdrawn. The notice shall be published at least once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation therein, and if no such newspaper is printed in the county, then in some newspaper of general circulation in the county and district. Any additional notice of the hearing may be given as the board of commissioners may by resolution direct.</p>
<p>Prior to fixing the time for a hearing on any such petition, the board of commissioners in its discretion may require the petitioners to furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned that the petitioners shall pay all costs incurred by the district in connection with the petition, including the cost of an election if one is held pursuant thereto, and should the petitioners fail or refuse to post such a bond, if one is required by the district board of commissioners, then there shall be no duty on the part of the board of commissioners to act upon the petition.</p>

<p>Would such withdrawal be conducive to the general welfare of the balance of the district?</p>
