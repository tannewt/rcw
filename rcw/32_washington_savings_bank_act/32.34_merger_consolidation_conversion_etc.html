</li>
<li>
<p>A savings bank which has converted to the stock form may sell all its assets and transfer all its liabilities upon the affirmative vote or with the written consent of two-thirds of its directors, and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares in each class entitled to vote.</p>

<p>A savings bank that has converted to the stock form may engage in a consolidation or merger upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of its directors, if (a) the transaction is with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the converted savings bank, or (b)(i) the transaction is incident to the establishment of a holding company pursuant to RCW 32.34.040 or 12 U.S.C. Sec. 1467a, (ii) each shareholder will, immediately after the effective date of such transaction, hold the same number of shares of the holding company, with substantially the same designations, preferences, limitations, and rights, as the shares of the converted savings bank that the shareholder held immediately before the effective date, and (iii) the number of authorized shares of the holding company will, immediately after the effective date, be the same as the number of authorized shares of the converted savings bank immediately before the effective date, or (c)(i) the total assets of the converted savings bank, immediately prior to the effective date of the transaction, exceed two-thirds of the assets of the institution that would result from the transaction and (ii) the converted savings bank will survive the transaction without its shareholders surrendering their shares of stock in the converted savings bank.</p>

<p>A savings bank not having capital stock may establish a business trust for the benefit of its depositors, with the approval of the director and subject to such rules as the director may adopt. The director may permit this business trust to become a mutual holding company owning all shares of an interim stock savings bank, the sole purpose of which shall be to merge into the mutual savings bank that formed the business trust. The depositors in an unconverted savings bank which has merged with the subsidiary of such a mutual holding company, in the event of a later conversion of this mutual holding company to the stock form, shall retain all their rights to their deposits in the savings bank, and shall also receive, without payment, nontransferrable rights to subscribe for the stock of the holding company, and rights to a liquidation account maintained by the holding company in proportion to their deposits in the savings bank, to the same extent that they would receive these rights in a stock conversion of the savings bank as prescribed in chapter 32.32 RCW.</p>

<li>
<p>Any holder of shares of a savings bank shall be entitled to receive the value of these shares, as specified in subsection (2) of this section, if (a) the savings bank is voluntarily liquidating, converting to a savings bank without capital stock, being acquired, merging, or consolidating, (b) the shareholder voted, in person or by proxy, against the liquidation, conversion, acquisition, merger, or consolidation, at a meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of voting on such transaction, and (c) the shareholder delivers a written demand for payment, with the stock certificates, to the savings bank within thirty days after such meeting of shareholders. The value of shares shall be paid in cash, within ten days after the later of the effective date of the transaction or the completion of the appraisal as specified in subsection (2) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of such shares shall be determined as of the close of business on the business day before the shareholders' meeting at which the shareholder dissented, by three appraisers, one to be selected by the owners of two-thirds of the dissenting shares, one by the board of directors of the institution that will survive the transaction, and the third by the two so chosen. The valuation agreed upon by any two appraisers shall govern. If such appraisal is not completed by the later of the effective date of the transaction or the thirty-fifth day after receipt of the written demand and stock certificates, the director shall cause an appraisal to be made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dissenting shareholders shall bear, on a pro rata basis based on the number of dissenting shares owned, the cost of their appraisal and one-half of the cost of a third appraisal, and the surviving institution shall bear the cost of its appraisal and one-half the cost of the third appraisal. If the director causes an appraisal to be made, the cost of that appraisal shall be borne equally by the dissenting shareholders and the surviving institution, with the dissenting shareholders sharing their half of the cost on a pro rata basis based on the number of dissenting shares owned.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The institution that is to survive the transaction may fix an amount which it considers to be not more than the fair market value of the shares of a savings bank at the time of the stockholder's meeting approving the transaction, which it will pay dissenting shareholders entitled to payment in cash. The amount due under such accepted offer or under the appraisal shall constitute a debt of the surviving institution.</p>
