<li>
<p>With respect to any collateral acquired by the debtor subsequent to midnight June 30, 1982, any effective financing statement or continuation statement described in this section shall apply only if the filing or filings are in the office or offices that would be appropriate to perfect the security interests in the new collateral under chapter 41, Laws of 1981.</p>

<p>If a security interest is perfected or has priority on midnight June 30, 1982, as to all persons or as to certain persons without any filing or recording, and if the filing of a financing statement would be required for the perfection or priority of the security interest against those persons under the Uniform Commercial Code as amended by chapter 41, Laws of 1981, the perfection and priority rights of the security interest continue until three years after midnight June 30, 1982.

<li>
<p>If a security interest is perfected when the Uniform Commercial Code as amended by chapter 41, Laws of 1981 takes effect under a law other than the Uniform Commercial Code which requires no further filing, refiling or recording to continue its perfection, perfection continues until and will lapse three years after the Uniform Commercial Code as amended by chapter 41, Laws of 1981 takes effect, unless a financing statement is filed as provided in subsection (4) or unless the security interest is perfected otherwise than by filing, or unless under subsection (3) of *RCW 62A.9-302 the other law continues to govern filing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a security interest is perfected by a filing, refiling or recording under a law repealed by chapter 41, Laws of 1981 which required further filing, refiling or recording to continue its perfection, perfection continues and will lapse on the date provided by the law so repealed for such further filing, refiling or recording unless a financing statement is filed as provided in subsection (4) or unless the security interest is perfected otherwise than by filing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A financing statement may be filed within six months before the perfection of a security interest would otherwise lapse. Any such financing statement may be signed by either the debtor or the secured party. It must identify the security agreement, statement or notice (however denominated in any statute or other law repealed or modified by chapter 41, Laws of 1981), state the office where and the date when the last filing, refiling or recording, if any, was made with respect thereto, and the filing number, if any, or book and page, if any, of recording and further state that the security agreement, statement or notice, however denominated, in another filing office under the Uniform Commercial Code or under any statute or other law repealed or modified by chapter 41, Laws of 1981 is still effective. *RCW 62A.9-401 and 62A.9-103 determine the proper place to file such a financing statement. Except as specified in this subsection, the provisions of *RCW 62A.9-403(3) for continuation statements apply to such a financing statement.</p>
