<p>A &quot;usage of trade&quot; is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.</p>
<ol type="a" start="6">
<li>
<p>Subject to RCW 62A.2-209 and 62A.2A-208, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.</p>

<p>A term providing that one party or that party's successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral &quot;at will&quot; or when the party &quot;deems itself insecure,&quot; or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired. The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised.</p>
