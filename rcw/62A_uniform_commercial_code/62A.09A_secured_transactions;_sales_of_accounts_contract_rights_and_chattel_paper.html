<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>Purchase-money security interest in goods. A security interest in goods is a purchase-money security interest:</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that the goods are purchase-money collateral with respect to that security interest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the security interest is in inventory that is or was purchase-money collateral, also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to other inventory in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest; and</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In accordance with any reasonable method of application to which the parties agree;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the absence of the parties' agreement to a reasonable method, in accordance with any intention of the obligor manifested at or before the time of payment; or</p>

<p>The purchase-money collateral also secures an obligation that is not a purchase-money obligation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collateral that is not purchase-money collateral also secures the purchase-money obligation; or</p>

<ol type="a" start="3">
<li>Indexing: General. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, the filing office shall:</li>

<ol type="a" start="5">
<li>Indexing: Real-property-related assignment. If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, the filing office shall index an assignment filed under RCW 62A.9A-514(a) or an amendment filed under RCW 62A.9A-514(b):</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the name of the assignor as grantor; and</p>

<li>
<p>To the extent that the law of this state provides for indexing a record of the assignment of a mortgage under the name of the assignee, under the name of the assignee.</p>
<ol type="a" start="6">

<li>
<p>Timeliness of filing office performance.

<li>
<p>Mandatory refusal to accept record. The filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(2) shall refuse to accept a record for filing for a reason set forth in RCW 62A.9A-516(b). A filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(1) shall refuse to accept a record for filing for a reason set forth in RCW 62A.9A-516(b) (1) through (4) and any filing office may refuse to accept a record for filing only for a reason set forth in RCW 62A.9A-516(b).</p>

<li>
<p>Communication concerning refusal. If a filing office refuses to accept a record for filing, it shall communicate to the person that presented the record the fact of and reason for the refusal and the date and time the record would have been filed had the filing office accepted it. The communication must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule but, in the case of a filing office described in RCW 62A.9A-501(a)(2), in no event more than two business days after the filing office receives the record.</p>

<li>
<p>When filed financing statement effective. A filed financing statement satisfying RCW 62A.9A-502 (a) and (b) is effective, even if the filing office is required to refuse to accept it for filing under subsection (a) of this section. However, RCW 62A.9A-338 applies to a filed financing statement providing information described in RCW 62A.9A-516(b)(5) which is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed.</p>
