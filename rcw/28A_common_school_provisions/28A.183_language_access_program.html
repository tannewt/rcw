<p>The principles of an effective language access program for culturally responsive, systemic family engagement are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Accessibility and equity. Schools provide access to all; two-way communication is a priority and is woven into the design of all programs and services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accountability and transparency. The language access program and decision-making processes at all levels are: Open, accessible, and useable to families; proactive, not reactive; continuously improved based on ongoing feedback from families and staff; and regulated by a clear and just complaint process;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsive culture. Schools are safe, compassionate places where each family's opinions are heard, needs are met, and contributions are valued. School staff are humble and empathetic towards families; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on relationships. Schools seek to relate to families on an individual level, building trust through respectful relationships that recognize the unique strengths that each family and student possesses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
