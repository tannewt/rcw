<p>The legislature finds that the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws has developed uniform legislation called the uniform environmental covenants act. The act ensures that environmental covenants, recorded use restrictions negotiated in connection with hazardous waste site cleanups, and other environmental response projects are legally valid and enforceable. The uniform environmental covenants act achieves this objective by providing clear statutory standards that override court-made doctrines that do not fit such cleanup and reuse contexts. The legislature further finds that nothing in this chapter will amend or modify any local or state laws that determine when environmental covenants are required, when a particular contaminated site must be cleaned up, or the standards for a cleanup.</p>
<p>Adoption of the uniform environmental covenants act in Washington will provide all participants in a cleanup with greater confidence that environmental covenants and other institutional controls will be effective over the life of the cleanup. This will facilitate cleanups of many sites and assist in the recycling of urban brownfield properties into new economic uses for the benefit of the citizens of Washington.</p>
<p>This chapter adopts most provisions of the uniform legislation while making modifications to integrate the uniform environmental covenants act with Washington's environmental cleanup programs.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Any person, including a person that owns an interest in the real property, the agency, or a municipality or other unit of local government, may be a holder. An environmental covenant may identify more than one holder. The interest of a holder is an interest in real property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A right of an agency under this chapter or under an environmental covenant, other than a right as a holder, is not an interest in real property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agency is bound by any obligation it assumes in an environmental covenant, but an agency does not assume obligations merely by signing an environmental covenant. Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound by the obligations the person assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does not change obligations, rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter except as provided in the covenant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following rules apply to interests in real property in existence at the time an environmental covenant is created or amended:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An interest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmental covenant unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate that interest to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenant covering real property or in a separate record. If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a common interest community, the record may be signed by any person authorized by the governing board of the owners' association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental covenant affects the priority of that person's interest but does not by itself impose any affirmative obligation on the person with respect to the environmental covenant.</p>

<p>An environmental covenant must:</p>
<ol type="a">

<p>State that the instrument is an environmental covenant executed pursuant to this chapter;</p>

<li>
<p>Contain a legally sufficient description of the real property subject to the covenant;</p>

<p>Requirements for notice following transfer of a specified interest in, or concerning proposed changes in use of, applications for building permits for, or proposals for any site work affecting the contamination on, the property subject to the covenant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements for periodic reporting describing compliance with the covenant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rights of access to the property granted in connection with implementation or enforcement of the covenant;</p>

<p>Narrative descriptions of the contamination and remedy, including the contaminants of concern, the pathways of exposure, limits on exposure, and the location and extent of the contamination;</p>

</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>In addition to other conditions for its approval of an environmental covenant, the agency may require those persons specified by the agency who have interests in the real property to sign the covenant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agency may also require notice and opportunity to comment upon an environmental covenant as part of public participation efforts related to the environmental response project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agency shall consult with local land use planning authorities in the development of the land use or activity restrictions in the environmental covenant. The agency shall consider potential redevelopment and revitalization opportunities and obtain information regarding present and proposed land and resource uses, and consider comprehensive land use plan and zoning provisions applicable to the real property to be subject to the environmental covenant.</p>
