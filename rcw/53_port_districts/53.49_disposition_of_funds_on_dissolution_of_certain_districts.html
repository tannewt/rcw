<p>Whenever any port district located in any county with a population of from eight thousand to less than twelve thousand shall be dissolved and disestablished or is about to be dissolved and disestablished and any sums of money remain in any of its funds, the port commissioners are authorized and directed to apply by petition, which may be filed without fee, to the superior court of such county for an order authorizing the transfer of such funds to the school district fund or if there be more than one such district, the school district funds of all districts, which are located within the boundaries of such port district.</p>
