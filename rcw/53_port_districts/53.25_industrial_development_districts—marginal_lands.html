<p>It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the legislature of the state of Washington, that it is in the public interest to employ the power of eminent domain and advance and expend public moneys for the purposes herein contained, and to provide for means by which marginal area properties may be developed or redeveloped in accordance with the legislative policies hereinafter stated:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A sound development of the economic security of the peoples of the state of Washington is dependent upon proper development and redevelopment of marginal properties, and the general welfare of the inhabitants of the port districts in which they exist require the remedying of such injurious conditions marginal properties are now subjected to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development and redevelopment of such marginal area properties cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone without public participation and assistance in the acquisition of land and planning and in the financing of land assembly in the work of clearance, development and redevelopment, and in the making of improvements necessary therefor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To protect and promote sound development and redevelopment of marginal lands as hereinafter defined, and the general welfare of the inhabitants of the port districts in which they exist, to remedying such injurious conditions through the employment of all appropriate means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That whenever the development or redevelopment of such marginal lands cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone, without public participation and assistance in the acquisition of land and planning and in financing of land assembly in the work of clearance, development and redevelopment, and in the making of improvements necessary therefor, it is in the public interest to employ the power of eminent domain, to advance and expend public moneys for those purposes, and to provide for means by which such marginal lands may be developed or redeveloped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the development or redevelopment of such marginal lands and the provision of appropriate continuing land use constitute public uses and purposes for which public moneys may be advanced or expended and private property acquired, and are governmental functions and are of state concern in the interest of health, safety and welfare of the state of Washington, and of the communities in which such areas exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the necessity in the public interest for the provision of this chapter is declared to be a matter of legislative determination.</p>

<p>It is further found and declared that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The existence of such marginal lands characterized by any or all of such conditions constitutes a serious and growing menace which is condemned as injurious and inimical to the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of the communities in which they exist and of the people of the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such marginal lands present difficulties and handicaps which are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory processes in the exercise of the police power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They contribute substantially and increasingly to the problems of, and necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures for, crime prevention, correction, prosecution, and punishment, the treatment of juvenile delinquency, the preservation of the public health and safety, and the maintaining of adequate police, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This menace is becoming increasingly direct and substantial in its significance and effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefits which will result from the remedying of such conditions and the redevelopment of such marginal lands will accrue to all the inhabitants and property owners of the communities in which they exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such conditions of marginal lands tend to further obsolescence, deterioration, and disuse because of the lack of incentive to the individual landowner and his or her inability to improve, modernize, or rehabilitate his or her property while the condition of the neighboring properties remains unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a consequence the process of deterioration of such marginal lands frequently cannot be halted or corrected except by redeveloping the entire area, or substantial portions of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such conditions of marginal lands are chiefly found in areas subdivided into small parcels, held in divided and widely scattered ownerships, frequently under defective titles, and in many such instances the private assembly of the land areas for redevelopment is so difficult and costly that it is uneconomic and as a practical matter impossible for owners to undertake because of lack of the legal power and excessive costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remedying of such conditions may require the public acquisition at fair prices of adequate areas, the redevelopment of the areas suffering from such conditions under proper supervision, with appropriate planning, and continuing land use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development or redevelopment of land, or both, acquired under the authority of this chapter constitute a public use and are governmental functions, and that the sale or leasing of such land after the same has been developed or redeveloped is merely incidental to the accomplishment of the real or fundamental purpose, that is, to remove the condition which caused said property to be marginal property as in this chapter defined.</p>

<p>&quot;Marginal lands&quot; is defined and characterized by any one or more of the following described conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An economic dislocation, deterioration, or disuse resulting from faulty planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subdividing and sale of lots of irregular form and shape and inadequate size for proper usefulness and development.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The existence of inadequate streets, open spaces, and utilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The existence of lots or other areas which are subject to being submerged by water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By a prevalence of depreciated values, impaired investments, and social and economic maladjustment to such an extent that the capacity to pay taxes is reduced and tax receipts are inadequate for the cost of public services rendered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some parts of marginal lands, a growing or total lack of proper utilization of areas, resulting in a stagnant and unproductive condition of land potentially useful and valuable for contributing to the public health, safety and welfare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other parts of marginal lands, a loss of population and reduction of proper utilization of the area, resulting in its further deterioration and added costs to the taxpayer for the creation of new public facilities and services elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property of an assessed valuation of insufficient amount to permit the establishment of a local improvement district for the construction and installation of streets, walks, sewers, water and other utilities.</p>

<li>
<p>Lands within an industrial area which are not devoted to industrial use but which are necessary to industrial development within the industrial area.</p>

<li>
<p>A port commission may, after a public hearing thereon, of which at least ten days' notice must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the port district, create industrial development districts within the district and define the boundaries thereof, if it finds that the creation of the industrial development district is proper and desirable in establishing and developing a system of harbor improvements and industrial development in the port district.</p>

<p>The boundaries of an industrial development district created by subsection (1) of this section may be revised from time to time by resolution of the port commission, to delete land area therefrom, if the land area to be deleted was acquired by the port district with its own funds or by gift or transfer other than pursuant to RCW 53.25.050 or 53.25.060.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As to any land area to be deleted under this subsection that was acquired or improved by the port district with funds obtained through RCW * 53.36.100 or 53.36.160, the port district must deposit funds equal to the fair market value of the lands and improvements into the fund for future use described in RCW * 53.36.100 or 53.36.160 and such funds are thereafter subject to RCW * 53.36.100 or 53.36.160. The fair market value of the land and improvements must be determined as of the effective date of the port commission action deleting the land from the industrial development district and must be determined by an average of at least two independent appraisals by professionally designated real estate appraisers or licensed real estate brokers. The funds must be deposited into the fund for future use described in *RCW 53.36.100 within ninety days of the effective date of the port commission action deleting the land area from the industrial district. Land areas deleted from an industrial development district under this subsection are not further subject to the provisions of this chapter. This subsection applies to presently existing and future industrial development districts. Land areas deleted from an industrial development district under this subsection that were included within such district for less than two years, if the port district acquired the land through condemnation or as a consequence of threatened condemnation, must be offered for sale, for cash, at the appraised price, to the former owner of the property from whom the district obtained title. Such offer must be made by certified or registered letter to the last known address of the former owner. The letter must include the appraised price of the property and notice that the former owner must respond in writing within thirty days or lose the right to purchase. If this right to purchase is exercised, the sale must be closed by midnight of the sixtieth day, including nonbusiness days, following close of the thirty-day period.</p>
