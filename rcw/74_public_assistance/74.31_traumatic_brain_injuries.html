<p>The center for disease control estimates that at least five million three hundred thousand Americans, approximately two percent of the United States population, currently have a long-term or lifelong need for help to perform activities of daily living as a result of a traumatic brain injury. Each year approximately one million four hundred thousand people in this country, including children, sustain traumatic brain injuries as a result of a variety of causes including falls, motor vehicle injuries, being struck by an object, or as a result of an assault and other violent crimes, including domestic violence. Additionally, there are significant numbers of veterans who sustain traumatic brain injuries as a result of their service in the military.</p>
<p>Prevention and the provision of appropriate supports and services in response to traumatic brain injury are consistent with the governor's executive order No. 10-01, &quot;Implementing Health Reform the Washington Way,&quot; which recognizes protection of public health and the improvement of health status as essential responsibilities of the public health system.</p>
<p>Traumatic brain injury can cause a wide range of functional changes affecting thinking, sensation, language, or emotions. It can also cause epilepsy and increase the risk for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other brain disorders that become more prevalent with age. The impact of a traumatic brain injury on the individual and family can be devastating.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that current programs and services are not funded or designed to address the diverse needs of this population. It is the intent of the legislature to develop a comprehensive plan to help individuals with traumatic brain injuries meet their needs. The legislature also recognizes the efforts of many in the private sector who are providing services and assistance to individuals with traumatic brain injuries. The legislature intends to bring together those in both the public and private sectors with expertise in this area to address the needs of this growing population.</p>
