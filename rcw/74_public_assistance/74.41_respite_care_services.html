<p>The legislature recognizes that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most care provided for functionally disabled adults is delivered by family members or friends who are not compensated for their services. Family involvement is a crucial element for avoiding or postponing institutionalization of the disabled adult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family or other caregivers who provide continuous care in the home are frequently under substantial stress, physical, psychological, and financial. The stress, if unrelieved by family or community support to the caregiver, may lead to premature or unnecessary nursing home placement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respite care and other community-based supportive services for the caregiver and for the disabled adult could relieve some of the stresses, maintain and strengthen the family structure, and postpone or prevent institutionalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With family and friends providing the primary care for the disabled adult, supplemented by community health and social services, long-term care may be less costly than if the individual were institutionalized.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature to provide a comprehensive program of long-term care information and support, including in-home and out-of-home respite care services, for family and other unpaid caregivers who provide the daily services required when caring for adults with functional disabilities. The family caregiver long-term care information and support services shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Provide information, relief, and support to family or other unpaid caregivers of adults with functional disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage family and other nonpaid individuals to provide care for adults with functional disabilities at home, and thus offer a viable alternative to placement in a long-term care facility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that respite care is made generally available on a sliding-fee basis to eligible participants in the program according to priorities established by the department;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be provided in the least restrictive setting available consistent with the individually assessed needs of the adults with functional disabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include services appropriate to the needs of persons caring for individuals with dementing illnesses; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide unpaid family and other unpaid caregivers with services that enable them to make informed decisions about current and future care plans, solve day-to-day caregiving problems, learn essential caregiving skills, and locate services that may strengthen their capacity to provide care.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>&quot;Respite care services&quot; means relief care for families or other caregivers of adults with functional disabilities, eligibility for which shall be determined by the department by rule. The services provide temporary care or supervision of adults with functional disabilities in substitution for the caregiver. The term includes adult day services.</p>
</li>

<p>&quot;Eligible participant for respite care services&quot; means an adult who needs substantially continuous care or supervision by reason of his or her functional disability and is also assessed as requiring placement into a long-term care facility in the absence of an unpaid family or other unpaid caregiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Unpaid caregiver&quot; means a spouse, relative, or friend who has primary responsibility for the care of an adult with a functional disability and who does not receive financial compensation for the care.
