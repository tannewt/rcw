The original terms of existence of any community municipal corporation shall be for at least four years and until the first Monday in January next following a regular municipal election held in the city.

Any such community municipal corporation may be continued thereafter for additional periods of four years' duration with the approval of the voters at an election held and conducted in the manner provided for in this section.

Authorization for a community municipal corporation to continue its term of existence for each additional period of four years may be initiated pursuant to a resolution or a petition in the following manner:

1. A resolution praying for such continuation may be adopted by the community council and shall be filed not less than seven months prior to the end of the term of existence of such corporation with the city council or other legislative body of the city in which the service area is located.

2. A petition for continuation shall be signed by at least ten percent of the registered voters residing within the service area and shall be filed not less than six months prior to the end of the term of existence of such corporation with the city council or other legislative body of the city in which the service area is located.

At the same election at which a proposition is submitted to the voters of the service area for the continuation of the community municipal corporation for an additional period of four years, the community councilmembers of such municipal corporation shall be elected. The positions on such council shall be the same in number as the original or initial council and shall be numbered consecutively and elected at large. Declarations of candidacy and withdrawals shall be in the same manner as is provided for members of the city council or other legislative body of the city.

Upon receipt of a petition, the city clerk shall examine the signatures thereon and certify to the sufficiency thereof. No person may withdraw his or her name from a petition after it has been filed.

Upon receipt of a valid resolution or upon duly certifying a petition for continuation of a community municipal corporation, the city clerk with whom the resolution or petition was filed shall cause a proposition on continuation of the term of existence of the community municipal corporation to be placed on the ballot at the next city general election. No person shall be eligible to vote on such proposition at such election unless he or she is a qualified voter and resident of the service area.

The ballots shall contain the words "For continuation of community municipal corporation" and "Against continuation of community municipal corporation" or words equivalent thereto, and shall also contain the names of the candidates to be voted for to fill the positions on the community council. The names of all candidates to be voted upon shall be printed on the ballot alphabetically in groups under the numbered position on the council for which they are candidates.

If the results of the election as certified by the county canvassing board reveal that a majority of the votes cast are for continuation, the municipal corporation shall continue in existence for an additional period of four years, and certificates of election shall be issued to the successful candidates who shall assume office at the same time as members of the city council or other legislative body of the city.
