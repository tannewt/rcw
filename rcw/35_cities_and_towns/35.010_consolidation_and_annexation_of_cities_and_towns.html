<p>The following methods are available for the annexation of all or a part of a city or town to another city or town:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A petition for an election to vote upon the annexation, which proposed annexation is approved by the legislative body of the city or town from which the territory will be taken, may be submitted to the legislative body of the city or town to which annexation is proposed. An annexation under this subsection shall otherwise conform with the requirements for and procedures of a petition and election method of annexing unincorporated territory under chapter 35.13 RCW, except for the requirement for the approval of the annexation by the city or town from which the territory would be taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislative body of a city or town may on its own initiative by resolution indicate its desire to be annexed to a city or town either in whole or in part, or the legislative body of a city or town proposing to annex all or part of another city or town may initiate the annexation by adopting a resolution indicating that desire. In case such resolution is passed, such resolution shall be transmitted to the other affected city or town. The annexation is effective if the other city or town adopts a resolution concurring in the annexation, unless the owners of property in the area proposed to be annexed, equal in value to sixty percent or more of the assessed valuation of the property in the area, protest the proposed annexation in writing to the legislative body of the city or town proposing to annex the area, within thirty days of the adoption of the second resolution accepting the annexation. Notices of the public hearing at which the second resolution is adopted shall be mailed to the owners of the property within the area proposed to be annexed in the same manner that notices of a hearing on a proposed local improvement district are required to be mailed by a city or town as provided in chapter 35.43 RCW. An annexation under this subsection shall be potentially subject to review by a boundary review board or other annexation review board after the adoption of the initial resolution, and the second resolution may not be adopted until the proposed annexation has been approved by the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The owners of property located in a city or town may petition for annexation to another city or town. An annexation under this subsection shall conform with the requirements for and procedures of a direct petition method of annexing unincorporated territory, except that the legislative body of the city or town from which the territory would be taken must approve the annexation before it may proceed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All annexations under this section are subject to potential review by the local boundary review board or annexation review board.</p>

<p>In all cases of annexation, the county canvassing board or boards shall canvass the votes cast thereat.</p>
<p>In an election on the question of the annexation of all or a part of a city to another city, the votes cast in the city or portion thereof to be annexed shall be canvassed, and if a majority of the votes cast be in favor of annexation, the results shall be included in a statement indicating the total number of votes cast.</p>
<p>A proposition for the assumption of indebtedness outside the constitutional and/or statutory limits by the other city or cities in which the indebtedness did not originate shall be deemed approved if a majority of at least three-fifths of the voters of each city in which the indebtedness did not originate votes in favor thereof, and the number of persons voting on such proposition constitutes not less than forty percent of the total number of votes cast in such cities in which indebtedness did not originate at the last preceding general election: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That if general obligation bond indebtedness was incurred by action by the city legislative body, a proposition for the assumption of such indebtedness by the other city or cities in which such indebtedness did not originate shall be deemed approved if a majority of the voters of each city in which such indebtedness did not originate votes in favor thereof.</p>
<p>A duly certified copy of such statement of an annexation election shall be filed with the legislative body of each of the cities affected and recorded upon its minutes, and it shall be the duty of the clerk, or other officer performing the duties of clerk, of each of such legislative bodies, to transmit to the secretary of state and the office of financial management a duly certified copy of the record of such statement.</p>

Upon receipt of such request by the civil service commission the transfer of employment shall be made. The employee so transferring will (a) be on probation for the same period as are new employees in the position filled, but if the transferring employee has already completed a probationary period as a firefighter prior to the transfer, then the employee may only be terminated during the probationary period for failure to adequately perform assigned duties, not meeting the minimum qualifications of the position, or behavior that would otherwise be subject to disciplinary action, (b) be eligible for promotion no later than after completion of the probationary period, (c) receive a salary at least equal to that of other new employees in the position filled, and (d) in all other matters, such as retirement, sick leave, and vacation, have, within the city or code city civil service system, all the rights, benefits, and privileges to which he or she would have been entitled as a member of the consolidated city fire department from the beginning of his or her employment with the former city or code city fire department: PROVIDED, That for purposes of layoffs by the consolidated city or code city, only the time of service accrued with the consolidated city or code city shall apply unless an agreement is reached between the collective bargaining representatives of the employees of the consolidating fire agencies and consolidated agencies and the consolidating and consolidated fire agencies. A record of the employee's service with the former city or code city fire department shall be transmitted to the applicable civil service commission and shall be credited to such employee as a part of the period of employment in the consolidated city fire department. All accrued benefits are transferable provided that the recipient agency provides comparable benefits. All benefits shall then accrue based on the combined seniority of each employee in the recipient agency.</p>

<li>
<p>As many of the transferring employees shall be placed upon the payroll of the consolidated city or code city fire department as the department determines are needed to provide services. These needed employees shall be taken in order of greatest seniority from any of the seniority lists of the consolidating city or code city and the remaining employees who transfer as provided in this section and RCW 35.10.510 and 35.10.530 shall head the list for employment in the civil service system in order of their seniority, to the end that they shall be the first to be reemployed in the fire department when appropriate positions become available: PROVIDED, That employees who are not immediately hired by the city, code city, or town shall be placed on a reemployment list for a period not to exceed thirty-six months unless a longer period is authorized by an agreement reached between the collective bargaining representatives of the employees of the consolidating fire agencies and consolidated fire agency and the consolidating and consolidated fire agencies.</p>

<p>Unless a commission form of government is prescribed or submitted to the voters under RCW 35.10.430, a joint resolution or petition may prescribe that wards be used to elect the councilmembers of the consolidated city. The joint resolution or petition must contain a map of the proposed consolidated city that clearly delineates the boundaries of each ward. Each ward in the proposed consolidated city shall contain approximately the same population. To the greatest extent possible, the integrity of the boundaries of the cities that are proposed to be consolidated shall be respected when the wards are drawn so that the territory within each city is: (1) Included within the fewest number of wards, to the extent the city has a population that is greater than the maximum population established for each ward; or (2) included wholly within one ward, to the extent the city has a population that is equal to or less than the maximum population established for each ward. After the election specified in RCW 35.10.480, election wards may be modified in the manner specified in RCW 35A.12.180.</p>
