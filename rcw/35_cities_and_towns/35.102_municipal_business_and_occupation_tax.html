<p>The legislature finds that businesses in Washington are concerned about the potential for multiple taxation that arises due to the various city business and occupation taxes and are concerned about the lack of uniformity among city jurisdictions. The current system has a negative impact on Washington's business climate. The legislature further finds that local business and occupation tax revenue provides a sizable portion of city revenue that is used for essential services. The legislature recognizes that local government services contribute to a healthy business climate.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to provide for a more uniform system of city business and occupation taxes that eliminates multiple taxation, while allowing for some continued local control and flexibility to cities.</p>

If a city has a small business threshold or exemption in excess of that provided in this subsection as of January 1, 2003, and chooses to deviate below the threshold or exemption level that was in place as of January 1, 2003, the city must notify all businesses licensed to do business within the city at least one hundred twenty days prior to the potential implementation of a lower threshold or exemption amount;</p>

<li>
<p>If a business activity allocated under this subsection (1) takes place in more than one city and all cities impose a gross receipts tax, a credit must be allowed as provided in RCW 35.102.060; if not all of the cities impose a gross receipts tax, the affected cities must allow another credit or allocation system as they and the taxpayer agree.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gross income derived as royalties from the granting of intangible rights must be allocated to the commercial domicile of the taxpayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gross income derived from activities taxed as services shall be apportioned to a city by multiplying apportionable income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service-income factor and the denominator of which is two.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the city during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the city if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>The individual is primarily assigned within the city;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period and the employee performs fifty percent or more of his or her service for the tax period in the city; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform fifty percent or more of his or her service in any city, and the employee resides in the city.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The service income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service income is in the city if the customer location is in the city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the service income factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in the city, and the gross income is attributable under (b) of this subsection (3) to a city or unincorporated area of a county within the United States or to a foreign country in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (3)(c), &quot;not taxable&quot; means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that city or county within the United States or by that foreign country, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a city or county within the United States or in a foreign country in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with the city or county within the United States or with the foreign country under the standards in RCW 35.102.050 regardless of whether that city or county within the United States or that foreign country imposes such a tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (3) do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in the city, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Separate accounting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in the city; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The party petitioning for, or the tax administrator requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income pursuant to subsection (d) of this subsection (3) must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (3) do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in the city; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The same burden of proof shall apply whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the tax administrator is requiring, the use of an alternative, reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.</p>
<ol type="a" start="6">
<li>
<p>If the tax administrator requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income, the tax administrator cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer's reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection (3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A taxpayer that has received written permission from the tax administrator to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the tax administrator reasonably relied in approving a reasonable alternative method.</p>

<p>The department of revenue shall conduct a study of the net fiscal impacts of chapter 79, Laws of 2003, with particular emphasis on the revenue impacts of the apportionment and allocation method contained in RCW 35.102.130 and any revenue impact resulting from the increased uniformity and consistency provided through the model ordinance.

The department shall report the final results of the study to the governor and the fiscal committees of the legislature by November 30, 2005. In addition, the department shall provide progress reports to the governor and the fiscal committees of the legislature on November 30, 2003, and November 30, 2004.
