<p>Any city may, by majority vote of its electors, withdraw from participation in the retirement system two years after giving written notice to the board of such action by the electorate. It is hereby specifically provided, however, that the city's obligation to those members receiving or eligible to a retirement allowance prior to such termination of participation shall continue in full force and effect as provided in this chapter. Members not receiving or being eligible to a retirement allowance at time of such termination shall be paid their accumulated contributions on demand. Should it develop that any such city is entitled to a refund such refund shall be made within one year following demand of city entitled thereto.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his or her accumulated normal contributions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pension provided by the contributions of the city which, together with his or her annuity provided by his or her accumulated normal contributions, shall make his or her retirement allowance equal to thirty percent of his or her final compensation for the first ten years of service, which allowance shall be increased by one and one-half percent for each year of service in excess of ten years to a maximum of fifty percent of his or her final compensation; otherwise he or she shall receive a retirement allowance of forty dollars per month or, except as to a part time employee, such sum, monthly, not in excess of sixty dollars per month, as is equal to six dollars per month for each year of his or her creditable service, whichever is greater. If the retirement allowance of a part time employee, based upon the pension hereinabove provided, does not exceed forty dollars per month, then such part time employee shall receive a retirement allowance of forty dollars per month and no more.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing herein contained shall be construed in a manner to increase or to decrease any pension being paid or to be paid to a member retired prior to August 6, 1965.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>If it appears to the satisfaction of the board that permanent and total disability was incurred in line of duty, a member shall receive in lieu of the retirement allowance provided under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section full pay from, and be furnished all hospital and medical care by, the city for a period of six months from the date of his or her disability, and commencing at the expiration of such six month period, shall receive a retirement allowance, regardless of his or her age or years of service, equal to fifty percent of his or her final compensation exclusive of any other benefit he or she may receive.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Upon the death of a member while in receipt of a disability retirement allowance, his or her accumulated contributions, as they were at the date of his or her retirement, less any annuity payments made to him or her, shall be paid to his or her estate, or to such persons having an insurable interest in his or her life as he or she shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board. In the alternative, if there be a surviving spouse, or if no surviving spouse, there are surviving a child or children under the age of eighteen years, upon written notice to the board by such spouse, or if there be no such spouse, by the duly appointed, qualified and acting guardian of such child or children, within sixty days of the date of such member's death, there shall be paid to such spouse during his or her lifetime, or, if there be no such spouse, to such child or children, until they shall reach the age of eighteen years, a monthly pension equal to one-half of the monthly final compensation of such deceased member. If any such spouse or child or children shall marry, then such person so marrying shall thereafter receive no further pension herein provided.</p>

<li>
<p>The board may, at its pleasure, require any disability beneficiary under age sixty-two in the miscellaneous personnel and under age fifty-five in the uniformed personnel to undergo medical examination by medical authority designated by the board. Upon the basis of such examination the board shall determine whether such disability beneficiary is still totally and permanently incapacitated, either physically or mentally, for service in the office or department of the city where he or she was employed or in any other position in that city, the duties of which he or she might reasonably be expected to carry out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the board shall determine that the beneficiary is not so incapacitated his or her retirement allowance shall be canceled and he or she shall be reinstated forthwith in city service. If the city is unable to find employment for a disability beneficiary found to be no longer totally and permanently disabled, the board shall continue the disability retirement allowance of the beneficiary until such time as employment is available, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should a disability beneficiary reenter city service and be eligible for membership in the retirement system, his or her retirement allowance shall be canceled and he or she shall immediately become a member of the retirement system, his or her rate of contribution for future years being that established for his or her age at the time of such reentry. His or her individual account shall be credited with his or her accumulated contributions less the annuity payments made to him or her. An amount equal to the accumulated normal contributions so credited to him or her shall again be held for the benefit of said member and shall no longer be included in the amounts available to meet the obligations of the city on account of benefits that have been granted. Such member shall receive credit for prior service in the same manner as if he or she had never been retired for disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should any disability beneficiary under age sixty-two in the miscellaneous personnel or under age fifty-five in the uniformed personnel, refuse to submit to medical examination, his or her retirement allowance may be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal, and should refusal continue for one year, his or her retirement allowance may be canceled. Should said disability beneficiary, prior to attaining age sixty-two or age fifty-five, as the case may be, engage in a gainful occupation the board shall reduce the amount of his or her retirement allowance to an amount, which when added to the compensation earned by him or her in such occupation, shall not exceed the amount of the final compensation on the basis of which his or her retirement allowance was determined. Should the earning capacity of such beneficiary be further altered, the board may further alter his or her retirement allowance as indicated above. When said disability beneficiary reaches age sixty-two, if included in the miscellaneous personnel, or age fifty-five, in the uniformed personnel, his or her retirement allowance shall be made equal to the amount upon which he or she was originally retired, and shall not again be modified for any cause except as provided in RCW 41.44.250.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the retirement allowance of any disability beneficiary be canceled for any cause other than reentrance into city service, he or she shall be paid his or her accumulated contributions, less annuity payments made to him or her.</p>
