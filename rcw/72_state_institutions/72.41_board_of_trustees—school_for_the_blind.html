<p>There is hereby created a board of trustees for the state school for the blind to be composed of a resident from each of the state's congressional districts now or hereafter existing.

A representative of the parent-teachers association of the Washington state school for the blind, a representative of the Washington council of the blind, a representative of the national federation of the blind of Washington, one representative designated by the teacher association of the Washington state school for the blind, and a representative of the classified staff designated by his or her exclusive bargaining representative shall each be ex officio and nonvoting members of the board of trustees and shall serve during their respective tenures in such positions.</p>

<p>One trustee shall be a resident and qualified elector from each of the state's congressional districts. The board shall not be deemed to be unlawfully constituted and a trustee shall not be deemed ineligible to serve the remainder of the trustee's unexpired term on the board solely by reason of the establishment of new or revised boundaries for congressional districts. No voting trustee may be an employee of the state school for the blind, a member of the board of directors of any school district, a member of the governing board of any public or private educational institution, a school district or educational service district administrator, appointed after July 1, 1986, or an elected officer or member of the legislative authority or any municipal corporation.</p>
<p>The board of trustees shall organize itself by electing a chair from its members. The board shall adopt a seal and may adopt such bylaws, rules, and regulations as it deems necessary for its own government. A majority of the voting members of the board in office shall constitute a quorum, but a lesser number may convene from time to time and may compel the attendance of absent members in such manner as prescribed in its bylaws, rules, or regulations. The superintendent of the state school for the blind shall serve as, or may designate another person to serve as, the secretary of the board, who shall not be deemed to be a member of the board.</p>

<p>The terms of office of trustees on the board for the state school for the blind who are appointed from the various congressional districts shall not be affected by the creation of either new boundaries for congressional districts or additional districts. In such an event, each trustee may continue to serve in office for the balance of the term for which he or she was appointed: PROVIDED, That the trustee continues to reside within the boundaries of the congressional district as they existed at the time of his or her appointment. Vacancies which occur in a trustee position during the balance of any such term shall be filled pursuant to RCW 72.41.020, as now or hereafter amended, by a successor who resides within the boundaries of the congressional district from which the member whose office was vacated was appointed as they existed at the time of his or her election. At the completion of such term, and thereafter, a successor shall be appointed from the congressional district which corresponds in number with the congressional district from which the incumbent was appointed.</p>
