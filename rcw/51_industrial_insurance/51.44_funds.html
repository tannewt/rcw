The assets of this fund shall not be used for any purposes other than meeting the obligations of this title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before proposing premium rates as provided in RCW 51.16.035, the director shall determine whether the assets of the accident and medical aid funds combined are at least ten percent but not more than thirty percent in excess of its funded liabilities, and if so transfer any excess to the industrial insurance rainy day fund, unless doing so would:</p>

<p>When adopting premium rates, the director may transfer moneys from the industrial insurance rainy day fund into the accident fund or medical aid fund upon finding that the transfer is necessary to reduce a rate increase or aid businesses in recovering from or during economic recessions. The director may also transfer moneys from this fund at any time liabilities increase so that total liabilities exceed assets of the accident fund, medical aid fund, or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding chapter 51.52 RCW, the director's decisions regarding transfers into and out of the industrial insurance rainy day fund are not reviewable by any court or tribunal, but must be announced as part of the rule-making process for setting premium rates, and must be part of the department's rule-making file required by chapter 34.05 RCW.</p>

<p>There is in the office of the state treasurer a fund to be known and designated as the &quot;second injury fund,&quot; which may be used only for the purpose of defraying charges against employers and for supporting return-to-work outcomes for injured workers as provided in RCW 51.16.120, 51.32.095(4), and 51.32.250. The fund must be administered by the director. The state treasurer must be the custodian of the second injury fund and is authorized to disburse moneys from it only upon written order of the director.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Assessments for the second injury fund must be imposed on self-insurers pursuant to rules adopted by the director. Such rules must provide for at least the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, the amount assessed each self-insurer must be in the proportion that the payments made from the fund on account of claims made against self-insurers bears to the total sum of payments from the fund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in section 2, chapter 475, Laws of 2005, beginning with assessments imposed on or after July 1, 2009, the department must experience rate the amount assessed each self-insurer as long as the aggregate amount assessed is in the proportion that the payments made from the fund on account of claims made against self-insurers bears to the total sum of payments from the fund. The experience rating factor must provide equal weight to the ratio between expenditures made by the second injury fund for claims of the self-insurer to the total expenditures made by the second injury fund for claims of all self-insurers for the prior three fiscal years and the ratio of workers' compensation claim payments under this title made by the self-insurer to the total worker's compensation claim payments made by all self-insurers under this title for the prior three fiscal years. The weighted average of these two ratios must be divided by the latter ratio to arrive at the experience factor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For purposes of this subsection, &quot;expenditures made by the second injury fund&quot; mean the costs and charges described under RCW 51.32.250 and 51.16.120(4), and the amounts assessed to the second injury fund as described under RCW 51.16.120(1). Under no circumstances does &quot;expenditures made by the second injury fund&quot; include any subsequent payments, assessments, or adjustments for pensions, where the applicable second injury fund entitlement was established outside of the three fiscal years.</p>

<p>As an alternative to payment procedures otherwise provided under law, in the event of death or permanent total disability to workers of self-insured employers, a self-insured employer may upon establishment of such obligation file with the department a bond, an assignment of account from a federally or state chartered commercial banking institution authorized to conduct business in the state of Washington, or purchase an annuity, in an amount deemed by the department to be reasonably sufficient to insure payment of the pension benefits provided by law. Any purchase of an annuity shall be from an institution meeting the following minimum requirements: (a) The institution must be rated no less than &quot;A+&quot; by A.M. Best, and no less than &quot;AA&quot; by Moody's and by Standard &amp; Poor's; (b) the value of the assets of the institution must not be less than ten billion dollars; (c) not more than ten percent of the institution's assets may include bonds that are rated less than &quot;BBB&quot; by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's; (d) not more than five percent of the assets may be held as equity in real estate; and (e) not more than twenty-five percent of the assets may be first mortgages, and not more than five percent may be second mortgages. The department shall adopt rules governing assignments of account and annuities. Such rules shall ensure that the funds are available if needed, even in the case of failure of the banking institution, the institution authorized to provide annuities, or the employer's business.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The annuity value for every such case shall be determined by the department based upon the department's experience as to rates of mortality, disability, remarriage, and interest. The amount of the required bond, assignment of account, or annuity may be reviewed and adjusted periodically by the department, based upon periodic redeterminations by the department as to the outstanding annuity value for the case.</p>
<p>Under such an alternative, the department shall administer the payment of this obligation to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. The department shall be reimbursed for all such payments from the self-insured employer through periodic charges not less than quarterly in a manner to be determined by the director. The self-insured employer shall additionally pay to the department a deposit equal to the first three months' payments otherwise required under RCW 51.32.050 and 51.32.060. Such deposit shall be placed in the reserve fund in accordance with RCW 51.44.140 and shall be returned to the respective self-insured employer when monthly payments are no longer required for such particular obligation.</p>
<p>If a self-insurer delays or refuses to reimburse the department beyond fifteen days after the reimbursement charges become due, there shall be a penalty paid by the self-insurer upon order of the director of an additional amount equal to twenty-five percent of the amount then due which shall be paid into the pension reserve fund. Such an order shall conform to the requirements of RCW 51.52.050.</p>

Only the executive head of the agency or institution of higher education, or designee, may authorize expenditures from the account. No agency or institution of higher education may make an expenditure from the account for an amount greater than the refund earned by the agency. If the agency or institution of higher education has staff dedicated to workers' compensation claims management, expenditures from the account must be used to pay for that staff, but additional expenditure from the account may be used for any program within an agency or institution of higher education that promotes or provides incentives for employee workplace safety and health and early, appropriate return-to-work for injured employees. During the 2009-2011 fiscal biennium, the legislature may transfer from the industrial insurance premium refund account to the state general fund such amounts as reflect the excess fund balance of the account.</p>
