## 15.04.150 - Berry harvesting by youthful workers—Legislative finding.
The legislature finds that the crops of berry growers in the state are imperiled by a recent change in the federal law relating to youthful agricultural workers. Since the berry harvest season is so short that few migrant agricultural workers find the trip to this state to pick berries worth the trouble, the long-established use of younger pickers must be permitted to the extent where such employment will not interfere with interstate commerce and the federal law. Further, the legislature finds that such employment is healthful, a good indoctrination for youth in the work ethic and the role of agriculture in society, and an opportunity youths welcome to earn extra spending money.

## 15.04.160 - Berry harvesting by youthful workers—Authorized—Restrictions.

\[ [1987 c 393 § 26](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1987c393.pdf?cite=1987%20c%20393%20§%2026); \]

## 15.04.400 - Findings—Department's duty to promote agriculture, protect public health and welfare.
The history, economy, culture, and the future of Washington state to a large degree all involve agriculture, which is vital to the economic well-being of the state. The legislature finds that farmers and ranchers are responsible stewards of the land, but are increasingly subjected to complaints and unwarranted restrictions that encourage, and even force, the premature removal of lands from agricultural uses.

The legislature further finds that it is now in the overriding public interest that support for agriculture be clearly expressed and that adequate protection be given to agricultural lands, uses, activities, and operations.

The legislature further finds that the department of agriculture has a duty to promote and protect agriculture and its dependent rural community in Washington state however, the duty shall not be construed as to diminish the responsibility of the department to fully carry out its assigned regulatory responsibilities to protect the public health and welfare.

\[ [1994 c 46 § 9](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6463-S.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%2046%20§%209); [1991 c 280 § 1](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5096-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20280%20§%201); \]

## 15.04.402 - Department to advance private sector, economic well-being of agricultural industry.
The department shall seek to enhance, protect, and perpetuate the ability of the private sector to produce food and fiber. Additionally, the department shall seek, consistent with its regulatory responsibilities, to maintain the economic well-being of the agricultural industry and its dependent rural community in Washington state.

\[ [1994 c 46 § 10](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1993-94/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6463-S.SL.pdf?cite=1994%20c%2046%20§%2010); [1991 c 280 § 2](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1991-92/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5096-S2.SL.pdf?cite=1991%20c%20280%20§%202); \]

## 15.04.410 - Declarations of "Washington state grown"—Restrictions—Violations unlawful—Application of consumer protection act.
1. Before being offered for retail sale in this state, any agricultural commodity, defined under RCW 15.66.010, that was grown or raised in this state may be advertised, labeled, described, sold, marked, or otherwise held out, with the words "Washington state grown," or other similar language indicating that the product is from Washington state grown or raised agricultural commodities.

2. An agricultural commodity that was not grown or raised in this state and packages of that product shall not be advertised, labeled, described, sold, marked, or otherwise held out as "Washington state grown," or in any way as to imply that such product is a Washington state grown or raised agricultural commodity.

3. It is unlawful for any person to violate this section.

4. The legislature finds that the practices covered by this section are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Violations of this section are not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business. A violation of this section is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.

## 15.04.415 - Information on product country of origin—Findings—Use of placards.
1. The legislature finds that it is a common practice for consumers to be provided information as to the country [of] origin for many products available to them for purchase. The legislature finds that consumers have a right to know the origin of the fresh fruits and vegetables being offered to them at retail sale. The legislature finds that there is value to the consumer being able to make an informed buying decision as to whether the fresh fruit or vegetable was produced under standards and conditions required in the United States. Further, the legislature finds that consumers should be given the ability to make an informed choice to buy fresh fruits and vegetables that are grown in Washington state as a means of supporting the economy of the state.

2. Stores or other businesses offering fresh fruit and vegetables for retail sale to consumers shall place a placard on the bin, shelf, or other location the product is displayed that informs the consumer where the fruit or vegetable was grown if it was grown in the United States or grown in Washington.

Placards are not required if (a) the product was grown outside of the United States, or (b) each item in the bin, shelf, or other location contains a sticker or label that indicates where the fruit or vegetable product was grown.
