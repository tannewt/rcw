<p>The legislature declares that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Marketing is a dynamic and changing part of Washington agriculture and a vital element in expanding the state economy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sale in this state and export to other states and abroad of beer made in this state contribute substantial benefits to the economy of the state and provide a large number of jobs and sizeable tax revenues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The production of beer in this state is a new and important segment of Washington agriculture that has potential for greater contribution to the economy of the state if it undergoes continued development; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The general welfare of the people of this state will be served by continued development of the activities of the production of beer, that will improve the tax bases of local communities where agricultural land and processing facilities are located, and reduce the need for state and federal funding of local services. The industries are therefore affected with the public interest.</p>

<li>
<p>Subject to the referendum conducted under RCW 15.89.040, there is created an agricultural commodity commission, to be known as the Washington beer commission. The commission shall be comprised of seven voting members; six members shall be producers and one voting member shall be the director.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five voting members of the commission constitute a quorum for the transaction of any commission business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each producer member shall be a citizen and resident of this state and over the age of twenty-one. Each producer member must be engaged in producing beer, and must, during his or her term of office, derive a substantial portion of income from the production of beer, or have a substantial investment in the production of beer as an owner, lessee, partner, or the manager or executive officer of such a corporation. No more than one board member may be part of the same person as defined by RCW 15.04.010. These qualifications apply throughout each member's term of office but do not apply to the director.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The producer members shall serve three-year terms. Of the initial voting members, two members shall be appointed for a one-year term, two members shall be appointed for a two-year term, and two members shall be appointed for a three-year term.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of a petition containing the signatures of five beer producers from a statewide Washington state craft brewing trade association or from other producers to implement this chapter and to determine producer participation in the commission and assessment under this chapter, the director shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Conduct a referendum of beer producers. The requirements of assent or approval of the referendum are met if:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>At least fifty-one percent by numbers of producers participating in the referendum vote affirmatively; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirty percent of the producers and thirty percent of the production have been represented in the referendum to determine assent or approval of participation and assessment. The referendum shall be conducted within sixty days of receipt of the petition; and</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a list of beer producers from information provided by the petitioners, by obtaining information on beer producers from applicable producer organizations or associations or other sources identified as maintaining the information. In establishing a current list of beer producers and their individual production, the director shall use the beer producer's name, mailing address, and production by the producer in the preceding fiscal year. Information on each producer shall be mailed to each beer producer on record with the director for verification. All corrections shall be filed with the director within twenty days from the date of mailing. The list of producers shall be kept in a file by the director. The list shall be certified as a true representation of the referendum mailing list. Inadvertent failure to notify a producer does not invalidate a proceeding conducted under this chapter. The director shall provide the commission the list of producers after assent in a referendum as provided in this section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the director determines that the requisite assent has been given in the referendum conducted under subsection (1) of this section, the director shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Within sixty days after assent of the referendum held, appoint the members of the commission; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct the commission to put into force the assessment as provided for in RCW 15.89.110.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the director determines that the requisite assent has not been given in the referendum conducted under subsection (1) of this section, the director shall take no further action to implement or enforce this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon completion of the referendum conducted under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall tally the results of the vote and provide the results to producers. If a producer disputes the results of a vote, that producer within sixty days from the announced results, shall provide in writing a statement of why the vote is disputed and request a recount. Once the vote is tallied and distributed, all disputes are resolved, and all matters in a vote are finalized, the individual ballots may be destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before conducting the referendum provided for in subsection (1) of this section, the director may require the petitioners to deposit with him or her an amount of money as the director deems necessary to defray the expenses of conducting the referendum. The director shall provide the petitioners an estimate of expenses that may be incurred to conduct a referendum before any service takes place. Petitioners shall deposit funds with the director to pay for expenses incurred by the department. The commission shall reimburse petitioners the amount paid to the department when funds become available. However, if for any reason the referendum process is discontinued, the petitioners shall reimburse the department for expenses incurred by the department up until the time the process is discontinued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The director is not required to hold a referendum under subsection (1) of this section more than once in any twelve-month period.</p>

<p>The director shall appoint the producer members of the commission. In making appointments, no later than ninety days before an expiration of a commission member's term, the director shall call for recommendations for commission member positions, and the director shall take into consideration recommendations made by a statewide Washington state craft brewing trade association or other producers. In appointing persons to the commission, the director shall seek a balanced representation on the commission that reflects the composition of the beer producers throughout the state on the basis of beer produced and geographic location. Information on beer production by geographic location shall be provided by the commission upon the director's request.</p>

<li>
<p>If a position on the commission becomes vacant due to resignation, disqualification, death, or for any other reason, the commission shall notify the director and the unexpired term shall immediately be filled by appointment by the director.</p>

<p>Obligations incurred by the commission and any other liabilities or claims against the commission shall be enforced only against the assets of the commission and, except to the extent of such assets, no liability for the debts or actions of the commission exists against either the state of Washington or any subdivision or instrumentality thereof or against any member, employee, or agent of the commission or the state of Washington in his or her individual capacity. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, neither the commission members, nor its employees, may be held individually responsible for errors in judgment, mistakes, or other acts, either of commission or omission, as principal, agent, person, or employee, except for their own individual acts of dishonesty or crime. No person or employee may be held individually responsible for any act or omission of any other commission members. The liability of the commission members shall be several and not joint, and no member is liable for the default of any other member. This provision confirms that commission members have been and continue to be, state officers or volunteers for purposes of RCW 4.92.075 and are entitled to the defenses, indemnifications, limitations of liability, and other protections and benefits of chapter 4.92 RCW.</p>
