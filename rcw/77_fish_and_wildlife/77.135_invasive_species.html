</li>
<li>
<p>The department may delegate selected and clearly identified elements of its authorities and duties to another agency of the state with appropriate expertise or administrative capacity upon cooperative agreement with that agency. This delegation may include provisions of funding for implementation of the delegations. The department retains primary authority and responsibility for all requirements of this chapter unless otherwise directed in this chapter.</p>

<li>
<p>The department, in consultation with the invasive species council, may classify or reclassify and list by rule nonnative aquatic animal species as prohibited level 1, level 2, or level 3, based on the degree of invasive risk, the type of management action required, and resources available to conduct the management action.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Species classified as prohibited level 1 pose a high invasive risk and are a priority for prevention and expedited rapid response management actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Species classified as prohibited level 2 pose a high invasive risk and are a priority for long-term infested site management actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Species classified as prohibited level 3 pose a moderate to high invasive risk and may be appropriate for prevention, rapid response, or other prohibited species management plan actions by the department, another agency, a local government, tribes, or the public.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The department, in consultation with the invasive species council, may classify and list by rule regulated type A species. This classification is used for nonnative aquatic animal species that pose a low to moderate invasive risk that can be managed based on intended use or geographic scope of introduction, have a beneficial use, and are a priority for department-led or department-approved management of the species' beneficial use and invasive risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonnative aquatic animal species not classified as prohibited level 1, level 2, or level 3 under subsection (1) of this section, or as regulated type A species under subsection (2) of this section, are automatically managed statewide as regulated type B species or regulated type C species and do not require listing by rule.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Species managed as regulated type B pose a low or unknown invasive risk and are possessed for personal or commercial purposes, such as for aquariums, live food markets, or as nondomesticated pets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Species managed as regulated type C pose a low or unknown invasive risk and include all other species that do not meet the criteria for management as a regulated type B invasive species.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classification of prohibited and regulated species:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>May be by individual species or larger taxonomic groups up to the family name;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must align, as practical and appropriate, with regional and national classification levels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must be statewide unless otherwise designated by a water body, property, or other geographic region or area; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May define general possession and introduction conditions acceptable under department authorization, a permit, or as otherwise provided by rule.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to or at the time of classifying species by rule as prohibited or regulated under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the department, in consultation with the invasive species council, must adopt rules establishing standards for determining invasive risk levels and criteria for determining beneficial use that take into consideration environmental impacts, and especially effects on the preservation of native species, salmon recovery, and threatened or endangered species.</p>

<p>If the department determines it is necessary to protect the environmental, economic, or human health interests of the state from the threat of a prohibited level 1 or level 2 species, the department may declare a quarantine against a water body, property, or region within the state. The department may prohibit or condition the movement of aquatic conveyances and waters from such a quarantined place or area that are likely to contain a prohibited species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quarantine declaration under this section may be implemented separately or in conjunction with rapid response management actions under RCW 77.135.060 and infested site management actions under RCW 77.135.070 in a manner and for a duration necessary to protect the interests of the state from the threat of a prohibited level 1 or level 2 species.

Rapid response management actions may: Include expedited actions to contain, control, or eradicate the prohibited species; and, if applicable, be implemented in conjunction with a quarantine declaration. Rapid response management actions must be terminated by the department when it determines that the targeted prohibited level 1 species are:</p>

<li>
<p>If a rapid response management action exceeds seven days, the department may implement an incident command system for rapid response management including scope, duration, and types of actions and to support mutual assistance and cooperation between the department and other affected state and federal agencies, tribes, local governments, and private water body or property owners. The purpose of this system is to coordinate a rapid, effective, and efficient response to contain, control, and eradicate if feasible, a prohibited level 1 species. Mutual assistance and coordination by other state agencies is especially important to assist the department in expediting necessary state and federal environmental permits.</p>
</li>
<li>

The director's findings must contain an evaluation of the effect of the emergency measures on environmental factors such as fish listed under the endangered species act, economic factors such as public and private access, human health factors such as water quality, or well-being factors such as cultural resources.</p>

<p>If an emergency is declared pursuant to RCW 43.06.010(14), the director may consult with the invasive species council to advise the governor on emergency measures necessary under RCW 43.06.010(14) and this section, and make subsequent recommendations to the governor.

<p>Upon the governor's approval of emergency measures, the director may implement these measures to prevent, contain, control, or eradicate invasive species that are the subject of the emergency order, notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 15.58 or 17.21 RCW or any other statute. These measures, after evaluation of all other alternatives, may include the surface and aerial application of pesticides.</p>
