<p>The legislature finds that repeated attempts to improve salmonid fish runs throughout the state of Washington have failed to avert listings of salmon and steelhead runs as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.). These listings threaten the sport, commercial, and tribal fishing industries as well as the economic well-being and vitality of vast areas of the state. It is the intent of the legislature to begin activities required for the recovery of salmon stocks as soon as possible, although the legislature understands that successful recovery efforts may not be realized for many years because of the life cycle of salmon and the complex array of natural and human-caused problems they face.</p>
<p>The legislature finds that it is in the interest of the citizens of the state of Washington for the state to retain primary responsibility for managing the natural resources of the state, rather than abdicate those responsibilities to the federal government, and that the state may best accomplish this objective by integrating local and regional recovery activities into a statewide strategy that can make the most effective use of provisions of federal laws allowing for a state lead in salmon recovery, delivered through implementation activities consistent with regional and watershed recovery plans. The legislature also finds that a statewide salmon recovery strategy must be developed and implemented through an active public involvement process in order to ensure public participation in, and support for, salmon recovery. The legislature also finds that there is a substantial link between the provisions of the federal endangered species act and the federal clean water act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1251 et seq.). The legislature further finds that habitat restoration is a vital component of salmon recovery efforts. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to specifically address salmon habitat restoration in a coordinated manner and to develop a structure that allows for the coordinated delivery of federal, state, and local assistance to communities for habitat projects that will assist in the recovery and enhancement of salmon stocks. A strong watershed-based locally implemented plan is essential for local, regional, and statewide salmon recovery.</p>
<p>The legislature also finds that credible scientific review and oversight is essential for any salmon recovery effort to be successful.</p>
<p>The legislature further finds that it is important to monitor the overall health of the salmon resource to determine if recovery efforts are providing expected returns. It is important to monitor salmon habitat projects and salmon recovery activities to determine their effectiveness in order to secure federal acceptance of the state's approach to salmon recovery. Adaptive management cannot exist without monitoring. For these reasons, the legislature believes that a coordinated and integrated monitoring system should be developed and implemented.</p>
<p>The legislature therefore finds that a coordinated framework for responding to the salmon crisis is needed immediately. To that end, the governor's salmon recovery office should be created to provide overall coordination of the state's response; an independent science panel is needed to provide scientific review and oversight; a coordinated state funding process should be established through a salmon recovery funding board; the appropriate local or tribal government should provide local leadership in identifying and sequencing habitat projects to be funded by state agencies; habitat projects should be implemented without delay; and a strong locally based effort to restore salmon habitat should be established by providing a framework to allow citizen volunteers to work effectively.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The governor shall, with the assistance of the governor's salmon recovery office, maintain and revise, as appropriate, a statewide salmon recovery strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The governor and the governor's salmon recovery office shall be guided by the following considerations in maintaining and revising the strategy:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The strategy should identify statewide initiatives and responsibilities with regional recovery plans and local watershed initiatives as the principal means for implementing the strategy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strategy should emphasize collaborative, incentive-based approaches;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strategy should address all factors limiting the recovery of Washington's listed salmon stocks, including habitat and water quality degradation, harvest and hatchery management, inadequate streamflows, and other barriers to fish passage. Where other limiting factors are beyond the state's jurisdictional authorities to respond to, such as some natural predators and high seas fishing, the strategy shall include the state's requests for federal action to effectively address these factors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strategy should identify immediate actions necessary to prevent extinction of a listed salmon stock, establish performance measures to determine if restoration efforts are working, recommend effective monitoring and data management, and recommend to the legislature clear and certain measures to be implemented if performance goals are not met;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strategy shall rely on the best scientific information available and provide for incorporation of new information as it is obtained;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strategy should seek a fair allocation of the burdens and costs upon economic and social sectors of the state whose activities may contribute to limiting the recovery of salmon; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strategy should seek clear measures and procedures from the appropriate federal agencies for removing Washington's salmon stocks from listing under the federal act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the strategy is updated, an active and thorough public involvement process, including early and meaningful opportunity for public comment, must be utilized. In obtaining public comment, the governor's salmon recovery office shall work with regional salmon recovery organizations throughout the state and shall encourage regional and local recovery planning efforts to ensure an active public involvement process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section shall apply prospectively only and not retroactively. Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate actions taken in recovery planning at the local, regional, or state level prior to July 1, 1999.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that the forests and fish report as defined in RCW 76.09.020 was developed through extensive negotiations with the federal agencies responsible for administering the endangered species act and the clean water act. The legislature further finds that the forestry industry, small landowners, tribal governments, state and federal agencies, and counties have worked diligently for nearly two years to reach agreement on scientifically based changes to the forest practices rules, set forth in the forests and fish report as defined in RCW 76.09.020. The legislature further finds that if existing forest practices rules are amended as proposed in the forests and fish report as defined in RCW 76.09.020, the resulting changes in forest practices (a) will lead to: (i) Salmon habitat that meets riparian functions vital to the long-term recovery of salmon on more than sixty thousand miles of streams in this state; (ii) identification of forest roads contributing to habitat degradation and corrective action to remedy those problems to protect salmon habitat; (iii) increased protection of steep and unstable slopes; and (iv) the implementation of scientifically based adaptive management and monitoring processes for evaluating the impacts of forest practices on aquatic resources, as defined in RCW 76.09.020, and a process for amending the forest practices rules to incorporate new information as it becomes available; (b) will lead to the protection of aquatic resources to the maximum extent practicable consistent with maintaining commercial forest management as an economically viable use of lands suitable for that purpose; and (c) will provide a regulatory climate and structure more likely to keep landowners from converting forestlands to other uses that would be less desirable for salmon recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that the changes in laws and rules contemplated by chapter 4, Laws of 1999 sp. sess., taken as a whole, constitute a comprehensive and coordinated program to provide substantial and sufficient contributions to salmon recovery and water quality enhancement in areas impacted by forest practices and are intended to fully satisfy the requirements of the endangered species act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.) with respect to incidental take of salmon and other aquatic resources and the clean water act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1251 et seq.) with respect to nonpoint source pollution attributable to forest practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature finds that coordination is needed between the laws relating to forestry in chapter 76.09 RCW and the state salmon recovery strategy being developed under this chapter. The coordination should ensure that nonfederal forestlands are managed in ways that make appropriate contributions to the recovery of salmonid fish, water quality, and related environmental amenities while encouraging continued investments in those lands for commercial forestry purposes. Specifically, the legislature finds that forest practices rules relating to water quality, salmon, certain other species of fish, certain species of stream-associated amphibians, and their respective habitats should be coordinated with the rules and policies relating to other land uses through the statewide salmon recovery planning process. The legislature further finds that this subchapter is but one part of a comprehensive salmon strategy as required in this chapter, and this investment in salmon habitat will be of little value if a comprehensive state plan is not completed and fully implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature recognizes that the adoption of forest practices rules consistent with the forests and fish report as defined in RCW 76.09.020 will impose substantial financial burdens on forestland owners which, if not partially offset through other changes in the laws and rules governing forestry, could lead to significantly reduced silvicultural investments on nonfederal lands, deterioration in the quality, condition, and amounts of forests on those lands, and long-term adverse effects on fish and wildlife habitat and other environmental amenities associated with well managed forests. Moreover, as the benefits of the proposed revisions to the forest practices rules will benefit the general public, chapter 4, Laws of 1999 sp. sess. suggests that some of these costs be shared with the general public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an integral part of implementing the salmon recovery strategy, chapter 4, Laws of 1999 sp. sess. (a) provides direction to the forest practices board, the department of natural resources, and the department of ecology with respect to the adoption, implementation, and enforcement of rules relating to forest practices and the protection of aquatic resources; (b) provides additional enforcement tools to the department of natural resources to enforce the forest practices rules; (c) anticipates the need for adequate and consistent funding for the various programmatic elements necessary to fully implement the strategy over time and derive the long-term benefits; (d) provides for the acquisition by the state of forestlands within certain stream channel migration zones where timber harvest will not be allowed; (e) provides for small landowners to have costs shared for a portion of any extraordinary economic losses attributable to the revisions to the forest practices rules required by chapter 4, Laws of 1999 sp. sess.; and (f) amends other existing laws to aid in the implementation of the recommendations set forth in the forests and fish report as defined in RCW 76.09.020.</p>

<li>
<p>In consultation with the appropriate task force formed under RCW 77.85.220, the conservation commission may contract with universities, private consultants, nonprofit groups, or other entities to assist it in developing a plan incorporating the following elements:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>An inventory of existing tide gates located on streams in the county. The inventory shall include location, age, type, and maintenance history of the tide gates and other factors as determined by the appropriate task force in consultation with the county and diking and drainage districts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assessment of the role of tide gates located on streams in the county; the role of intertidal fish habitat for various life stages of salmon; the quantity and characterization of intertidal fish habitat currently accessible to fish; the quantity and characterization of the present intertidal fish habitat created at the time the dikes and outlets were constructed; the quantity of potential intertidal fish habitat on public lands and alternatives to enhance this habitat; the effects of saltwater intrusion on agricultural land, including the effects of backfeeding of salt water through the underground drainage system; the role of tide gates in drainage systems, including relieving excess water from saturated soil and providing reservoir functions between tides; the effect of saturated soils on production of crops; the characteristics of properly functioning intertidal fish habitat; a map of agricultural lands designated by the county as having long-term commercial significance and the effect of that designation; and the economic impacts to existing land uses for various alternatives for tide gate alteration; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A long-term plan for intertidal salmon habitat enhancement to meet the goals of salmon recovery and protection of agricultural lands. The proposal shall consider all other means to achieve salmon recovery without converting farmland. The proposal shall include methods to increase fish passage and otherwise enhance intertidal habitat on public lands pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, voluntary methods to increase fish passage on private lands, a priority list of intertidal salmon enhancement projects, and recommendations for funding of high priority projects. The task force also may propose pilot projects that will be designed to test and measure the success of various proposed strategies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conjunction with other public landowners and the appropriate task force formed under RCW 77.85.220, the department shall develop an initial salmon intertidal habitat enhancement plan for public lands in the county. The initial plan shall include a list of public properties in the intertidal zone that could be enhanced for salmon, a description of how those properties could be altered to support salmon, a description of costs and sources of funds to enhance the property, and a strategy and schedule for prioritizing the enhancement of public lands for intertidal salmon habitat. This initial plan shall be submitted to the appropriate task force at least six months before the deadline established in subsection (3) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final intertidal salmon enhancement plan shall be completed within two years from the date the task force is formed under RCW 77.85.220 and funding has been secured. A final plan shall be submitted by the appropriate task force to the lead entity for the geographic area established under this chapter.</p>
