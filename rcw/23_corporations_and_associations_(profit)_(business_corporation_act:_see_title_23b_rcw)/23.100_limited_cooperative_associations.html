</li>
<li>
<p>A limited cooperative association may not make a distribution, including a distribution under RCW 23.100.1008, if after the distribution:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The association would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the association's activities and affairs; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the association were to be dissolved and wound up at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution and winding up of members whose preferential rights are superior to the rights of persons receiving the distribution.</p>
