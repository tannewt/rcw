<li>
<p>The legislature finds that children who are deaf or hard of hearing and their families have unique needs specific to the hearing loss. These unique needs reflect the challenges children with hearing loss and their families encounter related to their lack of full access to auditory communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legislature further finds that early detection of hearing loss in a child and early intervention and treatment have been demonstrated to be highly effective in facilitating a child's healthy development in a manner consistent with the child's age and cognitive ability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These combined factors support the need for early intervention services providers with specialized training and expertise, spanning the spectrum of available approaches and educational options, who can address the unique characteristics and needs of each child who is deaf or hard of hearing and that child's family.</p>
