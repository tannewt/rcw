<p>The good health of the people of our state is a most important public concern. The state has a direct interest in seeing to it that health care facilities adequate for good public health are established and maintained in sufficient numbers and in proper locations. The rising costs of care of the infirm constitute a grave challenge not only to health care providers but to our state and the people of our state who will seek such care. It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the state of Washington to assist and encourage the building, providing and utilization of modern, well equipped and reasonably priced health care facilities, and the improvement, expansion and modernization of health care facilities in a manner that will minimize the capital costs of construction, financing and use thereof and thereby the costs to the public of the use of such facilities, and to contribute to improving the quality of health care available to our citizens. In order to accomplish these and related purposes this chapter is adopted and shall be liberally construed to carry out its purposes and objects.</p>

<li>
<p>The authority is hereby empowered to issue bonds for the construction, purchase, acquisition, rental, leasing or use by participants of projects for which bonds to provide funds therefor have been approved by the authority. Such bonds shall be issued in the name of the authority. They shall not be obligations of the state of Washington or general obligations of the authority but shall be payable only from the special funds created by the authority for their payment. They shall contain a recital on their face that their payment and the payment of interest thereon shall be a valid claim only as against the special fund relating thereto derived by the authority in whole or in part from the revenues received by the authority from the operation by the participant of the health care facilities for which the bonds are issued but that they shall constitute a prior charge over all other charges or claims whatever against such special fund. The lien of any such pledge on such revenues shall attach thereto immediately on their receipt by the authority and shall be valid and binding as against parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the participant, without recordation thereof and whether or not they have notice thereof. For inclusion in such special funds and for other uses in or for such projects of participants the authority is empowered to accept and receive funds, grants, gifts, pledges, guarantees, mortgages, trust deeds and other security instruments, and property from the federal government or the state of Washington or other public body, entity or agency and from any public or private institution, association, corporation or organization, including participants, except that it shall not accept or receive from the state or any taxing agency any money derived from taxes save money to be devoted to the purposes of a project of the state or taxing agency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the purposes outlined in subsection (1) of this section the authority is empowered to provide for the issuance of its special fund bonds and other limited obligation security instruments subordinate to the first and prior lien bonds, if any, relating to a project or projects of a participant and to create special funds relating thereto against which such subordinate securities shall be liens, but the authority shall not have power to incur general obligations with respect thereto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority may also issue special fund bonds to redeem or to fund or refund outstanding bonds or any part thereof at maturity, or before maturity if subject to prior redemption, with the right in the authority to include various series and issues of such outstanding special fund bonds in a single issue of funding or refunding special fund bonds and to pay any redemption premiums out of the proceeds thereto. Such funding or refunding bonds shall be limited special fund bonds issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, including this section and shall not be general obligations of the authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such special fund bonds of either first lien or subordinate lien nature may also be issued by the authority, the proceeds of which may be used to refund already existing mortgages or other obligations on health care facilities already constructed and operating incurred by a participant in the construction, purchase or acquisition thereof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authority may also lease to participants, lease to them with option to purchase, or sell to them, facilities which it has acquired by construction, purchase, devise, gift, or leasing: PROVIDED, That the terms thereof shall at least fully reimburse the authority for its costs with respect to such facilities, including costs of financing, and provide fully for the debt service on any bonds issued by the authority to finance acquisition by it of the facilities. To pay the cost of acquiring or improving such facilities or to refund any bonds issued for such purpose, the authority may issue its revenue bonds secured solely by revenues derived from the sale or lease of the facility, but which may additionally be secured by mortgage, lease, pledge or assignment, trust agreement or other security device. Such bonds and such security devices shall not be obligations of the state of Washington or general obligations of the authority but shall be payable only from the special funds created by the authority for their payment. Such health care facilities may be acquired, constructed, reconstructed, and improved and may be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of in the manner determined by the authority in its sole discretion and any requirement of competitive bidding, lease performance bonds or other restriction imposed on the procedure for award of contracts for such purpose or the lease, sale or other disposition of property of the state, or any agency thereof, is not applicable to any action so taken by the authority.</p>

<p>The authority shall establish rules concerning its exercise of the powers authorized by this chapter. The authority shall receive from applicants requests for the providing of bonds for financing of health care facilities and shall investigate and determine the need and the feasibility of providing such bonds. Whenever the authority deems it necessary or advisable for the benefit of the public health to provide financing for a health care facility, it shall adopt a financing plan therefor and shall declare the estimated cost thereof, as near as may be, including as part of such cost funds necessary for the expenses incurred in the financing as well as in the construction or purchase or other acquisition or in connection with the rental or other payment for the use thereof, interest during construction, reserve funds and any funds necessary for initial start-up costs, and shall issue and sell its bonds for the purposes of carrying out the proposed financing plan: PROVIDED, That if a certificate of need is required for the proposed project, no such financing plan shall be adopted until such certificate has been issued pursuant to chapter 70.38 RCW by the secretary of the department of social and health services. The authority shall have power as a part of such plan to create a special fund or funds for the purpose of defraying the cost of such project and for other projects of the same participant subsequently or at the same time approved by it and for their maintenance, improvement, reconstruction, remodeling, and rehabilitation, into which special fund or funds it shall obligate and bind the participant to set aside and pay from the gross revenues of the project or from other sources an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the bonds being issued, reserves and other requirements of the special fund and to issue and sell bonds payable as to both principal and interest out of such fund or funds relating to the project or projects of such participant.</p>
<p>Such bonds shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, or both, as provided in RCW 39.46.030, carry such registration privileges, be made transferable, exchangeable, and interchangeable, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, be subject to such terms of redemption, bear such fixed or variable rate or rates of interest, and be sold in such manner, at such price, as the authority shall determine. Such bonds shall be executed by the chair, by either its duly elected secretary or its executive director, and by the trustee if the authority determines to utilize a trustee for the bonds. Execution of the bonds may be by manual or facsimile signature: PROVIDED, That at least one signature placed thereon shall be manually subscribed. Any interest coupons appurtenant to the bonds shall be executed by facsimile or manual signature or signatures, as the authority shall determine.</p>
