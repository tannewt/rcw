The board shall accept recommendations from the advisory committee on data issues and the advisory committee of health care providers and carriers regarding the value and feasibility of reporting various categories of information under (c) of this subsection, such as urban and rural, public sector and private sector, and major categories of health services, including prescription drugs, inpatient treatment, and outpatient treatment;</p>
