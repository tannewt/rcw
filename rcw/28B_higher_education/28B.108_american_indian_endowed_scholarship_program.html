<p>The legislature recognizes the benefit to our state and nation of providing equal educational opportunities for all races and nationalities. The legislature finds that American Indian students are underrepresented in Washington's colleges and universities. The legislature also finds that past discriminatory practices have resulted in this underrepresentation. Creating an endowed scholarship program to help American Indian students obtain a higher education will help to rectify past discrimination by providing a means and an incentive for American Indian students to pursue a higher education. The state will benefit from contributions made by American Indians who participate in a program of higher education.</p>

The student's scholarship awarded under this chapter shall not exceed the amount received by a student attending a state research university. A student is eligible to receive a scholarship for a maximum of five years. However, the length of the scholarship shall be determined at the discretion of the office.</p>
