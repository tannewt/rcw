<li>
<p>It is in the public interest to reduce domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking by enabling victims to maintain the financial independence necessary to leave abusive situations, achieve safety, and minimize physical and emotional injuries, and to reduce the devastating economic consequences of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking to employers and employees. Victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking should be able to recover from and cope with the effects of such violence and participate in criminal and civil justice processes without fear of adverse economic consequences. Victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking should also be able to seek and maintain employment without fear that they will face discrimination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best predictors of whether a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking will be able to stay away from an abuser is his or her degree of economic independence. However, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking often negatively impact victims' ability to maintain employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or an employee whose family member is a victim, must often take leave from work due to injuries, court proceedings, or safety concerns requiring legal protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, it is in the public interest to provide reasonable leave from employment for employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or for employees whose family members are victims, to participate in legal proceedings, receive medical treatment, or obtain other necessary services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also in the public interest to ensure that victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking are able to seek and maintain employment without fear of discrimination and to have reasonable safety accommodations in the workplace.</p>

<p>As a condition of taking leave for any purpose described in RCW 49.76.030, an employee shall give an employer advance notice of the employee's intention to take leave. The timing of the notice shall be consistent with the employer's stated policy for requesting such leave, if the employer has such a policy. When advance notice cannot be given because of an emergency or unforeseen circumstances due to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the employee or his or her designee must give notice to the employer no later than the end of the first day that the employee takes such leave.</p>

<li>
<p>When an employee requests leave under RCW 49.76.030 or requests a reasonable safety accommodation under RCW 49.76.115 the employer may require that the request be supported by verification that:</p>
