<p>When property liable to an execution against several persons is sold on execution, if more than a due proportion of the judgment is levied upon the property of one person, or one of them pays without a sale more than his or her due proportion, that person may compel contribution from the others. When a judgment against several persons is upon an obligation or contract of one of them as security for another, if the surety pays the full amount or any part of the judgment, either by sale of the surety's property or before sale, the surety may compel repayment from the principal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In either case covered by subsection (1) of this section, the person or surety so paying shall be entitled to the benefit of the judgment to enforce contribution or repayment, if within thirty days after the payment, notice of the payment and claim to contribution or repayment is filed with the clerk of the court where the judgment was rendered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon filing such notice, the clerk shall make an entry thereof in the docket where the judgment is entered.</p>

<p>If, before levying under a writ of attachment or execution, a sheriff receives notice that the defendant has become a debtor in a bankruptcy case, the sheriff shall immediately give written notice of that fact to the plaintiff's attorney of record, if any, otherwise to the plaintiff, and shall not be bound to levy under the writ. If, after levying on property under a writ of attachment or execution, a sheriff receives such notice, the sheriff shall give written notice of the attachment or execution, describing the property seized, to the trustee in the bankruptcy case if there is one, otherwise to the bankruptcy court, with a copy to the plaintiff's attorney of record, if any, otherwise to the plaintiff, and shall transfer the property to the trustee on demand or as the bankruptcy court otherwise directs. If no demand is made on the sheriff for surrender of the property and the sheriff thereafter receives notice of the closing of the bankruptcy case, the sheriff shall give written notice by first-class mail to the plaintiff's attorney of record, if any, otherwise to the plaintiff, requiring that the plaintiff release the property or obtain a renewal of the writ from the court, and, if the plaintiff fails to release the property or to apply for a renewal within fourteen days after the mailing of the sheriff's notice, the sheriff shall release the property to the defendant.</p>
