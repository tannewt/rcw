<p>Whenever it appears that the inner harbor line of any harbor area has been so established as to overlap or fall inside the government meander line, or for any other good cause, the board acting as the harbor line commission is empowered to relocate and reestablish said inner harbor line so erroneously established, outside of the meander line. All tidelands or shorelands within the inner harbor line so reestablished and relocated, shall belong to the state and may be sold or leased as other first-class tidelands or shorelands in accordance with the provisions of RCW 79.125.200.
