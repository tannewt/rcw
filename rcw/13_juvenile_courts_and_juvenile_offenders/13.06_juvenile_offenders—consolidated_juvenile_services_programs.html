<p>It is the intention of the legislature in enacting this chapter to increase the protection afforded the citizens of this state, to require community planning, to provide necessary services and supervision for juvenile offenders in the community when appropriate, to reduce reliance on state-operated correctional institutions for offenders whose standard range disposition does not include commitment of the offender to the department, and to encourage the community to efficiently and effectively provide community services to juvenile offenders through consolidation of service delivery systems.</p>

<p>The department of children, youth, and families shall adopt rules prescribing minimum standards for the operation of consolidated juvenile services programs for juvenile offenders and such other rules as may be necessary for the administration of the provisions of this chapter. Consolidated juvenile services is a mechanism through which the department of children, youth, and families supports local county comprehensive program plans in providing services to offender groups. Standards shall be sufficiently flexible to support current programs which have demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency, to foster development of innovative and improved services for juvenile offenders, to permit direct contracting with private vendors, and to encourage community support for and assistance to local programs. The secretary of children, youth, and families shall seek advice from appropriate juvenile justice system participants in developing standards and procedures for the operation of consolidated juvenile services programs and the distribution of funds under this chapter.</p>
