<p>The legislature finds that within any group of people there exists a need for guidelines for acceptable behavior and that, presumptively, the experience and maturity of parents make them better qualified to establish guidelines beneficial to and protective of their children. The legislature further finds that it is the right and responsibility of adults to establish laws for the benefit and protection of the society; and that, in the same manner, the right and responsibility for establishing reasonable guidelines for the family unit belongs to the adults within that unit. Further, absent abuse or neglect, parents have the right to exercise control over their children. The legislature reaffirms its position stated in RCW 13.34.020 that the family unit is the fundamental resource of American life which should be nurtured and that it should remain intact in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes there is a need for services and assistance for parents and children who are in conflict. These conflicts are manifested by children who exhibit various behaviors including: Running away, substance abuse, serious acting out problems, mental health needs, and other behaviors that endanger themselves or others.</p>
<p>The legislature finds many parents do not know their rights regarding their adolescent children and law enforcement. Parents and courts feel they have insufficient legal recourse for the chronic runaway child who is endangering himself or herself through his or her behavior. The legislature further recognizes that for chronic runaways whose behavior puts them in serious danger of harming themselves or others, secure facilities must be provided to allow opportunities for assessment, treatment, and to assist parents and protect their children. The legislature intends to give tools to parents, courts, and law enforcement to keep families together and reunite them whenever possible.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that some children run away to protect themselves from abuse or neglect in their homes. Abused and neglected children should be dealt with pursuant to chapter 13.34 RCW and it is not the intent of the legislature to handle dependency matters under this chapter.</p>
<p>The legislature intends services offered under this chapter be on a voluntary basis whenever possible to children and their families and that the courts be used as a last resort.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to increase the safety of children through the preservation of families and the provision of assessment, treatment, and placement services for children in need of services and at-risk youth including services and assessments conducted under chapter 13.32A RCW and *RCW 74.13.033. Within available funds, the legislature intends to provide these services through crisis residential centers in which children and youth may safely reside for a limited period of time. The time in residence shall be used to conduct an assessment of the needs of the children, youth, and their families. The assessments are necessary to identify appropriate services and placement options that will reduce the likelihood that children will place themselves in dangerous or life-threatening situations.</p>
<p>The legislature recognizes that crisis residential centers provide an opportunity for children to receive short-term necessary support and nurturing in cases where there may be abuse or neglect. The legislature intends that center staff provide an atmosphere of concern, care, and respect for children in the center and their parents.</p>
<p>The legislature intends to provide for the protection of children who, through their behavior, are endangering themselves. The legislature intends to provide appropriate residential services, including secure facilities, to protect, stabilize, and treat children with serious problems. The legislature further intends to empower parents by providing them with the assistance they require to raise their children.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the legislature to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Preserve, strengthen, and reconcile families experiencing problems with at-risk youth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a legal process by which parents who are experiencing problems with at-risk youth can request and receive assistance from juvenile courts in providing appropriate care, treatment, and supervision to such youth; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess the effectiveness of the family reconciliation services program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The legislature does not intend by this enactment to grant any parent the right to file an at-risk youth petition or receive juvenile court assistance in dealing with an at-risk youth. The purpose of chapter 276, Laws of 1990 is to create a process by which a parent of an at-risk youth may request and receive assistance subject to the availability of juvenile court services and resources. Recognizing that these services and resources are limited, the legislature intends that counties have the authority to impose reasonable limits on the utilization of juvenile court services and resources in matters related to at-risk youth. Any responsibilities imposed upon the department under chapter 276, Laws of 1990 shall be contingent upon the availability of funds specifically appropriated by the legislature for such purpose.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the juvenile court shall not accept the filing of a child in need of services petition by the child or the parents or the filing of an at-risk youth petition by the parent, unless verification is provided that the department, or a community-based entity under contract with the department, has completed a family assessment. The family assessment shall involve the multidisciplinary team if one exists. The family assessment or plan of services developed by the multidisciplinary team shall be aimed at family reconciliation, reunification, and avoidance of the out-of-home placement of the child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A child or a child's parent may file with the juvenile court a child in need of services petition to approve an out-of-home placement for the child before completion of a family assessment. The department shall, when requested, assist either a parent or child in the filing of the petition. The petition must be filed in the county where the parent resides. The petition shall allege that the child is a child in need of services and shall ask only that the placement of a child outside the home of his or her parent be approved. The filing of a petition to approve the placement is not dependent upon the court's having obtained any prior jurisdiction over the child or his or her parent, and confers upon the court a special jurisdiction to approve or disapprove an out-of-home placement under this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A petition may not be filed if the child is the subject of a proceeding under chapter 13.34 RCW.</p>

<p>A child's parent may file with the juvenile court a petition in the interest of a child alleged to be an at-risk youth. The department shall, when requested, assist the parent in filing the petition. The petition shall be filed in the county where the petitioner resides. The petition shall set forth the name, age, and residence of the child and the names and residence of the child's parents and shall allege that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The child is an at-risk youth;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The petitioner has the right to legal custody of the child;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Court intervention and supervision are necessary to assist the parent to maintain the care, custody, and control of the child; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatives to court intervention have been attempted or there is good cause why such alternatives have not been attempted.</p>
</li>

<p>The petition shall set forth facts that support the allegations in this section and shall generally request relief available under this chapter. The petition need not specify any proposed disposition following adjudication of the petition. The filing of an at-risk youth petition is not dependent upon the court's having obtained any prior jurisdiction over the child or his or her parent and confers upon the court the special jurisdiction to assist the parent in maintaining parental authority and responsibility for the child.</p>

<p>In a disposition hearing, after a finding that a child is a child in need of services or an at-risk youth, the court may adopt the additional orders authorized under this section if it finds that the child involved in those proceedings is not eligible for inpatient treatment for a mental health or substance abuse condition and requires specialized treatment. The court may order that a child be placed in a staff secure facility, other than a crisis residential center, that will provide for the child's participation in a program designed to remedy his or her behavioral difficulties or needs. The court may not enter this order unless, at the disposition hearing, it finds that the placement is clearly necessary to protect the child and that a less restrictive order would be inadequate to protect the child, given the child's age, maturity, propensity to run away from home, past exposure to serious risk when the child ran away from home, and possible future exposure to serious risk should the child run away from home again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The order shall require periodic court review of the placement, with the first review hearing conducted not more than thirty days after the date of the placement. At each review hearing the court shall advise the parents of their rights under RCW 13.32A.160(1), review the progress of the child, and determine whether the orders are still necessary for the protection of the child or a less restrictive placement would be adequate. The court shall modify its orders as it finds necessary to protect the child. Reviews of orders adopted under this section are subject to the review provisions under RCW 13.32A.190 and 13.32.198 [13.32A.198].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Placements in staff secure facilities under this section shall be limited to children who meet the statutory definition of a child in need of services or an at-risk youth as defined in RCW 13.32A.030.</p>

Parental authority is appropriate in areas that are not connected with the abuse or neglect that resulted in the dependency and should be integrated through the foster care team.</p>

<li>
<p>In all child in need of services proceedings and at-risk youth proceedings, the court shall verbally notify the parents and the child of the possibility of a finding of contempt for failure to comply with the terms of a court order entered pursuant to this chapter and the possible consequences thereof, including confinement when applicable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the court shall treat the parents and the child equally for the purposes of applying contempt of court processes and penalties under this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure by a party in an at-risk youth proceeding to comply with an order entered under this chapter is a civil contempt of court as provided in RCW 7.21.030(2)(e), subject to the limitations of subsection (3) of this section.</p>

<p>The court may impose remedial sanctions including a fine of up to one hundred dollars and confinement for up to seventy-two hours, or both for contempt of court under this section if (A) one of the less restrictive alternatives under (a) of this subsection has been attempted and another violation of the order has occurred, or (B) the court issues a formal finding that none of the less restrictive alternatives is available. The seventy-two hour period excludes Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays and shall commence upon the next nonholiday weekday following the court order and shall run to the end of the last nonholiday weekday within the seventy-two hour period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A child placed in confinement for contempt under this section shall be placed in confinement only in a secure juvenile detention facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with a county.</p>

<li>
<p>A child involved in a child in need of services proceeding may not be placed in confinement under this section.</p>

<li>
<p>A motion for contempt may be made by a parent, a child, juvenile court personnel, or by any public agency, organization, or person having custody of the child under a court order adopted pursuant to this chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For at-risk youth proceedings only, whenever the court finds probable cause to believe, based upon consideration of a motion for contempt and the information set forth in a supporting declaration, that a child has violated a placement order entered under this chapter, the court must direct the court clerk to command the presence of the child by the issuance of a summons or other method approved by local court rule instead of a warrant, unless the court finds probable cause to believe that the child would not appear in response to the command or finds probable cause to believe that the arrest is necessary to prevent serious bodily harm to the juvenile or another, in which case the court may issue a warrant. A warrant of arrest must be supported by an affidavit or sworn testimony, which must be recorded electronically or by stenographer, establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. The warrant of arrest for a child under this subsection may not be served on a child inside of school during school hours in a location where other students are present if the child named in the warrant is a pupil at the school. The court must communicate the summons to the child through mail, telephone, text message, or other method of communication needed in order to ensure the child has received the information. If the child fails to appear via the summons or other method, the court may issue an order directing law enforcement to pick up and take the child to detention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the court's inherent contempt power or curtail its exercise.</p>
