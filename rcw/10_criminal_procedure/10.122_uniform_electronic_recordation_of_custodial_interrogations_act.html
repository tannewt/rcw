<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided by RCW 10.122.050 through 10.122.100, a custodial interrogation, including the giving of any required warning, advice of the rights of the individual being questioned, and the waiver of any rights by the individual, must be recorded electronically in its entirety if the interrogation subject is a juvenile or if the interrogation relates to a felony crime.

A custodial interrogation at any other place of detention must be recorded by audio means at minimum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a law enforcement officer conducts a custodial interrogation to which subsection (1) of this section applies without electronically recording it in its entirety, the officer shall prepare a written or electronic report explaining the reason for not complying with this section and summarizing the custodial interrogation process and the individual's statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A law enforcement officer shall prepare the report required by subsection (2) of this section as soon as practicable after completing the interrogation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding RCW 9.73.030 and 9.73.090, a law enforcement officer conducting a custodial interrogation is not required to obtain consent to electronic recording from the individual being interrogated, but must inform the individual that an electronic recording is being made of the interrogation. This chapter does not permit a law enforcement officer or a law enforcement agency to record a private communication between an individual and the individual's lawyer.</p>

<p>A custodial interrogation to which RCW 10.122.030 otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically if the individual to be interrogated indicates that the individual will not participate in the interrogation if it is recorded electronically.

</li>
<li>
<p>If, during a custodial interrogation to which RCW 10.122.030 otherwise applies, the individual being interrogated indicates that the individual will not participate in further interrogation unless electronic recording ceases, the remainder of the custodial interrogation need not be recorded electronically. If feasible, the individual's agreement to participate without further recording must be recorded electronically.</p>

<p>A law enforcement officer, with intent to avoid the requirement of electronic recording in RCW 10.122.030, may not encourage an individual to request that a recording not be made.</p>

<p>A custodial interrogation to which RCW 10.122.030 otherwise applies need not be recorded electronically if the interrogation occurs when no law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation has knowledge of facts and circumstances that would lead an officer reasonably to believe that the individual being interrogated may have committed an act for which RCW 10.122.030 requires that a custodial interrogation be recorded electronically.</p>

If feasible and consistent with the safety of a confidential informant, an explanation of the basis for the belief that electronic recording would disclose the informant's identity must be recorded electronically at the time of the interrogation.
