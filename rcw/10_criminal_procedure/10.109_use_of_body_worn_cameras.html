<li>
<p>A law enforcement or corrections agency that deploys body worn cameras must establish policies regarding the use of the cameras. The policies must, at a minimum, address:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>When a body worn camera must be activated and deactivated, and when a law enforcement or corrections officer has the discretion to activate and deactivate the body worn camera;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How a law enforcement or corrections officer is to respond to circumstances when it would be reasonably anticipated that a person may be unwilling or less willing to communicate with an officer who is recording the communication with a body worn camera;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How a law enforcement or corrections officer will document when and why a body worn camera was deactivated prior to the conclusion of an interaction with a member of the public while conducting official law enforcement or corrections business;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How, and under what circumstances, a law enforcement or corrections officer is to inform a member of the public that he or she is being recorded, including in situations where the person is a non-English speaker or has limited English proficiency, or where the person is deaf or hard of hearing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How officers are to be trained on body worn camera usage and how frequently the training is to be reviewed or renewed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security rules to protect data collected and stored from body worn cameras.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A law enforcement or corrections agency that deploys body worn cameras before June 9, 2016, must establish the policies within one hundred twenty days of June 9, 2016. A law enforcement or corrections agency that deploys body worn cameras on or after June 9, 2016, must establish the policies before deploying body worn cameras.</p>

<p>For a city or town that is not deploying body worn cameras on June 9, 2016, a legislative authority of a city or town is strongly encouraged to adopt an ordinance or resolution authorizing the use of body worn cameras prior to their use by law enforcement or a corrections agency. Any ordinance or resolution authorizing the use of body worn cameras should identify a community involvement process for providing input into the development of operational policies governing the use of body worn cameras.</p>
