<li>
<p>In making an allocation or determination or exercising discretion under this chapter, a fiduciary shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Act in good faith, based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administer a trust or estate impartially, except to the extent the terms of the trust manifest an intent that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more beneficiaries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administer the trust or estate in accordance with the terms of the trust, even if there is a different provision in this chapter; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administer the trust or estate in accordance with this chapter, except to the extent the terms of the trust provide otherwise or authorize the fiduciary to determine otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary's allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust, and an exercise of the power which produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this chapter does not create an inference that the fiduciary abused the fiduciary's discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary shall:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Add a receipt to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the receipt between income and principal; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charge a disbursement to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the disbursement between income and principal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under RCW 11.104B.070, convert an income trust to a unitrust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(a), change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(c), if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power is necessary to administer the trust or estate in accordance with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factors the fiduciary must consider in making the determination under subsection (4) of this section include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The terms of the trust;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nature, distribution standards, and expected duration of the trust;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect of the allocation rules, including specific adjustments between income and principal, under Articles 4 through 7 of this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desirability of liquidity and regularity of income;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desirability of the preservation and appreciation of principal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which an asset is used or may be used by a beneficiary;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increase or decrease in the value of principal assets, reasonably determined by the fiduciary;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the fiduciary power to accumulate income or invade principal or prohibit the fiduciary from accumulating income or invading principal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extent to which the fiduciary has accumulated income or invaded principal in preceding accounting periods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect of current and reasonably expected economic conditions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasonably expected tax consequences of the exercise of the power.</p>

<p>In this section, &quot;fiduciary decision&quot; means:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>A fiduciary's allocation between income and principal or other determination regarding income and principal required or authorized by the terms of the trust or this chapter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fiduciary's exercise or nonexercise of a discretionary power regarding income and principal granted by the terms of the trust or this chapter, including the power to adjust under RCW 11.104B.070, convert an income trust to a unitrust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(a), change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(c); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fiduciary's implementation of a decision described in (a) or (b) of this subsection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court may not order a fiduciary to change a fiduciary decision unless the court determines that the fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the court determines that a fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order a remedy authorized by law. To place the beneficiaries in the positions the beneficiaries would have occupied if there had not been an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion, the court may order:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to adjust under RCW 11.104B.070;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to convert an income trust to a unitrust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(a), change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under RCW 11.104B.120(1)(c);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fiduciary to distribute an amount to a beneficiary;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A beneficiary to return some or all of a distribution; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to a beneficiary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>On petition by a fiduciary for instruction, the court may determine whether a proposed fiduciary decision will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed decision, contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiary of the reasons for making the proposed decision and the facts on which the fiduciary relies, and explains how the beneficiary will be affected by the proposed decision, a beneficiary that opposes the proposed decision has the burden to establish that it will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.</p>

<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the terms of a trust or this section, a fiduciary, in a record, without court approval, may adjust between income and principal if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power to adjust is necessary to administer the trust or estate in accordance with the requirements of RCW 11.104B.050(1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section does not create a duty to exercise or consider the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section or to inform a beneficiary about the applicability of this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary that in good faith exercises or fails to exercise the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section is not liable to a person affected by the exercise or failure to exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section, a fiduciary shall consider all factors the fiduciary considers relevant, including relevant factors in RCW 11.104B.050(5) and the application of RCW 11.104B.200(9), 11.104B.270, or 11.104B.320.</p>

<li>
<p>The adjustment or determination would change the amount payable to a beneficiary, as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets, under the terms of the trust;</p>

<li>
<p>The adjustment or determination would reduce an amount that is permanently set aside for a charitable purpose under the terms of the trust, unless both income and principal are set aside for the charitable purpose;</p>

<li>
<p>Possessing or exercising the power would cause a person to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for federal income tax purposes;</p>

<li>
<p>Possessing or exercising the power would cause all or part of the value of the trust assets to be included in the gross estate of an individual for federal estate tax purposes;</p>
</li>

<p>The trust is a unitrust under Article 3 of this chapter.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no cofiduciary to which subsection (5)(d) through (g) of this section does not apply, the fiduciary may appoint a cofiduciary to which subsection (5)(d) through (g) of this section does not apply, which may be a special fiduciary with limited powers, and the appointed cofiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section, unless the appointment of a cofiduciary or the exercise of the power by a cofiduciary is not permitted by the terms of the trust or law other than this chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fiduciary may release or delegate to a cofiduciary the power to adjust under subsection (1) of this section if the fiduciary determines that the fiduciary's possession or exercise of the power will or may:</p>

<p>Cause a result described in subsection (5)(a) through (f) or (h) of this section; or</p>
