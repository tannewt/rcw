<p>Act so as not to create a conflict of interest that impairs the agent's ability to act impartially in the principal's best interest;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Unless RCW 11.125.110(1) applies, an agent may only delegate authority to another person if expressly authorized to do so in the power of attorney and may delegate some, but not all, of the authority granted by the principal. An agent that exercises authority to delegate to another person the authority granted by the principal is not liable for an act, error of judgment, or default of that person if the agent exercises care, competence, and diligence in selecting and monitoring the person, provided however that the agent shall not be relieved of liability for such person's discretionary acts, that, if done by the agent, would result in liability to the agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent is not required to disclose receipts, disbursements, or transactions conducted on behalf of the principal unless ordered by a court or requested in writing by the principal, a guardian, a conservator, another fiduciary acting for the principal, a governmental agency having authority to protect the welfare of the principal, or, upon the death of the principal, by the personal representative or successor in interest of the principal's estate. Such request by a guardian, conservator, or another fiduciary acting for the principal must be limited to information reasonably related to that guardian, conservator, or fiduciary's duties.
