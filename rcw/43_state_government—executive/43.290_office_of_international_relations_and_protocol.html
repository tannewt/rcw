<p>The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to create an office of international relations and protocol in order to: Make international relations and protocol a broad-based, focused, and functional part of state government; develop and promote state policies that increase international literacy and cross-cultural understanding among Washington state's citizens; expand Washington state's international cooperation role in such areas as the environment, education, science, culture, and sports; establish coordinated methods for responding to the increasing number of inquiries by foreign governments and institutions seeking cooperative activities within Washington state; provide leadership in state government on international relations and assistance to the legislature and state elected officials on international issues affecting the state; assist with multistate international efforts; and coordinate and improve communication and resource sharing among various state offices, agencies, and educational institutions with international programs.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to bring these functions together in a new office under the office of the governor in order to establish a visible, coordinated, and comprehensive approach to international relations and protocol.</p>
